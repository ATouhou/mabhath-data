سَوِىَ, aor. يَسْوَى: see 3, in two places.
-A2-
[Accord. to Golius, سَوَى, inf. n. سِوًى, signifies
He intended, or proposed to himself: this he says
as on the authority of the KL, in which only the
inf. n. is mentioned with the explanation قصد
وآهنگ كردن: and to this, Freytag adds the
authority of Meyd; and also that the verb governs
the thing which is its objective complement in the
accus. case. In the S and other lexicons of good
repute, I find the meaning of قَصَدَ assigned to
اِسْتَوَى followed by إِلَى; but in none to سَوَى.]

سوّاهُ, (S, M, &c.,) inf. n. تَسْوِيَةٌ, (K,) He
made it equal, equable, uniform, even, level,
flat, plane or plain; (S, * M, MA, Msb, K;) or
equal in respect of elevation or of depression;
(Er-Rághib, TA;) [and straight, right, direct,
or rightly directed; (see its quasi-pass. 8;)] and
↓ اسواهُ signifies the same; (M, K;) namely, a
place, (Msb, K,) or a thing, (S, M, Er-Rághib,
TA,) or an uneven, or a crooked, thing. (Mgh.)
It is said in a trad., فَأَمَرَ بِالخِرَبِ فَسُوِّيَتْ [And he
gave orders respecting the ruins, and they were
levelled]. (TA in art. خرب.) And in another
trad., سَوَّيْنَا عَلَى رُقَيَّةَ, meaning We buried Ru-
keiyeh, and made the earth of the grave even, or
level, over her. (Mgh.) [Hence also,] سُوِّيتْ
عَلَيْهِ الأَرْضُ: see 8. And hence the saying in the
Kur [iv. 45], لُوْ تُسَوَّى بِهِمُ الْأَرْضُ, (TA,) i. e.
That they were buried, and that the ground were
made level over them; (S, * Bd;) بِ being here
syn. with عَلَى: (TA in art. ب:) or the meaning
is, that they became like the dust of the earth;
(M, Jel;) thus expl. by Th; (M;) or that they
had not been created, and that they and the earth
were alike. (Bd.) [Hence also,] بَلَى قَادِرِينَ
عَلَى أَنْ نُسَوِّىَ بَنَانَهُ, in the same [lxxv. 4], is said
to mean [Yea: we are able] to make his hand
like the foot of the camel, without fingers: or to
make his fingers uniform, of one measure or size:
(TA:) or the meaning is, we are able to put
together the bones of his fingers [consistently] as
they were. (Bd, Jel.) And بَيْنَ ↓ حَتَّى إِذَا سَاوَى
الصَّدَفَيْنِ, in the Kur [xviii. 95], means سَوَّى
بَيْنَهُمَا [i. e. Until, when he had made the space
between the two sides of the mountains even, or
level, by filling it up]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Also He made
it uniform, equal, or consimilar, with another
thing.] One says, سَوَّيْتُهُ بِهِ, (M, K,) inf. n. as
above; (K;) and به ↓ سَاوَيْتُهُ, (M, * TA, TK,)
and به ↓ أَسْوَيْتُهُ; I made it uniform, or equal,
with it; or like it: (M, K, TA:) and ↓ سَاوَيْتُ
هٰذَا بِذَاكَ I raised this so as to make it equal in
measure, or quantity, or amount, with that. (TA.)
And سَوَّيْتُ بَيْنَهُمَا, and ↓ سَاوَيْتُ, (S, M, K,) I
made them uniform, or equal, each with the
other; or like each other. (M, K, TA.) ―
-b3-  [And
He made it symmetrical or symmetrically, by, or
with, a just adaptation of its component parts;
made it congruous or consistent in its several
parts, or with congruity or consistency in its
several parts: he made it, formed it, or fashioned
it, in a suitable manner: he made it to be
adapted, or so as to be adapted, to the exigencies,
or requirements, of its case, or of wisdom: he
made it complete, or in a complete manner; completed it, or completed its make: he made it
right or good, or in a right or good manner;
rectified it; adjusted it; or put it into a right,
or good, state.] In the Kur xxxii. 8, it means He
made him symmetrical [or symmetrically], by the
fit, or suitable, formation of his members. (Bd,)
And سَوَّيْتُهُ in the same, xv. 29 and xxxviii. 72,
I made his creation symmetrical: (Bd:) or I
completed him, or made him complete. (Jel.)
And سَوَّى in the same, lxxxvii. 2, He made what
He created congruous or consistent in the several
parts. (Jel.) And الَّذِى خَلَقَكَ فَسَوَّاكَ, in the
same [lxxxii. 7], means [Who created thee,] and
made thy creation to be adapted to the exigencies,
or requirements, of wisdom. (TA.) وَنَفْسٍ وَمَا
سَوَّاهَا, in the same, [xci. 7, means By a soul and
what made it to be adapted to its exigencies, i. e., to
the performance of its functions, for it] is indicative
of the faculties of the soul: this explanation is more
proper than that which makes ما to mean [Him
who, i. e.] God. (TA.) And رَفَعَ سَمْكَهَا فَسَوَّاهَا,
in the same, lxxix. 28, means He hath raised
high [its canopy, or] the measure of its elevation
from the earth, or its thickness upwards, and
made it symmetrical, or even, (Bd,) or completed
it by adorning it with the stars, (Bd, TA, *)
agreeably with what is said in the Kur xxxvii. 6,
(TA,) and by means of the revolvings [thereof],
&c.: from the saying next following. (Bd.) سوّى
فُلَانٌ أَمْرَهُ Such a one rectified, or adjusted, his
affair; or put it into a right, or good, state.
(Bd in lxxix. 28.) [Hence,] one says, سَوِّ وَلَا
تُسَوِّئْ Rectify thou, and do not corrupt, or mar.
(A and TA in art. سوأ.) [One says also, سوّى
الطَّعَامَ He cooked the food thoroughly: see 8 as
its quasi-pass.] And سوّى فُلَانٌ مَنْصُوبَةً [Such a
one framed a stratagem, or plot]. (TA in art.
نصب.)
-A2-  سَوَّى [as an intrans. verb, if not a mistranscription for سُوِّىَ], inf. n. as above: see 8.
-A3-
And سُوِّىَ, [app. for سُوِّئَ,] inf. n. as above, signifies It was, or became, altered [for the worse];
syn. غُيِّرَ. (TA.)
3
ساواهُ, (S, * M, * Msb,) inf. n. مُسَاوَاةٌ (M, Er-Rághib, Msb, TA) and سِوآءٌ, (M,) It was, or became, equal to it, (S, Er-Rághib, Msb, TA,) and
like it, in measure, extent, size, bulk, quantity, or
amount, and in value, (Msb, TA,) or in linear
measure, and in weight, and in the measure of
capacity, [as well as in value:] one says هٰذَا
لِذٰلِكَ الثَّوْبِ ↓ الثَّوْبُ مُسَاوٍ [This garment, or piece
of cloth, is equal in length and breadth to that
garment, or piece of cloth]; and هٰذَا الثَّوْبُ
لِذٰلِكَ الدِّرْهَمِ ↓ مُسَاوٍ [This garment, or piece of
cloth, is equivalent to that dirhem]: and sometimes it means in mode, or manner of being: one
says, لِذٰلِكَ السَّوَادِ ↓ هٰذَا السَّوَادُ [This blackness is equal in quality to this blackness]. Er-Rághib, TA.) It is said in a trad., سَاوَى الظِّلُّ
التِّلَالَ The shade, or shadow, was like, in its
extent, to the mounds, in their height. (TA.) [And
ساوى الشَّىْءُ رَأْسَهُ means The thing equalled in
height his head: see an ex. of the verb tropically
used in this sense voce سِىٌّ.] One says also, هٰذَا
يُسَاوِى دِرْهَمًا This is worth, or equal in its value
to, a dirhem: and in a rare dial., one says,
دِرْهَمًا ↓ سَوِىَ, aor. يَسْوَاهُ; (Msb, TA;) which AZ
disallows, saying, one says ساواه, but not يَسْوَاهُ.
(Msb.) And هٰذَا الشَّىْءُ لَا يُسَاوِى كَذَا This thing
is not equivalent to [or is not worth] such a thing:
(Fr, S:) or لَايُسَاوِى شَيْئًا [It (a garment, or some
other thing, M) is not worth anything]: (M, K:)
↓ لا يَسْوَى is of a rare dial., (K,) unknown to Fr,
(S,) disallowed by A'Obeyd, but mentioned by
others: (M:) Az says that it is not of the language
of the Arabs [of pure speech], (Msb, TA,) but is
post-classical; and in like manner ↓ لا يُسْوِى is
not correct Arabic: this last is with damm to the
[first] ى: MF says that the generality of authorities disallow it, and the Fs expressly disallows it,
but the expositors thereof say that it is correct and
chaste, of the dial. of the people of El-Hijáz,
though an instance of a verb of which the aor. only
is used. (TA.) One says likewise, ساوى الرَّجُلُ قِرْنَهُ
The man equalled his opponent, or competitor, in
knowledge, or in courage. (TA.) ―

اسوى as a trans. verb: see 2, in two places,
in the former half of the paragraph. ―
-b2-  لَايُسْوِى
in the sense of لَايُسَاوِى is not correct Arabic:
see 3, in the latter part of the paragraph.
-A2-  As
an intrans. verb: see 8. ―
-b2-  Also He was like his
son, or offspring, [in some copies of the K his
father, which, as is said in the TA, is a mistake,]
in make, (M, K,) or in symmetry, or justness of
proportion; (Fr, TA;) or simply he was like his
son, or offspring. (M.) [In this instance, and in
all the senses here following that are mentioned
in the K, the verb is erroneously written in the
CK استوى.] ―
-b3-  اسوى فِى المَرْأَةِ i. q. أَوْعَبَ, (M,
K, TA,) i. e. He inserted the whole of his ذَكَر
into the فَرْج [of the woman]. (TA.)
-A3-  Also, [as
though originally أَسْوَأَ,] He was, or became, base,
abased, object, vile, despicable, or ignominious;
syn. خَزِىَ; (M, K;) from السَّوْأَةُ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And
He voided his ordure; syn. أَحْدَثَ; (Az, M,
K;) [likewise] from السَّوْأَةُ, as meaning “ the
anus. ” (Az, TA.) ―
-b3-  And hence, in the opinion
of Az, and thought by J to be originally أَسْوَأَ [as
he says in the S], (TA,) [though trans.,] He
dropped, left out, omitted, or neglected, (S, M,
K,) and did so through inadvertence, (S, K,) a
thing, (S,) or a letter, or word, of the Kur-án,
(M, K,) or a verse thereof: (M:) mentioned by
A'Obeyd: (S:) and in like manner, accord. to
IAth, in reckoning, and in shooting, or casting:
and Hr says that أَشْوَى, with ش, is allowable, as
meaning أَسْقَطَ. (TA.) ―
-b4-  Also He was, or became, affected with بَرَص [or leprosy, which is
sometimes termed السُّوْءُ; so that the verb in this
sense also seems to be originally أَسْوَأَ]. (TA.) ―
-b5-
And He was, or became, restored to health, [or
free from سُوْءٌ as meaning an evil affection, (as
though the verb were in this sense likewise
originally أَسْوَأَ, the incipient أ being privative, as
it is in many other instances, like the Greek
privative
α,)] after a disease, or malady. (TA.)

تَسَاوَيَا They two were, or became, equal, like
each other, or alike; as also ↓ اِسْتَوَيَا. (M, K.)
↓ استوى has two and more agents assigned to it:
one says, استوى زَيْدٌ وُعَمْرُو وَخَالِدٌ فِى هٰذَا [Zeyd
and 'Amr and Khálid were equal, or alike, in
this]; i. e. تَسَاوَوْا: whence the saying in the Kur
[ix. 19], عِنْدَ اللّٰهِ ↓ لَا يَسْتَوُونَ [They will not be
equal, or alike, in the sight of God]. (TA.) And
one says, تَسَاوَوْا فِى المَالِ They were, or became,
equal in respect of the property, none of them
exceeding another; as also فِيهِ ↓ اِسْتَوَوْا. (Msb.)
It is said in a trad., as some relate it, ↓ مَنْ سَاوَى
يَوْمَاهُ فَهُوَ مَغْبُونٌ, in which the meaning is said to
be تَسَاوَى [i. e. He whose two days are alike,
neither being distinguished above the other by
any good done by him, is weak-minded]. (TA.)
And in another it is said, لَا يَزَالُ النَّاسُ بِخَيْرٍ مَا
تَفَاضَلُوا فَإِذَا تَسَاوَوْا هَلَكُوا, (S, * TA,) i. e. [Men
will not cease to be in a good state while they vie
in excellence,] but when they cease from vying in
excellent qualities and are content with defect
[and thus become alike, they perish]: or when
they become equal in ignorance: or when they
form themselves into parties and divisions, and
every one is alone in his opinion, and they do not
agree to acknowledge one exemplar or chief or
leader [so that they are all alike]: or, accord. to
Az, when they are alike in evil, there being none
among them possessed of good. (TA.)
8
استوى [seems, accord. to Bd, to signify
primarily He sought, or desired, what was equal,
equable, uniform, even, or the like: for he says
(in ii. 27) that the primary meaning of الاِسْتِوَآءُ
is طلَبُ السَّوَآءِ; app. indicating the sense in which
السوآء is here used by what follows. ―
-b2-  And hence,
accord. to him, but I would rather say primarily,
as being quasi-pass. of سَوَّاهُ,] It was, or became,
equal, equable, uniform, even, level, flat, plane or
plain, [or equal in respect of elevation or of depression, (see 2, first sentence,)] straight, right,
direct, or rightly directed; syn. اِعْتَدَلَ (S, M,
Msb, K, TA, and Ksh and Bd in ii. 27) فِى ذَاتِهِ,
(TA,) said of a place, (Msb,) and اِسْتَقَامَ, said of
a stick, or piece of wood, &c. (Ksh ubi suprà.)
And ↓ سَوَّى, [if not a mistranscription for سُوِّىَ,]
inf. n. تَسْوِيَةٌ, signifies the same as استوى [app.
meaning as above], accord. to IAar; and so does
↓ أَسْوَى, as also أَوْسَى, formed from it by transposition. (TA.) One says, اِسْتَوَتْ بِهِ الأَرْضُ [lit.
The earth, or ground, became equable, uniform,
even, &c., with him, he having been buried in it],
meaning he perished in the earth; as also
↓ تَسَوَّتْ, and عَلَيْهِ ↓ سُوِّيَتْ. (M, K.) And استوت
أَرْضُهُمْ Their land became [even in its surface,
being] affected with drought, or barrenness. (M, *
TA.) And استوى المَآءُ وَالخَشَبَةَ, meaning مَعَ
الخَشَبَةِ [i. e. The water became even, or level, with
the piece of wood]. (TA.) See also 6, in four
places. One says also, استوى المُعَوَّجُ [or المُعْوجُّ
(as in the MA) i. e. The crooked, or uneven,
became straight, or even]: (Mgh:) and استوى
مِنِ اعُوِجَاجٍ [It became even from a state of unevenness]. (S.) فَاسْتَوَى عَلَى سُوقِهِ, in the Kur
xlviii. last verse, means And has stood straight,
or erect, (Bd,) or become strong, and stood
straight, or erect, (Jel,) upon its stems. (Bd,
Jel. [Golius erroneously assigns a similar meaning to استسوى, a verb which I do not anywhere
find.]) And فَاسْتَوَى in the same, liii. 6, And he
stood straight, or erect, in his proper form in
which God created him: or was endowed by his
strength with power over the affair appointed to
him: (Bd:) or became firm, or steady. (Jel.)
استوى said of a stick &c. means It stood up or
erect: and was, or became, even, or straight:
hence one says, استوى إِلَيْهِ كَالسَّهْمِ المُرْسَلِ He,
or it, went towards him, or it, with an undeviating,
a direct, or a straight, course, like the arrow hot
forth: and hence, ثُمَّ اسْتَوَى إِلَى السَّمَآءِ is metaphorically said of God, in the Kur ii. 27 [and xli.
10]; (Ksh;) meaning (tropical:)  Then He directed himself
by his will to the [heaven, or] elevated regions,
(Ksh, Bd,) or upwards, (Ksh,) or to the heavenly
bodies; (Bd;) syn. عَمَدَ, (Zj, M, K,) and قَصَدَ
(Zj, S, M, K, and Ksh and Bd) بِإِرَادَتِةِ; (Ksh,
Bd;) for when الاِسْتِوَآءُ is trans. by means of إِلَى
it imports the meaning of the directing of oneself,
or, as in this case, of one's design: (TA;) you
say of any one who has finished a work and has
directed himself to another, قَدِ اسْتَوَى لَهُ and إِلَيْهِ:
(Har p. 631:) or the meaning here is صَعِدَ, (Zj,
M, K,) or صَعِدَ أَمْرُهُ [i. e. his command ascended];
(M;) and this is what is intended here by صَعِدَ:
(TA:) or أَقْبَلَ عَلَيْهَا [i. e. He advanced to it,
namely, the heaven]; (Fr, Th, M, K;) like as one
says, كَانَ فُلَانٌ مُقْبِلًا عَلَى فُلَانٍ ثُمَّ اسْتَوَى عَلَىَّ
يُشَاتِمُنِى and إِلَىّض also, meaning أَقْبَلَ [i. e. Such a
one was advancing against such a one, then he
advanced against me, and to me, reviling me, or
contending with me in reviling]: (TA:) or it
means اِسْتَوْلَى, (M, K,) as some say: (M:) J
says, [in the S,] but not explaining thereby the
verse above cited, that it signifies also اِسْتَوْلَى and
ظَهَرَ [as meaning He had, or gained, the mastery,
or victory]: and hence the saying of El-Akhtal,
cited by him [in the S,]
قَدِ اسْتَوَى بِشْرٌ عَلَى العِرَاقِ
مِنْ غَيْرِ سَيْفٍ وَدَمٍ مُهْرَاقِ
[Bishr has gained the mastery over El-'Irák
without sword and without shed blood]: Er-Rághib says that when this verb is trans. by
means of عَلَى, it imports the meaning of الاِسْتِيلَآء;
as in the saying in the Kur [xx. 4], اَلرَّحْمٰنُ عَلَى
الْعَرْشِ اسْتَوَى [which may be rendered, The Compassionate hath ascendancy over the empyrean so
as to have everything in the universe equally
within his grasp; agreeably with what here
follows]: he then adds, it is said to mean that
everything is alike in relation to Him in such
manner that no one thing is nearer to Him
than another thing, since He is not like the
bodies that abide in one place exclusively of another place. (TA.) The saying لَمَّا اسْتَوَتْ بِهِ
رَاحِلَتُهُ عَلَى البَيْدَآءِ means [When his riding-camel]
ascended with him upon the desert: or stood up
with him straight upon its legs. (Mgh.) And
one says, استوى عَلَى ظَهْرِ دَابَّتِهِ, (S, TA,) or
عَلَى الفَرَسِ, (Msb,) He was, or became, firm, or
steady, [or he settled himself, or became firmly
seated, or sat firmly,] upon the back of his beast,
or upon the horse: (S, Msb, TA:) and استوى
جَالِسًا [He became firm, or steady, sitting; or he
settled himself in his sitting place; or sat firmly].
(Msb.) [استوى as quasi-pass. of سَوَّاهُ also signifies It was made, or became, symmetrical; congruous, or consistent in its several parts: was
made, formed, or fashioned, in a suitable manner:
was made, or became, adapted to the exigencies,
or requirements, of its case, or of wisdom: was
made, or became, complete: was made, or became,
right, or good; became rectified, adjusted, or put
into a right or good state. And hence,] استوى
الرَّجُلُ i. q. بَلَغَ أَشُدَّهُ [q. v.]; (M, K;) [generally
meaning] The man [became full-grown, of full
vigour, or mature, in body, or in body and intellect; i. e.] attained the utmost limit of [the
period termed] his شَبَاب; (S;) or attained the
utmost limit of his شَبَاب, and the completion of
his make and of his intellect, by the completion of
from twenty-eight to thirty [years]: (T, TA:)
or attained to forty (T, M, K) years. (K.) And
استوى الطَّعَامُ The food became thoroughly cooked.
(Msb.) [خَطُّ الاِسْتِوَآءِ means The equinoctial line.]
سَىٌّ, [app. a dial. var. of سِىٌّ]: see لَا سِيَّمَا, in
the next paragraph.
سِىٌّ, originally سِوْىٌ; and its dual: see سَوَآءٌ,
in ten places, all except one in the latter half of
the paragraph. ―
-b2-  [Hence,] of him who is, or
has become, in a state of wealth, or welfare, [or
rather, of abundant wealth or welfare,] one says,
هُوَ فِى سِىِّ رَأْسِهِ and رَأْسِهِ ↓ سَوَآءِ, (Fr, S,) or وَقَعَ
فِى سِىِّ رَأْسِهِ [in the CK (erroneously) سَىِّ] and
رأسه ↓ سَوَآءِ (M, K) and رأسه ↓ سِوَآءِ, (K,) or وَقَعَ
رأسه ↓ مِنَ النِّعْمَةِ فِى سِوَآءِ, (Ks, M,) i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [He is
in, or has lighted upon, or come upon,] what is in
the predicament of his head (حُكْمِ رَأْسِهِ) [in point
of eminence, of wealth, or welfare]: or what
covers his head [thereof]: (M, K:) or what
equals his head [in eminence] (يُسَاوِى رَأْسَهُ), of
wealth, or welfare: (T, TA:) or what has equalled
his head [in eminence], of wealth, or welfare; i. e.
what has accumulated upon him, and filled [or
satisfied] him: (M:) or [what equals] the number
of the hairs of his head, of wealth, or good;
(A'Obeyd, S, K;) as some explain it. (A'Obeyd,
S.) See also سِنٌّ, last sentence but one. ―
-b3-
[Hence likewise,] لَا سِيَّمَا, (S, M, Msb, K,) also
pronounced لا سِيَمَا, without teshdeed, (Msb,
Mughnee, K,) and ↓ لا سَيَّمَا is a dial. var. thereof,
(Msb,) a compound of سِىّ and مَا, denoting exception: (S:) one says, لَا سِيَّمَا زَيْدٍ, i. e. لَا مِثْلَ
زَيْدٍ [lit. There is not the like of Zeyd; virtually,
and generally, meaning above all Zeyd, or especially Zeyd]; مَا being redundant: and لا سيّما
زَيْدٌ also; like as one says, دَعْ مَا زَيْدٌ: (M, K:)
[J says,] with respect to the case of the noun
following ما, there are two ways: you may make
مَا to be in the place of الَّذِى, and mean that an
inchoative is to be understood, [namely, هو or the
like,] and put the noun that you mention in the
nom. case as the enunciative; thus you may say,
جَآءَنِى القَوْمُ لَا سِيَّمَا أَخُوكَ, meaning لَا سِىَّ الَّذِى
هُوَ أَخُوكَ [i. e. The people, or party, came to me,
and there was not the like of him who is thy
brother; or above all, or especially, he who is thy
brother]: (S, TA: [thus in a copy of the S: in
other copies of the same, and in the TA, for
سِىَّ, سِيَّمَا:]) but this rendering is invalidated
in such a phrase as وَلَا سِيَّمَا زَيْدٌ by the supression of the correlative of the noun in the nom.
case where there is no lengthiness, and by the
applying ما to denote a rational being: (Mughnee:) or you may put the noun after it in the
gen. case, making ما redundant, and making سِىّ
to govern the noun in that case because the meaning of سِىّ is مِثْل: [and this is the preferable
way:] (Mughnee:) in both of these ways is
recited the saying of Imra-el-Keys,
أَلَا رُبَّ يُوْمٍ لَكَ مِنْهُنَّ صَالِحٍ
وَلَا سِيَّمَا يَوْمٌٍ بِدَارَةِ جُلْجُلِ
[Verily many a good day was there to thee by
reason of them; but there was not the like of a
day, or above all a day, or especially a day, at
Dárat Juljul, a certain pool, where Imra-el-Keys
surprised his beloved, 'Oneyzeh, with others, her
companions, bathing: see EM pp. 9 and 10]: you
say also, أَضْرِبُ القَوْمَ وَلَا سِيَّمَا أَخِيكَ, meaning وَلَا
مِثْلَ ضَرْبِ أَخِيكَ [i. e. I will beat the people, or
party, but there shall not be the like of the beating of thy brother]: and if you say, وَلَا سِيَّمَا أَخُوكَ,
the meaning is, وَلَا مِثْلَ الَّذِى هُوَ أَخُوكَ [and there
shall not be the like of him who is thy brother]:
in the saying إِنَّ فُلَانًا كَرِيمٌ وَلَا سِيَّمَا إِنْ أَتَيْتَهُ
قَاعِدًا, accord. to Akh, ما is a substitute for the
affixed pronoun هُ, which is suppressed; the meaning being, وَلَا مِثْلَهُ إِنْ أَتَيْتَهُ قَاعِدًا [i. e. Verily
such a one is generous, and there is not the like
of him if thou come to him sitting]: (S, TA:)
it is said in the Msb, [after explaining that ما in
سيّما may be redundant, and the noun after it
governed in the gen. case as the complement of a
prefixed noun; and that ما may be used in the
sense of الّذى, and the noun following put in the
nom. case as the enunciative of the inchoative هو
which is suppressed;] that, accord. to some, the
noun following may be in the accus. case, as
being preceded by an exceptive; [or, as a specificative; (Mughnee;) in which case we must regard ما as a substitute for the affixed pronoun هُ;]
but that this is not a good way; [and in this case,
accord. to the generality of the authorities, it must
be an indeterminate noun, not, like زَيْدٌ, determinate: (Mughnee:)] also that سيّما should not
be used without لا preceding it: and that it
denotes the predominance of what follows it over
what precedes it: but it is added that لا is sometimes suppressed [as is said in the Mughnee]
because known to be meant, though this is rare.
(TA.) One says also, لَاسِىَّ لِمَا فُلَانٌ (Lh, M,
K) i. e. There is not the like of such a one: (TA:)
and لَا سِيَّكَ مَا فُلَانٌ (Lh, M, K) i. e. Such a one
is not the like of thee. (TA.) [In both of these
instances, ما is obviously redundant. Other
(similar) usages of سِىّ are mentioned voce سَوَآءٌ,
to which reference has been made above.] ―
-b4-
سِىٌّ also signifies A [desert such as is termed]
مُفَازَة; (S, M, K) because of the evenness of its
routes, and its uniformity. (TA.) [Hence السِّىُّ
is the name of a particular tract, said in the M to
be a certain smooth place in the بَادِيَة.] ―
-b5-  See
also art. سيو.
سِيَّة: see سَوَآء, near the end of the paragraph.
سُوًى: see سَوَآءٌ, in seven places: ―
-b2-  and see
also سِوًى, in two places.
سِوًى: see سَوَاءٌ, in seven places. ―
-b2-  Also, and
likewise ↓ سُوًى, (Akh, S, Msb, Mughnee, K,)
and ↓ سَوَآءٌ, (Akh, S, M, Mughnee, K,) and ↓ سِوَآءٌ,
(Mughnee,) i. q. مَكَانٌ, (Mughnee,) or غَيْرٌ, (Akh,
S, M, Msb, Mughnee, K,) accord. to different
authorities: each used as an epithet, and as denoting exception, like غَيْر; accord. to Ez-Zejjájee
and Ibn-Málik, used in the same sense and manner
as غَيْر: but accord. to Sb and the generality of
authorities, an adv. n. of place, always in the
accus. case, except in instances of necessity:
(Mughnee:) one says, عِنْدِى رَجُلٌ سِوَى زَيْدٍ,
meaning بَدَلَ زَيْدٍ and مَكَانَ زَيْدٍ [i. e. I have with
me a man instead of Zeyd and in the place of
Zeyd]: (Ham p. 570, and TA: *) [but] one says
[also] مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ سِوَاكَ and ↓ سُوَاكَ and ↓ سَوَائِكَ,
meaning غَيْرِكَ [i. e. I passed by a man other than
thee]: (S:) and ↓ جَآءَنِى سَوَاؤُكَ [and سِوَاك &c.
Other than thou came to me], using it as an
agent; and ↓ رَأَيْتُ سَوَآءَكَ [and سِوَاكَ &c. I saw
other than thee], using it as an objective complement: and ↓ مَا جَآءَنِى أَحَدٌ سَوَآءَكَ [and سِوَاكَ &c.
None except thou came to me]: and مَا جَآءَنِى أَحَدٌ
↓ سَوَاؤُكَ [and سِوَاكَ &c. None other than thou
came to me]: (Mughnee:) and قَصَدْتُ القَوْمَ سِوَى
زَيْدٍ, meaning غَيْرَ زَيْدٍ [i. e. I betook myself to, or
towards, the people, or party, others than Zeyd,
which is virtually the same as except Zeyd]:
(Msb:) and لَئِنْ فَعَلْتَ ذَاكَ وَأَنَا سِوَاكَ لَيَأْتِيَنَّكَ مِنِّى
مَا تَكْرَهُ, meaning [If thou do that] when I am in
a land other than thy land, [what thou dislikest,
or hatest, shall assuredly come to thee from me.]
(Ibn-Buzurj, TA.) ―
-b3-  The Arabs also said, عَقْلُكَ
سِوَاكَ, meaning Thine intellect has departed from
thee. (IAar, M.)
-A2-  The strangest of the meanings of سِوَى, in this sense with the short alif and
with kesr, is قَصْدٌ. (Mughnee.) سِوَى الشَّىْءِ
means قَصْدُهُ [i. e. The tendency, or direction, of
the thing]. (M.) And one says, قَصَدْتُ سِوَى
فُلَانٍ, meaning قَصَدْتُ قَصْدَهُ [i. e. I tended, or
betook myself, in the direction of, or towards,
such a one]. (S, K. * [In the CK, and in my
MS. copy of the K, سَوَاهُ is erroneously put for
سِوَاهُ.]) And hence, (Mughnee,) a poet says,
(namely, Keys Ibn-El-Khateem, TA,)
وَلَأَصْرِفَنَّ سِوَى حُذَيْفَةَ مِدْحَتِى
[And I will surely turn towards Hodheyfeh my
eulogy]. (S, Mughnee.)
سَوَآءٌ [in some copies of the K erroneously
written without ء] in its primary acceptation is an
inf. n., [but without a proper verb, used as a
simple subst.,] meaning Equality, equability,
uniformity, or evenness; syn. اِسْتِوَآءٌ; (Mughnee;)
as also ↓ سَوِيَّةٌ: (M, K:) or [rather] it is a subst.,
(S, and Ksh and Bd in ii. 5,) meaning اِسْتِوَآءٌ,
(Ksh and Bd ibid.,) from اِسْتَوَى in the sense of
اِعْتَدَلَ; (S;) and signifies [as above: and] equity,
justice, or rectitude; syn. عَدْلٌ; (S, M, K;) as
also ↓ سَوِيَّةً; (M;) and ↓ سِوًى and ↓ سُوًى, as
well as سَوَآءٌ, accord. to Fr, are syn. with نَصَفٌ;
and accord. to him, (TA,) and to Akh, (S, TA,)
syn. with عَدْلٌ; (S, K, TA;) [but app., only syn.
with عَدْلٌ and نَصَفٌ not as a subst. but as an
epithet, like وَسَطٌ thus used, as will be shown by
what follows, although] each said by Er-Rághib
to be originally an inf. n. (TA.) One says, هُمَا
مِنْ هٰذَا الأَمْرِ ↓ عَلَى سَوِيَّةً, meaning سَوَآءٍ [i. e.
They two are on an equality, or on a par, in
respect of this affair, or case]: (S, TA:) and
↓ هُمْ عَلَى سَوِيَّةٍ, meaning [likewise] اِسْتِوَآءٌ [i. e.
They are on an equality, or on a par], (M, K,)
فِى هٰذَا الأَمْرِ [in this affair, or case]. (M.) And
↓ قَسَمْتُ الشَّىْءَ بَيْنَهُمَا بِالسَّوِيَّةِ, (S,) meaning بِالعَدْلِ
[i. e. I divided the thing between them two with
equity, justice, or rectitude]. (TA.) And it is
said in the Kur [viii. 60], فَانْبِذْ إِلَيْهِمْ عَلَى سَوَآءٍ,
meaning عَدْلٍ [as expl. in art. نبذ, q. v.]. (S, *
TA.) [Hence,] لَيْلَةُ السَّوَآءِ The night of the
thirteenth [of the lunar month; the first being
that on which the new moon is first seen]; (As,
S, K, TA;) in which the moon becomes equable
or uniform (يَسْتَوِى) [in illumination]: (TA:)
or the night of the fourteenth. (M, K.) ―
-b2-  And
i. q. وَسَطٌ [as meaning The middle, or midst, of a
thing]; (S, M, Mughnee, K;) as also ↓ سُوًى and
↓ سِوًى. (Lh, M, K.) Hence, سَوَآءُ الشَّىْءِ The
middle, or midst, of the thing; (S, M;) as also
↓ سُوَاهُ and ↓ سِوَاهُ. (Lh, M.) It is said in the
Kur [xxxvii. 53,] فَرَآهُ فِى سَوَآءِ الْجَحِيمِ [And he
shall see him] in the middle or midst [of the fire of
Hell]. (S, * Mughnee, TA.) In like manner also
one says سَوَآءُ السَّبِيلِ [The middle of the road]:
or, accord. to Fr, it means the right direction of
the road or way. (TA.) And one says, اِنْقَطَعَ
سَوَائِى, meaning My waist [broke], or my middle.
(TA.) And سَوَآءُ النَّهَارِ means The middle of the
day. (M, K. [In some copies of the K, مُتَّسَعُهُ
is erroneously put for مُنْتَصَفُهُ.]) ―
-b3-  [Hence, perhaps, as being generally the middle or nearly so,]
The summit of a mountain. (M, K.) And An
[eminence, or a hill, or the like, such as is termed]
أَكَمَة: or a [stony tract such as is termed] حَرَّة:
or the head of a حَرَّة. (M.)
-A2-  It is also used as
an epithet; (Mughnee;) and signifies Equal,
equable, uniform, or even; syn. ↓ مُسْتَوٍ; (M,
Mughnee, K;) applied in this sense to a place;
(Mughnee;) as also, thus applied, ↓ سَوِىٌّ, and
↓ سِىٌّ; (M, K;) or these two signify, thus applied, [like سَوَآءٌ as expl. hereafter,] equidistant in
respect of its two extremities. (TA.) And as
syn. with ↓ مُسْتَوٍ, it is applied [to a fem. noun as
well as to a sing., and] to one and more than one,
because it is originally an inf. n.; whence the
phrase لَيْسُوا سَوَآءً [They are not equal; in the
Kur iii. 109]. (Mughnee.) Using it in this sense,
one says أَرْضٌ سَوَآءٌ [An even land]: and دَارٌ سَوَآءٌ
A house uniform (↓ مُسْتَوِيَةٌ) in respect of the
[appertenances termed] مَرَافِق: and ثَوْبٌ سَوَآءٌ A
garment, or piece of cloth, equal, or uniform,
(↓ مُسْتَوٍ,) in its breadth and its length and its
two lateral edges: but one does not say جَمَلٌ سَوَآءٌ,
nor حَمَارٌ سَوَآءٌ, nor رَجُلٌ سَوَآءٌ: (M, TA:) though
one says رَجُلٌ سَوَآءُ البَطْنِ A man whose belly is
even with the breast: and سَوَآءُ القَدَمِ having no
hollow to the sole of his foot. (TA.) One says
also الخَلْقِ ↓ رَجُلٌ سَوِىٌّ, (S, M,) meaning ↓ مُسْتَوٍ
[i. e. A man uniform in make, or symmetrical;
or full-grown, of full vigour, or mature in body,
or in body and intellect: see 8]: (S:) and رَجُلٌ
↓ سَوِىٌّ A man equally free from excess and deficiency in his dispositions and his make: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or sound in limbs: (TA voce مِرَّةٌ,
q. v.:) and ↓ غُلَامٌ سَوِىٌّ A boy, or young man,
uniform in make, or symmetrical, (الخَلْقِ ↓ مُسْتَوِى,)
without disease, and without fault, or defect:
(Mgh:) and the fem. is سَوِيَّةٌ. (M.) Accord. to
Er-Rághib, ↓ السَّوِىُّ signifies That which is preserved from excess and deficiency: and hence
↓ الصِّرَاطِ السَّوِىِّ [in Kur xx. last verse, as
though meaning The road, or way that neither
exceeds, nor falls short of, that which is right];
(Er-Rághib, TA;) the right, or direct, road:
(Bd, Jel:) and some read السَّوَآءِ, meaning the
middle, good, road: and السَّوْءِ (Ksh, Bd) i. e. the
evil, or bad, road: (Bd:) and السُّوْءَى [i. e. most
evil, or worst; fem. of أَسْوَأُ; for الصِّرَاطُ is fem. as
well as masc.]: (Ksh, Bd:) [and] ↓ السُّوَىَ, of the
measure فُعْلَى from السَّوَآءُ, [with which it is syn.,]
or originally السُّوْءَى [mentioned above]: (K:)
and ↓ السُّوَىِّ, (Ksh, Bd,) which is dim. of السَّوَآء,
(Lth, TA,) [or] as dim. of السَّوْء [in which case
it is for السُّوَىْءِ]. (Ksh, Bd.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] it signifies also Complete: (Mughnee:) you say, هٰذَا
دِرْهَمٌ سَوَآءٌ (M, Mughnee) This is a complete
dirhem; (Mughnee;) using the last word as an
epithet: and سَوَآءً also, using it as an inf. n., as
though you said اِسْتِوَآءً: and in like manner in the
Kur xli. 9, some road سَوَآءً; and others, سَوَآءٍ.
(M.) ―
-b3-  And Equitable, just, or right; syn.
عَدْلٌ: used in this sense in the saying in the
Kur [iii. 57], تَعَالَوْا إِلَى كَلِمَةٍ سَوَآءٍ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَكُمْ
[Come ye to an equitable, or a just, or right,
sentence, or proposition, between us and you].
(Az, TA.) ―
-b4-  And Equidistant, or midway,
(عَدْلٌ, and وَسَطٌ, S, or نَصَفٌ, Mughnee,) between
two parties, (S,) or between two places; (Mughnee;) applied as an epithet to a place; as also
↓ سِوًى and ↓ سُوًى; (S, Mughnee;) of which
three words the second (سِوًى) is the most chaste;
(Mughnee;) or the last two signify equal (مُسْتَوٍ)
in respect of its two extremities; and are used as
epithets and as adv. ns.; originally, inf. ns. (Er-Rághib, TA.) ↓ مَكَانًا سِوًى and ↓ سُوًى, (M, K,)
in the Kur xx. 60, accord. to different readings,
means A place equidistant, or midway, (Ksh,
Bd, Jel,) between us and thee, (Ksh, Bd,) or to
the comer from each of the two extremities:
(Jel:) or مَكَانٌ سِوًى and سُوًى means مُعْلَمٌ [i. e.
a place marked], (so in a copy of the M and in
one of the K,) or مَعْلَمٌ, (so in other copies of the
K and in the TA,) which is for ذُو مَعْلَمٍ, meaning
having a mark, or sign, by which one is guided,
or directed, thereto. (MF, TA.) ―
-b5-  [Also Equal,
or alike, in any respect.] One says, مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ
سَوَآءٍ وَالعَدَمُ, (M, Mughnee, K,) and وَالعَدَمُ ↓ سِوَآءٍ,
(K,) and وَالعَدَمُ ↓ سِوًى, and وَالعَدَمُ ↓ سُوًى, (M,
K,) meaning وُجُودُهُ وَعَدَمُهُ سَوَآءٌ [i. e. I passed by
a man whose existence and whose non-existence
are equal, or alike, to me, or in my opinion]:
(M, K: *) and Sb mentions the phrase, سَوَآءٌ هُوَ
وَالعَدَمُ [as meaning His existence and his nonexistence are equal, or alike, to me]. (M.) And
سَوَآءٌ عَلَىَّ قُمْتَ أَوْ قَعَدْتَ [It is equal, or alike, to
me, that thou stand or that thou sit, or whether
thou stand or sit; or that thou stand or that thou
sit is equal, or alike, to me: see Kur ii. 5, and
the expositions thereof]. (S.) [And ↓ سِوًى is
used as an adv. n., or as an inf. n. adverbially,
meaning Alike: see an ex. in a verse cited voce
سَبْتٌ.] ―
-b6-  Also A like; a similar person or thing;
(S, M, K;) and so ↓ سِىٌّ: [each used as masc.
and fem.; and the former as sing. and dual and
pl., though having proper dual and pl. forms:]
the pl. of the former is أَسْوَآءٌ, (S, M, K,) and also,
(S, * K,) but anomalous, (S,) or [rather] quasi-pl.
ns., all anomalous, (M,) ↓ سَوَاسِيَةٌ (S, M, K) and
↓ سَوَاسٍ and ↓ سَوَاسِوَةٌ: (M, K:) and أَسْوَآءٌ is also
pl. of ↓ سِىٌّ: (TA:) as to ↓ سَوَاسِيَةٌ, Akh says,
سَوَآءٌ is of the measure فَعَالٌ, and سِيَةٌ may be of
the measure فِعَةٌ or فِلَةٌ, the former of which is the
more agreeable with analogy, the و being changed
into ى in سِيَةٌ because of the kesreh before it, for
it is originally سِوْيَةٌ; and it is from أَسْوَيْتُ الشَّىْءَ
meaning “ I neglected the thing: ” [see 4:] (S:)
accord. to Aboo-'Alee, the ى in سَوَاسِيَةٌ is changed
from the و in سَوَاسِوَةٌ, in which latter some preserve it to show that it is the final radical: (M:)
accord. to Fr, سَوَاسِيَةٌ has no sing., and relates only
to equality in evil: (T, TA:) so in the saying,
سَوَاسِيَةٌ كَأَسْنَانِ الحِمَارِ
[Equals like the teeth of the ass]. (TA.) It requires two [or more nouns for its subjects]: you
say, سَوَآءٌ زَيْدٌ وَعَمْرٌو, meaning ذَوَا سَوَآءٍ [i. e., lit.,
Two possessors of equality, or likeness, are Zeyd
and 'Amr], (M, K,) because it is [originally] an
inf. n.: (M:) and هُمَا فِى هٰذَا الأَمْرِ سَوَآءٌ [They
two are in this affair, or case, likes]: (S:) and
هُمَا سَوَاآنِ (S, M, K) and ↓ سِيَّانِ i. e. They two
are likes: (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K:) and هُمْ سَوَآءٌ and
أَسْوَآءٌ and ↓ سَوَاسِيَةٌ i. e. They are likes; (S;
[the first and last of these three are mentioned in
the Mgh as identical in meaning;]) or, accord.
to Fr, the last means they are equals in evil, not
in good: (T, TA:) and ↓ مَاهُوَ لَكَ بِسِىٍّ He is not
a person like to thee: and مَاهُمْ لَكَ بِأَسْوَآءٍ [They
are not persons like to thee]: (Lh, M:) and
↓ مَاهِىَ لَكَ بِسِىٍّ (Lh, M, K *) i. e. She is not a
person like to thee: (TA:) and مَاهُنَّ لَكَ بِأَسْوَآءٍ
[They (females) are not persons like to thee]:
and لِمَنْ فَعَلَ ذَاكَ ↓ لَا سِىَّ [There is not a like to
him who did that]: and إِذَا فَعَلْتَ ذَاكَ ↓ لَا سِيَّكَ
[There is not the like of thee when thou doest
that]: (Lh, M, K:) and فُلَانٍ ↓ لَا سِيَّةَ (K)
[There is not the like of such a one: in the CK,
فُلَانٌ: perhaps the right reading is فُلَانٌ ↓ لَا سِيَّكَ
Such a one is not the like of thee]. سَوَآءٌ and
↓ سِيَّانِ should not be used with أَوْ in the place of وَ
except by poetic license: one of the exceptions to
this rule is the saying of Aboo-Dhu-eyb,
وَكَانَ سِيَّانِ أَلَّا يَسْرَحُوا نَعَمًا
أَوْ يَسْرَحُوهُ بِهَا وَاغْبَرَّتِ السُّوحُ
[And they were two like cases that they should
not send forth cattle to pasture or send him forth
with them when the tracts were very dusty by
reason of drought]. (M.) For two other exs. of
سَوَآء, [as well as of its syn. سِىّ, and for لَا سِيَّمَا
also,] see سِىٌّ. ―

stuffed with panic grass (ثُمَام), (S, M, K, and
L in art. كرب,) or palm-fibres (لِيف), (M,) or
the like, (S, M, and L ubi suprà,) resembling the
بَرْذَعَة [q. v.], (S, and L ubi suprà,) which is put
on the back of the camel, (M,) or on the back of
the ass &c., (L ubi suprà,) and which is one of the
vehicles of female slaves and of necessitous persons: (M:) and likewise such as is put upon the
back of the camel, but in the form of a ring

سَوَّآءٌ لَوَّآءٌ, each of the measure فَعَّالٌ, irregularly
derived from اِسْتَوَى and اِلْتَوَى; a prov., applied
to women, meaning Straight and bending, and
collecting together and separating; not remaining
in one state, or condition. (Meyd.) ―
-b2-  And
أَرْضٌ سَوَّآءٌ Land of which the earth, or dust, is
like sand. (IAth, TA.)
سَايَةٌ is [held by some to be] of the measure
فَعْلَةُ from التَّسْوِيَةُ [inf. n. of سوّى]; (K;) mentioned by Az on the authority of Fr; but in
copies of the T, فَعْلَةٌ from السَّوِيَّةُ. (TA.) One
says, ضَرَبَ لِى سَايَةً, meaning He prepared for me
a speech: (K:) or an evil speech, which he
framed (سَوَّاهَا) against me to deceive me: mentioned by Az on the authority of Fr. (TA.) [See
the same word in art. سوأ.]
أَسْوَى [More, and most, equal, equable, uniform, or even: and more, or most, equitable,
&c.]. One says, هٰذَا المَكَانُ أَسْوَى هٰذِهِ الأَمْكِنَةِ
i. e. [This place is] the most even [of these places].

صَالِحِينَ ↓ مُسْتَوِينَ [as enunciatives of أَصْبَحْنَا or
أَمْسَيْنَا understood, but I think that مُسْتَوِينَ is a
mistranscription for مُسْوِينَ], meaning In a good,
right, state, with respect to our children and our
cattle. (S, M, TA.)
