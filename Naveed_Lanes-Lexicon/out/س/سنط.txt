سنط1
سَنُطَ, aor.
سَنُطَ; (M, K;) or سَنِطَ, aor.
سَنَطَ, inf. n.
سَنَطٌ; (Msb;) or both; (TA;) He was, or
became, such as is termed سِنَاطٌ [q. v.]. (M,
Msb, K.)
سَنْطٌ [The mimosa Nilotica; also called acacia
Nilotica;] a قَرَظ, [or this is properly the name
of its fruit,] (M, K,) which grows in the صَعِيد
[or Upper Egypt], (M,) or [rather] in Egypt;
[for it grows in Lower, as well as Upper, Egypt;]
(K;) it is the best kind of firewood of the people
of that country, who assert that it has most
of fire, and least of ashes; so says AHn, on the
authority of a person well informed; and he adds
that they tan with it [or rather with its pods]:
the word is foreign: (M:) and is also written
صَنْطٌ: Sgh says that is an arabicized word, from
the Indian حبذ. [So in the TA, doubtless a mistranscription. In the CK, السّنَطُ is erroneously
put for السَّنْطُ.]

K:) or i. q. كَوْسَجٌ: (Mgh:) or whose beard is
on his chin [only], having nothing on the sides of
the face: (As, K:) or this last signification,
accord. to As, applies to سَنُوطٌ: (TA:) the pl. (of
سَنُوطٌ accord. to some copies of the K and the
TA) is سُنُطٌ (IAar, K) and أَسْنَاطٌ [which is a pl.
of pauc.]: (K:) سناط is used as a sing. and pl.
