سوف1
سَافَ الشَّىْءَ, aor. يَسُوفُ (S, M, Msb) and
يَسَافُ, (M,) inf. n. سَوْفٌ; (S, M, K;) and so
↓ ساوفهُ; (M, TA;) and ↓ استافهُ, (M, Msb, K, *)
inf. n. اِسْتِيَافٌ; (S;) [and, accord. to Freytag,
↓ سوّفهُ; but he has not named his authority; if
correct, probably having an intensive signification;] He smelled the thing. (S, M, Msb.) A
poet says, (Msb,) namely, Ru-beh, (S, M,)
أَخْلَاقَ الطُّرُقْ ↓ إِذَا الدَّلِيلُ اسْتَافَ
[When the guide smells the natures of the roads
to know whether he be pursuing the right course
or deviating therefrom]. (S, M, Msb.) ―
-b2-  [And
hence, He hunted. (Freytag, from the Deewán
el-Hudhaleeyeen.)]
-A2-  سَوْفٌ is also Syn. with صَبْرٌ.
(IAar, K.) You say, of a man, ساف عَلَيْهِ, inf. n.
سَوْفٌ, He endured it with patience. (TK.)
-A3-
سَافَ, (S, M, O, K,) aor. يَسُوفُ (S, O, K) and
يَسَافُ, (O, K,) inf. n. سَوْفٌ, (M,) said of a man,
(M,) and of cattle, (مَال, M, O, K,) He, or they,
perished, or died: (S, M, O, K:) or, said of
cattle, they had a murrain occurring among
them. (K.)
-A4-  [سَافَ expl. by Freytag in this art.,
as though having for its aor. يَسُوفُ, and meaning
He smote a person with a sword, is a mistake,
caused by a mistranscription (of سُفْتُهُ for سِفْتُهُ) in
art. سيف in some copies of the K.]
2
سوّفهُ, (S, M, K,) or سوّف بِهِ, (Msb,) inf. n.
تَسْوِيفٌ, (S, M, Msb, K,) He said to him time
after time سَوْفَ أَفْعَلُ [I will do such a thing];
(S, Msb, TA;) derived from the particle سَوْفَ:
(IJ, M:) and hence, (Msb,) he delayed, or deferred, with him; or put him off with promises;
syn. مَطَلَهُ; (S, * Msb, K, TA;) saying سَوْفَ أَفْعَلُ;
(TA;) or promising to be faithful to his engagement; (Msb;) mostly used in relation to a promise
that is not to be fulfilled; as is said by Ibn-Abi1-Hadeed: (MF, TA:) and ↓ ساوفهُ signifies [the
same, as is implied in the M, being syn. with]
مَاطِلَهُ: see an ex. in a verse cited voce سَوْفَ, last
sentence. (TA.) التَّسْوِيفُ is [also expl. as] Syn. with
التَّأْخِيرُ [app. as meaning the postponing, putting
off, delaying, or deferring, anything]. (TA.)
[And it is implied in art. عظب of the TA that it
is Syn. with التَّمْرِينُ and التَّصْبِيرُ: so that you say,
سوّفهُ عَلَيْهِ, meaning He inured, or accustomed,
him to it; and made him to endure it with
patience: see سَافَ عَلَيْهِ, above.] ―
-b2-  You say
also, سَوَّفْتُهُ أَمْرِى, meaning I made him (a man)
to have the ordering and deciding of my affair,
or case, (S, K,) to do what he would: (S:) and
so سَوَّمْتُهُ. (TA.)
-A2-  See also 1, first sentence.

ساوفهُ: see 1:
-A2-  and 2.
-A3-  Also i. q. سَارَّهُ
[He spoke, or discoursed, secretly to him or with
him; or acquainted him with a secret]. (K.) ―

اساف, (S, M, K,) inf. n. إِسَافَةٌ, (TA,) said
of a man, (S, M,) His cattle perished, or died:
(S, K:) or he had murrain occurring among his
cattle: so in a verse of Tufeyl, cited voce اِسْتَرْخَى,
in art. رخو. (M.) [Hence,] one says, أَسَافَ حتّّى
مَايَشْتَكِى السَّوَافَ, (AA, S, Meyd, K,) or السُّوَافَ,
(As, Meyd,) [He had murrain among his cattle
until he did not complain of the murrain:] a
prov., (Meyd,) applied to him who has become
accustomed to casualties; (S, K;) or to him who
has become inured to calamities, (A'Obeyd,
Meyd, A,) so that he is not impatient of the
vicissitudes of fortune. (A'Obeyd, Meyd.) ―
-b2-
اساف الوَالِدَانِ The two parents lost their child by
his death: in which case, the child is said to be
↓ مُسَافٌ; and his father, ↓ مُسِيفٌ; and his mother,
↓ مِسْيَافٌ. (Ibn-'Abbád, K.)
-A2-  اسافهُ اللّٰهُ God destroyed him, or took away his life. (M.) ―
-b2-
اساف الخَرْزَ i. q. خَرَمَهُ [i. e. He spoiled the sewing
of the skin, or hide; as when one uses a thick
instrument for sewing or perforating, and a thin
thong; or as when one rends two stitch-holes into
one]. (M.) And اساف الخَارِزُ The sewer of a
skin, or hide, perforated, or sewed, in such a
manner that the two stitch-holes became rent [into
one]. (A'Obeyd, K.)

إِسْتَوَفَ see 1, first and second sentences.
سَافٌ Any row, or course, (S, M, L, K, TA,)
[i. e.] a single row, or course, (Mgh,) of bricks,
(S, M, Mgh, L, K, TA,) or (so in the Mgh, but
in the TA “ and ”) of clay, (Mgh, TA,) of a
wall, (S, Mgh, K, TA,) or in a wall, (TA,) or in a
building; (M, L, TA;) as also مِدْمَاكٌ: (TA:) pl.
of pauc. آسُفٌ [formed by transposition, like آدُرٌ
pl. of دَارٌ,] (L,) and سَافَاتٌ: (Mgh:) Lth explains
السَّافُ as signifying what is between the سَافَات of
the building: its ا is originally و. (TA.) [سَافَةٌ
mentioned by Freytag as signifying “ a single
series of stones in a wall,” on the authority of the
K, I do not find there, nor in any other lexicon.]
-A2-  Also A certain bird, that preys. (M.)
سَوْفَ, for which one also says سَفْ, (M, Mughnee, K,) rejecting the medial radical letter, (M,
Mughnee,) and سَوْ, (M, Mughnee, K,) rejecting
the final radical, (M, Mughnee,) and سَىْ, (M,
Mughnee, K,) rejecting the final radical and
changing the medial into ى for the purpose of
alleviation [of the utterance], (M, Mughnee,) and
accord. to the L سَا, (TA,) is a particle, (IJ, M,
K,) denoting inception; (K;) or a word denoting
تَنْفِيس, (Sb, S, M, K,) i. e. amplification, because
it changes the aor. from the strait time, which is
the present, to the ample time, which is the future;
(Mughnee voce سَ [q. v.];) i. e., denoting تنفيس
with respect to that which has not yet happened;
(Sb, S, K;) and postponement; (M;) and is used
in terrifying and threatening and promising;
(IDrd, K;) or it is a word denoting promising or
threatening: (Msb:) it is syn. with سَ accord. to
some, or has a larger meaning than this latter
accord. to others. (Mughnee.) You say, سَوْفَ
أَفْعَلُ [I will do such a thing]. (Sb, S.) And one
may not introduce a separating word between it
and its verb, [except in a case mentioned in what
follows,] because it occupies the place of the س
in سَيَفْعَلُ [&c.]. (Sb, S.) [But] it is distinct from
سَ by its [sometimes] having ل prefixed to it;
as in [the phrase in the Kur xciii. 5], وَلَسَوْفَ يُعْطِيكَ
رَبُّكَ فَتَرْضَى [And thy Lord will give thee, and
thou wilt be well pleased]: (Mughnee:) in this
phrase, [however,] the ل is [considered as] pre-
fixed to the verb, not to the particle: (M:) or the
phrase is elliptical, for لَأَنْتَ سَوْفَ يُعْطِيكَ. (Bd.)
And it is distinct from سَ in this, that it is sometimes separated [from its verb] by a verb divested
of government both as to the letter and the meaning; as in the saying,
وَمَا أَدْرِى وَسَوْفَ إِخَالُ أَدْرِى
أَقَوْمٌ آلُ حِصْنٍ أَمْ نِسَآءُ
[And I know not, but I shall, I think, know,
whether the family of Hisn be a company of men
or women]. (Mughnee.) ―
-b2-  When you desire to
make it a subst., [i. e. to use it as a subst.,] you
make it to have tenween [when it is indeterminate]. (IDrd, K.) IDrd cites as an ex.,
إِنَّ سَوْفًا وَإِنَّ لَيْتًا عَنَآءٌ
[Verily سَوْفَ and verily لَيْتَ are a weariness]:
but one reading is إِنَّ لَوًّا; and another, إِنَّ لَيْتًا
وإِنَّ لَوًّا; and there is no such reading as إِنَّ سَوْفًا.
(O, TA.) One says also, فُلَانٌ يَقْتَاتُ السَّوْفَ [lit.
Such a one feeds upon the word سَوْفَ]; meaning
(tropical:)  Such a one lives by means of things hoped for:
(S, K, TA:) and in like manner, مَا قُوتُهُ إِلَّا السَّوْفُ
[lit. His food is not anything but, or other than,
the word سَوْفَ]. (A, TA.) ―
-b3-  In the following
verse of Ibn-Mukbil, cited by Sb,
بِسَوْفٍ مِنْ تَحِيَّتِهَا ↓ لَوْ سَاوَفَتْنَا
سَوْفَ العَيُوفِ لَرَاحَ الرَّكْبُ قَدْ قَنِعَا
[Had she put us off with a سَوْفَ as part of her
greeting, with the putting off even of such as is
affected with dislike, the riders had gone contented], سَوْفَ is put in the accus. case [for مُسَاوَفَةَ,
i. e.] as an inf. n. with the augmentation [meaning
the augmentative letters] rejected. (M.)
سِيفَةٌ: see مَسَافَةٌ, in two places.
سَوَافٌ The [cucumber commonly called] قِثَّآء
[q. v.]: (M, K, TA:) so says AHn, (M, TA,) on
the authority of Et-Toosee. (TA.)
-A2-  See also
what next follows.
سُوَافٌ and ↓ سَوَافٌ; with damm accord. to As,
and so, he says, all the names of diseases, as نُحَازٌ
and دُكَاعٌ and قُلَابٌ and خُمَالٌ [&c.]; accord. to
AA, not so, but with fet-h, and in like manner
said 'Omárah Ibn-'Akeel; (S;) or none relates
it with fet-h except AA, and his relation is
nought; (IB;) Disease of cattle, and death
thereof: (S:) or each signifies death among mankind and cattle: (M:) or the latter, a mortality,
or murrain, among camels; or so the former: or
the latter, a mortality among mankind and
cattle: (K:) and the former, disease of camels;
(AHn, M, K;) and so the latter. (K.) One says,
وَقَعَ فِى المَالِ سَوَافٌ [or سُوَافٌ] Death [or a murrain] happened among the cattle. (S.)
مَسَافٌ The nose: because one smells (يُسَافُ, K,
i. e. يُشَمُّ, TA) with it: (K:) so in the Moheet.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  See also مَسَافَةٌ, in two places.
مُسَافٌ A child taken from his parents by death:
see 4. (Ibn-'Abbád, K.)
مُسِيفَ A man whose cattle have died. (TA.)
―
-b2-  And A father having lost his child by death:
see 4. (Ibn-'Abbád, K.)
مَسَافَةٌ [properly A place of smelling: ―
-b2-  and
hence,] (tropical:)  Distance; (S, K, TA;) and ↓ مَسَافٌ and
↓ سِيفَةٌ signify the same in this sense [or in others
here following]: (K:) [a space, or tract, or an
extent, over which one journeys:] a far-extending
tract that one traverses: originally a place of
smelling of the guides, in order that they may
know whether it be far or near, out of the way or
in the right way: (A, TA:) or a [desert, or such
as is termed] مَفَازَة: (M:) said to be from سَافَ
الشَّىْءَ meaning “ he smelled the thing; ” for the
guide smells the dust of the place wherein he is;
and if he smell the odour of urine and dung of
camels, he knows that he [or some other] has
traversed it; but otherwise, not: (Msb:) or because the guide, when he is in a desert, (S, M, K,)
and has lost his way therein, (M,) smells its
dust, (S, M, K,) in order that he may know, (S,
K,) or and thus knows, (M,) whether he be in
the right way, (S, M, K,) or not: (S, K:) then,
by reason of frequency of usage of this word [as
meaning “ a place of smelling of the guides ”] it
became a term for “ distance: ” (S, K:) pl. مَسَاوِفُ
(A, TA) and مَسَافَاتٌ. (Msb.) One says, كَمْ
مَسَافَةُ هٰذِهِ الأَرْضِ and ↓ مَسَافُهَا and ↓ سِيفَتُهَا (tropical:)  [How
long is the distance, or how much is the extent, of
this land?]. (TA.) And بَيْنَهُمْ مَسَافَةٌ بَعِيدَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  [Between them is a far-extending distance or space].
(Msb.) And بَيْنَنَا مَسَافَةُ عِشْرِينَ يَوْمًا (tropical:)  [Between
us is the distance, or space, of twenty days].
(TA.) ―
-b3-  In the following saying of Dhu-rRummeh, it is doubly tropical:
وَأَبْعَدُهُمْ مَسَافَةَ غَوْرِ عَقْلٍ
إِذَا مَا الأَمْرُ ذُو الشُّبُهَاتِ عَالَا
(tropical:)  (tropical:)  [And the furthest of them in the extent of the
depth of intelligence when the affair, or case, in
which are dubiousnesses overcomes and is onerous].
(A, TA.)
مُسَوِّفٌ One who does what he will, [as though
he said time after time سَوْفَ أَفْعَلُ,] whom no one
will make to turn back. (K.) ―
-b2-  And, with ة, A
woman who will not comply with the desire of her
husband when he calls her to his bed, and strives
with him to repel him in respect of that which he
desires of her, and says سَوْفَ أَفْعَلُ: such is said,
in a trad., to be cursed. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Also, with ة,
A well (رَكِيَّةٌ) of which one says, Water will be
found (سَوْفَ يُوجَدُ) in it: or of which the water
is smelt (يُسَافُ), and disliked, and loathed. (Ibn-
'Abbád, Z, K.) ―
-b4-  And, without ة, Very patient
or enduring. (TA.)
مُسْتَافٌ A place of smelling, or that is smelt.
(O, K.)
مِسْيَافٌ A mother having lost her child by
death: see 4. (Ibn-'Abbád, K.)
إِنَّهَا لَمُسَاوِفَةٌ لِلسَّيْرِ [app. referring to a she-camel]
Verily she is one that has ability for journeying.
(M.)
