سَآهُ, (S, M, K,) like رَمَاهُ, [or rather like
دَعَاهُ,] incorrectly [and differently] written in
copies of the K, (TA,) i. q. سَآءَهُ, (S, M, K, TA,)
formed from the latter by transposition; (S, M;)
mentioned by Sb: you say, سَآهُ الأَمْرُ, like سَآءَهُ
[The affair displeased, grieved, or vexed, him]:
(M:) and سَأَوْتُهُ, meaning سُؤْتُهْ [I displeased,
grieved, or vexed, him]. (S, TA.) ―
-b2-  And سَأَا
بَيْنَهُمْ, (K, TA,) inf. n. سَأْوْ, (TA,) He created,

أَسْأَيْتُ القَوْسَ I made a سِئَة [q. v.] to the
bow. (K, TA.)
سَأَةٌ: see what next follows.
سُؤَةٌ: see what next follows.
سِئَةٌ of a bow, and ↓ سُؤَةٌ, (Ibn-Málik, Az, ISd,
K, TA,) and ↓ سَأَةٌ, (Ibn-Málik, K, TA,) [in the
CK erroneously written ساءَة, and it is there implied that the other vars. are سِيْئَةٌ and سُوْءَةٌ,]
dial. vars. of سِيَةٌ, (K, &c.,) i. e. The curved
extremity thereof. (TA.) [See also art. سيو.]
مَسْآةٌ, like مَسْعَاةٌ, is a dial. var. of مَسَآءَةٌ, [or]
formed from the latter by transposition; and has
for its pl. مَسَآءٍ: whence the saying, أَكْرَهُ مَسَائِيَكَ
[I dislike, or hate, thy vices, faults, or acts of
disobedience]: (TA:) Sb mentions this saying;
(M, TA;) and says, مَسَآءَةٌ is pluralized, and then
the pl. is transformed, so that it is as though it
were pl. of مَسْآةٌ, like مَسْعَاةٌ. (M.)
