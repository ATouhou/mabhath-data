سقمونياسَقْمُونِيَا, (so in copies of the K,) or سَقَمُونِيَآءُ,
(Mgh, Msb,) said to be an ancient Greek word,
[*skammwhi/a] or, as some say, (Msb,) Syriac,
(Mgh, Msb,) [Seammony;] a certain plant,
from the hollows of which is extracted a mucilage,
which is dried, and is called by the name of its
plant: it is more repugnant to the stomach and
the bowels than all the laxatives; but it is rendered good by aromatic substances, such as pepper
and ginger and aniseed: the weight of six barleycorns thereof to twenty eases the yellow bile, and
noxious viscosities, from the most remote parts of
the body; and a portion thereof with a portion
of تُرْبُد, or تِربَد, [so in different copies of the K,
or تُرْبَذ, or تِرْبَذ, i. e. turpeth,] in fresh milk,
taken fasting, will not leave a single worm in the
belly: it is wonderful in that effect, and proved
by experiment. (K.)
