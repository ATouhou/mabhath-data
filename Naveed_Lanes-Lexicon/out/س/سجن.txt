عَنَآءً وَ حَمِّلْهُ المَهَارَى النَّوَاجِيَا

-b2-  [In the Kur lxxxiii. 7,]
A certain place in which is the record [of the
deeds] of the wicked; (S, L, K;) or, as I 'Ab
says, in which are their registers: AO says, it is
of the measure فِعِّيلٌ from السِّجْنُ, like الفِسِّيقُ
from الفِسْقُ: (S, L:) or a certain valley in Hell:
or a certain stone, [or rock,] (L, K,) beneath,
(L,) or in, (K,) the seventh earth: (L, K:)
[these explanations are given by those who hold
that مَا سِجِّينٌ in the next verse is for مَا كِتَابُ
سِجِّينٍ:] or it there means a register comprising
the deeds of the wicked, (Bd, Jel, *) of the jinn,
or genii, and of mankind, (Bd,) or of the devils
and the unbelievers: (Jel:) or ما سجّين in the
next verse is for ما كتاب سجّين, and the meaning is the place, (Bd, Jel,) which is beneath the
seventh earth, the abode of Iblees and his forces:
(Jel:) IAth says, it occurs in a trad. with the
article ال; and without that article it is a proper
name for the fire [of Hell], and hence the mention of it in the Kur lxxxiii. 7. (L.) [See also
سِجِّيلٌ.]
-A2-  Also Anything hard: (L:) and hard,
vehement, or severe; (S, L, K;) applied to a
beating. (S, L.) ―
-b2-  And Continuing, lasting, or
everlasting; syn. دَائِمٌ; (L, K;) as also سِجِّيلٌ:
so accord. to El-Muärrij. (L. [See, again,
سِجِّيلٌ.])
-A3-  And i. q. عَلَانِيَة: (L, K:) so in the
saying, عَمِلَ ذٰلِكَ سِجِّينًا [He did that openly,
or publicly]. (L.)
-A4-  Also Palm-trees (نَخْل)
such as are termed سِلْتِين (As, L, K) in the dial.
of the people of El-Bahreyn; (As, L;) [app.
meaning that the latter word is of that dial.; for
it is said that] the Arabs [app. the Arabs in
general] say سِجِّين in the place of سِلْتِين, which
is not Arabic: (L:) the palm-trees thus termed
are such as have trenches dug at their feet to
conduct the water to them when it has not reached
to them. (L, and K in art. سلتن.)
سَاجُونٌ Iron such as is termed أَنِيث [i. e.
female, meaning soft]. (L.)
[
مَسْجَنَةٌ, accord. to Freytag, The act of imprisoning: but it seems rather to be a word of the
class of مَبْخَلَةٌ and مَجْبَنَةٌ &c., and to signify a
cause of imprisonment.]
مَسْجُونٌ: see سَجِينٌ.
