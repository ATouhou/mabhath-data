سمدعسَمَيْدَعٌ, (S, K, &c.,) of the measure فَعَيْلَلٌ, (Sb,
TA,) so accord. to the grammarians, but Aboo-Usámeh Junádeh El-Azdee says that it is of the
measure فَمَيْعَلٌ, from سَدْعٌ as syn. with ذَبْحٌ and
بَسْطٌ, (Sgh, TA,) pronounced by the vulgar سُمَيْدَع,
with damm to the س, (IDrst, TA,) which is a
mistake, (Th, IDrst, S, K, &c.,) for there is not
in the language of the Arabs a noun of the
measure فُعَيْلَلٌ, (IDrst, TA,) A lord, master, chief,
prince, or man of rank or quality; ('Eyn, S, O,
K;) to which Et-Teiyánee adds, from As, on the
authority of Munteji' Ibn-Nebhán, (TA,) of easy
nature or disposition, generous, and very hospitable, or in whose vicinity his companion has power
or authority or dignity, not being harmed nor
inconvenienced; (S, K, TA;) and thus expl. by
AHát also; (TA;) generous; noble, or elevated
in rank; liberal, bountiful, or munificent: (O,
K:) and also (K) courageous: (Lth, K:) and
goodly, and stout, bulky, or corpulent: (AZ, EtTeiyánee:) pl. سَمَادِعُ. (IJ.) ―
-b2-  The lion. (Ibn-Ed-Dahhán, T, S, O.) ―
-b3-  And hence, [accord. to
SM, but the reverse I think more probable,] (tropical:)  A
chief, or person of authority. (TA.) ―
-b4-  The
wolf; (En-Nadr, K;) because of his swiftness.
(En-Nadr.) ―
-b5-  And hence, (TA,) (tropical:)  A man active,
agile, or prompt, in accomplishing his wants.
(K, TA.) ―
-b6-  And A sword. (K.)
