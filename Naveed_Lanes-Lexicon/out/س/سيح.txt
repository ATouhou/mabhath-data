سَاحَ, (S, Mgh, K,) or سَاحَ عَلَى وَجْهِ الأَرْضِ,
(A,) aor. يَسِيحُ, (S, K,) inf. n. سَيْحٌ (S, A, Mgh,
K) and سَيَحَانٌ, (K,) It (water) ran upon the
surface of the earth. (S, A, Mgh, K.) ―

(Msb,) or both, and سُيُوحٌ and سَيَحَانٌ, (S, K,)
said of a man, (A,) (tropical:)  He went, or journeyed,
through the land, or earth, (S, L, K, &c.,) for
the purpose of devoting himself to religious services or exercises: (L, K:) or in this restricted
sense, which MF asserts to be unmentioned in
most of the older books, and thinks to be conventional, the verb has only the first of the
inf. ns. above, and in the absolute sense it has
the second and third and fourth. (TA.) It is
said in a trad., لَا سِيَاحَةَ فِى الإِسْلَامِ (S, A, TA)
i. e. (tropical:)  [There shall be no going about through the
land, or earth, in the way of devotees, in ElIslám: or] no quitting of the cities, or towns,
and going, or journeying, through the land, or
earth: (TA:) or no quitting of the cities, or
towns, and dwelling in the deserts, and forsaking

or moved, from side to side, or from place to
place. (S, K.)

سَيَّحَ [سيّح is said by Golius, as on the authority
of the K, to signify He made water to flow: and
this is probably its primary and proper signification, whence other meanings, which are tropical:
but it is not in the K.] ―
-b2-  See 4. ―
-b3-  سيّح فُلَانٌ,
[app. for سيّح كَلَامَهُ,] inf. n. تَسْيِيحٌ, (tropical:)  Such a

-b2-  اساح
الفَرَسُ جُرْدَانَهُ (A) or ذَكَرَهُ (L) (tropical:)  The horse put
forth his veretrum from its prepuce; (L;) and
↓ سيّح signifies the same: (A, L:) or both of

[q. v.]. (TA in art. رفض.) ―
-b3-  And اساح بِذَنَبِهِ,
said of a horse, (assumed tropical:)  He let his tail hang down
loosely: (K:) accord. to the K, J is in error in
writing this verb اشاح; and Az says that اساح is
right, and that اشاح is a mistranscription: the
like is also said in the TS: but اشاح is asserted
by more than one to be the right word. (TA.)

انساح بَطْنُهُ (assumed tropical:)  His belly became large (K,
TA) and wide, (TA,) and approached [the

belly became big, and approached the ground.
(IAar, T.) ―
-b2-  انساح بَالُهُ (tropical:)  [His, or its, state, or
condition,] became free from straitness, or unstraitened. (S, O, K.) A poet says, (S,) namely,
Dhu-r-Rummeh, (O,)

And it is said in the trad. relating to the cave
(الغَار [mentioned in the Kur ix. 40]) فَانْسَاحَتِ
الصَّخْرَةُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  [And the mass of rock] became
impelled and riven: and hence, [accord. to some,]
the ↓ سَاحَة of a house [expl. in art. سوح]: but as
some relate it, the verb in this instance is
[انصاخت,] with ص and خ. (TA.)
سَيْحٌ Running water; (S, Msb;) an inf. n. used

(K:) or external water running upon the surface
of the earth: (T, TA:) the water of rivers and

former أَسْيَاحٌ. (TA.) ―

the land or earth. (A.) ―
-b3-  And, as being likened
thereto, (tropical:)  Fasting, or a faster: (A:) or a faster
who keeps to the mosques: (K:) the faster is said
to be thus called because he who journeys as a
devotee does so without having any provision
with him, and eats only when he finds provision:
therefore the faster is likened to him. (TA.)
السَّائِحُونَ in the Kur ix. 113 means (tropical:)  The fasters:
(Bd, Jel, TA:) so say Zj and I'Ab and Ibn-Mes'ood: (TA:) or those who observe the obligatory fasts: or those who fast constantly: (TA:)

mistranscription for سَابِحَات]) also means (assumed tropical:)  Swift
horses: ―
-b5-  and (assumed tropical:)  The planets. (KL.)
مَسَاحٌ or مَسَاحَةٌ, the latter of the measure
مَفْعَلَةٌ, from السِّيَاحَةُ, [each app. meaning (assumed tropical:)  A
place of سِيَاحَة, or journeying,] is sing. of مَسَايِحُ,
in which the ى is like that in مَعَايِشُ, as in other
similar words of which the medial radical is an
infirm letter, except مَصَائِبُ, by rule مَصَاوِبُ.
(Har p. 15.) ―
-b2-  [The pl. مَسَايِحُ is also expl. by
Freytag as applied in the Deewán of Jereer to
(assumed tropical:)  The part of the head between the temples as far
as the forehead (where the hairs are).]
مُسَيَّحٌ (assumed tropical:)  Striped; applied in this sense to a
[garment of the kind called] بُرْد; (S, K;) and
also, with ة, to a [garment such as is called]
عَبَآءَة: (S:) or applied to [the garments called]
عَبَآء as meaning having alternate stripes of white
and black, the latter not intensely black: every
عباءة also is termed ↓ سَيْحٌ and مُسَيَّحَةٌ: but that
which has not stripes is a كِسَآء, not an عباءة.
(ISh, TA.) So too applied to locusts (جَرَاد);
(K;) and with ة applied to a single locust [i. e.
جَرَادَة]: (TA:) or, applied to locusts, it means

apparent: (K, TA:) likened to the عَبَآء thus
termed. (TA.)
مِسْيَاحٌ (tropical:)  One who goes about calumniating, and
making mischief, in the land: (S, A, K:) pl.
مَسَايِيحُ: so in the trad., لَيْسُوا بِالمَسَايِيحِ وَلَا
بِالمَذَايِيعِ البُذُرِ (tropical:)  [They are not of those who go
about calumniating, &c., nor of the babblers who
cannot keep secrets.] (S, TA.) Sh derives it, not
from السِّيَاحَةُ, but, from تَسْيِيحُ الثَّوْبِ. (L, TA.)
