سفح1
سَفَحَ, (S, A, Msb, K,) aor.
سَفَحَ, (Msb, K,)
inf. n. سَفْحٌ, (Msb,) [and app. سُفُوحٌ also, mentioned in what follows,] He poured out, or forth,
water: (S, A:) and he shed blood, (S, A, Msb,
K,) the blood of another; (S, A;) and tears;
(Msb, K;) inf. n. as above, and سُفُوحٌ: (K:) or
سَفَحَتِ العَيْنُ دَمْعَهَا [the eye shed its tears]. (A.)
The saying, in a trad., فَقَتَلَ عَلَىرَأْسِ المَآءِ حَتَّى
سَفَحَ الدَّمُ المَآءَ has been explained as meaning [And
he slew at the head of the water so that] the blood
covered the water: but IAth says that this is not
consistent with the language; for سَفْحٌ signifies
the act of “ pouring out, or forth; ” and that the
meaning may therefore be, that the blood made
the water to pour forth; like as when, into a
full vessel, something heavier than what is in it
is poured; for in this case there comes forth from
it as much as has been poured into it. (TA.) ―
