بِفُلَانٍ, (S, M, Msb, K,)
accord. to Sb originally with ب, but Lh says that

فُلَانًا ↓ سَمَاهُ and بِفُلَانٍ, (K, [in the correct copies
of which the form of the verb first mentioned is
without teshdeed, while in the CK the first and
last are both alike with teshdeed, or, as is said in
the M, Th has mentioned سَمَوْتُهُ, but none other

meaning He pronounced the name of God, saying بِسْمِ اللّٰهِ (In the name of God), upon, or over,
a thing; such as food, and an animal about to be

دنو and سمت,] meaning سَمُّوا اللّٰهَ [Pronounce
ye the name of God, &c.]; i. e. whenever ye eat,

said in the trad. respecting the lie [against
'Áïsheh], لَمْ تَكُنِ امْرَأَةٌ تُسَامِيهَا غَيْرُ زَيْنَبَ, meaning
There was not any woman that vied with her

المُسَامَاةُ meaning المُطَاوَلَةُ فِى الحُِظْوَةِ. (TA.) And
one says, فُلَانٌ لَا يُسَامَى وَقَدْ عَلَا مَنْ سَامَاهُ [Such a
one will not be vied with in highness, &c.: and he
has overcome him who vied with him, &c.]. (S.)
And إِنَّ أَمَامِى مَا لَا أُسَامِى, said when one fears
an affair, or event, before him; on the authority
of IAar; meaning [Verily before me is an affair,

cited by Th says,
بَاتَ ابْنُ أَدْمَآءَ يُسَامِى الأَنْدَرَا
سَامَى طَعَامَ الحَىِّ حَتَّى نَوَّرَا
and he says that سَامَى means اِرْتَفَعَ, and صَعِدَ;
but [it seems that the verse should be rendered,
Ibn-Admà passed the night aspiring to reach the
heap of reaped wheat: he aspired to attain the
wheat of the tribe until it attained to maturity:
for ISd says,] in my opinion he means, as the
seed-produce rose by growth, he rose to it, until
it attained to maturity, when he reaped it and
stole it: and he cites also the saying,
فَارْفَعْ يَدَيْكَ ثُمَّ سَامِ الحَنْجَرَا
[And raise thy hands, then endeavour to reach
the windpipe]; explaining سَامِ الحَنْجَرَ as meaning raise thy hands to his حَلْق [or throat, properly, fauces]. (M.)

that purpose, (M, K, *) i. e. for the hunting of
gazelles at midday. (TA.) And استمى, (M, CK,)

in the TA,) He sought, or pursued, the gazelles
in their caves, or hiding-places, (فَى غِيرَانِهَا, M,
and so in copies of the K, by the غِيرَان being
meant the كُنُس, M,) or in what was not their
time, or season, (فِى غَيْرِ انِهَا, thus in some copies
of the K,) at the auroral rising of Canopus
(سُهَيْل [which rose aurorally, in Central Arabia,
about the commencement of the era of the Flight,
on the 4th of August, O. S.]): (M, K:) so says
IAar. (M.) [Freytag says, on the authority of
scholia to the Deewán of Jereer, as follows: In
the time of the greatest heat, they drive out a
wild animal repeatedly from its hiding-place,
permitting it to return thither at night, when,
thus disturbed, it does not issue from its place;
in order that they may be able to strike it.] ―

And He hunted, or chased, wild animals. (M.)

البَكْرَةُ مِنَ الإِبِلِ تُسْتَمَى بَعْدَ أَرْبَعَ عَشْرَةَ لَيْلَةً أَوْبَعْدَ
إِحْدَى وَعِشْرِينَ, as meaning [The youthful she-camel] is tested for the purpose of discovering
whether or not she be pregnant [after fourteen
nights or after one and twenty]: but Th disallows this, and says that the word is تُسْتَمْنَى,
from المُنْيَةُ, which means “ the period by the end
of which one knows whether or not the she-camel
is pregnant. ” (M.)

(M.) ―
-b2-  [In its predominant acceptation,] a word
of well-known meaning; (K, TA;) i. e. (TA)
[The sky, or heaven;] the canopy of the earth:
(M, Msb, TA:) in this sense (M, Msb) masc.
and fem.; (IAmb, S, M, Msb, K; *) sometimes
fem.; (M;) rarely so, and thus as having the
next but one of the significations here following:
(Fr, Msb:) Az says that it is fem. because it is
pl. [or coll. gen. n.] of سَمَآءَةٌ: (TA:) or it is as
though it were pl. of ↓ سَمَاوَةٌ, [or rather its coll.
gen. n.,] like as سَحَابٌ is of سَحَابَةٌ: (Msb, TA:)
Er-Rághib says that the سَمَآء as opposed to the
أَرْض is fem., and sometimes masc.; and is used
as a sing. and as a pl.; as the latter in the
Kur ii. 27 [where it is shown to apply to seven
heavens]; and that it is like نَخْلٌ and شَجَرٌ and
other [coll.] gen. ns.: (TA:) in this sense (M)
the pl. is أَسْمِيَةٌ [a pl. of pauc.] (S, M, K) and
سُمِىٌّ, (M, K,) the latter [originally سُمُوىٌ] of
the measure فُعُولٌ, and both [also] pls. of سَمَآءٌ in
another sense, mentioned in what follows, (TA,)
and سَمَاوَاتٌ or سَمٰوَاتٌ, (S, M, Msb, K,) and
accord. to the K, [in which all of these are mentioned as though pls. of سَمَآءٌ in all its senses,]
↓ سَمًا, [in the CK سُمًا,] but in the M سَمَآءٌ [like
the sing., as mentioned above], where it is said
that it must be a pl. in the Kur ii. 27 for the
reason already stated, as though pl. of سَمَآءَةٌ or
سَمَاوَةٌ; (TA;) and a poet assigns to سَمَآءٌ the
anomalous pl. سَمَآءٍ, by his saying,
سَمَآءُ الْإِلٰهِ فَوْقَ سَبْعِ سَمَآئِيَا
[The heaven of God, above seven heavens]: (S,
M:) the dim. is ↓ سُمّيَّةٌ. (Ham p. 452.) ―
-b3-  And
Any canopy, or covering over-head, of a person.
(S, Msb, * TA.) ―
-b4-  And hence, (S, TA,) The
ceiling, or roof, (S, Msb, K, TA,) of a house, or
chamber, or tent, (S, K, TA,) and of anything;
(K, TA;) in this sense masc.; (Msb, TA;) and
↓ سَمَاوَةٌ also has this meaning. (S.) ―
-b5-  And The
رِوَاق, (M, K,) i. e. the شُقَّة [or oblong piece of
cloth] that is beneath the upper, or uppermost,
شُقَّةٌ, (M,) of a بَيْت [or tent]; (M, K;) in which
sense it is fem., and sometimes masc.; (M;) as
also ↓ سَمَاوَةٌ; (M, K;) [and so, app., ↓ سِمَايَةٌ;
for] one says, أَصْلَحَ سِمَايَتَهُ, with kesr, [He repaired his سماية,] meaning, his سَمَاوَة. (TA.)
―
-b6-  And The clouds; (Zj, K;) because of their
height: (Zj, TA:) or a cloud. (Msb.) ―
-b7-  And
Rain; (S, M, Msb, K;) because it comes forth
from the سَمَآء [i. e. sky or clouds]: (TA:) or a
good rain (مَطْرَةٌ جَيِّدَةٌ): (K, TA:) or a new
rain (مَطْرَةٌ جَدِيدَةٌ): (T, TA:) or, as some say,
rain that has not fallen upon the earth; so called
in consideration of what has been said above [of
its meaning the “ clouds ” &c.]: (Er-Rághib,
TA:) [but] one says, مَا زِلْنَا نَطَأُ السَّمَآءَ حَتَّى
أَتَيْنَاكُمْ [We ceased not to tread upon the rain
until we came to you]: (S, TA:) applied to rain,
it is masc., and fem. also because of its connexion
with the سَمَآء that canopies the earth; (M;) or
it is fem., as meaning سَحَابَةٌ: (Msb:) the pl. [of
mult.] is سُمِىٌّ (S, M, Msb, TA) and [of pauc.]
أَسْمِيَةٌ. (S, TA.) بَنُو مَآءِ السَّمَآءِ is an appellation
of The Arabs; [signifying the sons of the water
of the heaven;] because of their keeping much to
the deserts which are the places of the falling of
rain [by means of which they subsist]: or by
مَآء السمآء is meant Zemzem, which God made to
well forth for the Arabs, who are therefore like
the sons thereof. (TA.) ―
-b8-  [Hence, app., as
being likened to rain by reason of the swiftness
of his running,] a certain horse, (M, K,) belonging to Sakhr the brother of El-Khansà, (M,) was
named السَّمَآءُ. (M, K.) ―
-b9-  [Hence, likewise, as
being likened to rain, (assumed tropical:)  Bounty.] One says,
أَصَابَنِى بِرَشْحَةٍ مِنْ سَمَائِهِ (assumed tropical:)  [He gave me a gift
from his store of bounty]. (A in art. رشح.) ―
-b10-
Also (assumed tropical:)  Herbage; because produced by the rain,
which is thus called. (TA.) ―

―
-b3-  A like, or an equal: (S, M, K TA:) and this

latter mentioned by Ks. (M, TA.) El-'Ajjáj
says,

[The form, &c., of the moon when near the change,
until it became curved]. (S.)
سِمَايَةٌ: see سَمَآءٌ, in the middle of the paragraph.

سَامٍ [High, or lofty; as also ↓ سَمِىٌّ: pl. of the
former سَوَامٍ; applied to women as pl. of سَامِيَةٌ,
whence the phrase سَوَامِى الطَّرْفِ in a verse cited
voce بُضْعٌ; and to irrational animals, as in an
instance here following]. One says القُرُومُ السَّوَامِى
The stallions [meaning the stallion-camels high in
their heads, or] raising their heads high. (S,
TA.) And سَامِيَاتٌ, [pl. of سَامِيَةٌ,] applied to

expressed in the explanation) or a similar word
being understood; i. e. (assumed tropical:)  I repelled the pride, or

it is the sing., (M,) signifies Hunters (S, M, K)
going forth to the chase: (K:) an epithet in
which the quality of a subst. predominates: or,
as some say, hunters in the day-time, peculiarly:
or hunters wearing the socks, or stockings, called
مِسْمَاة. (M.)
اِسْمٌ, (S, M, Msb, K,) with the conjunctive ا,
[i. e. written اسْمٌ,] but this is made disjunctive by
poetic license [as well as when the word commences a sentence], (S,) usually with kesr [when
the | is disjunctive], (Lh, M, TA,) and اُسْمٌ, (S,
M, K,) of the dial. of Benoo-'Amr-Ibn-Temeem
and of Kudá'ah, (M, TA,) mentioned by IAar,
(TA,) and ↓ سِمٌ and ↓ سُمٌ (S, M, K) and ↓ سَمٌ,
(K,) and ↓ سُمًا (M, K) and ↓ سِمًا and ↓ سَمًا, (K,)
[The name of a thing; i. e.] a sign [such as may
be uttered or written] conveying knowledge of a
thing; syn. عَلَامَةٌ: and a word applied to denote
a substance or an accident or attribute, for the
purpose of distinction: (M, K:) [or a substantive in the proper sense of this term, i. e. a real
substantive; and a substance in a tropical sense
of this term, i. e. an ideal substantive:] as expl.
by El-Munáwee, in the “ Towkeef,” the اسم is
that which denotes a meaning in itself unconnected
with any of the three times [past and present and
future]: if denoting what subsists by itself, it is
termed اِسْمُ عَيْنٍ; and if denoting what does not
subsist by itself, [i. e. an accident or attribute,]
whether existent, as العِلْمُ [i. e. knowledge], or
non-existent, as الجَهْلُ [i. e. ignorance], it is
termed اِسْمُ مَعْنًى: (TA:) the pl. is أَسْمَآءٌ [a pl.
of pauc.] and أَسْمَاوَاتٌ, (S, M, K,) the latter said
by Lh to be a pl. of اِسْمٌ, but it is rather a pl. of
أَسْمَآءٌ, for otherwise there is no way of accounting
for it, (M,) and أَسَامٍ (S, M, K) and أَسَامِىُّ (M,
K) are [likewise] pls. of أَسْمَآءٌ: (K, * TA:) the
word اسْمٌ [i. e. اِسْمٌ or اُسْمٌ] is derived from سَمَوْتُ,
(S, TA,) or from السُّمُوُّ, (Msb, Er-Rághib, TA,)
because the اسم is a means of raising into notice
the thing denoted thereby, and making it known:
(S, * Er-Rághib, TA:) it is of the measure اِفْعٌ [or
اُفْعٌ, accord. to different dialects], the last radical,
و, being wanting in it, (S, Msb, TA,) and the
hemzeh [or rather |] being prefixed by way of
compensation for it, accord to a general rule;
(Msb, TA;) for it is originally سِمْوٌ (S, Msb,
Er-Rághib, TA) or سُمْوٌ, (S, Msb, TA,) its pl.
being أَسْمَآءٌ, and its dim. being ↓ سُمَىٌّ [originally
سَمَيْوٌ]: (S, Msb, Er-Rághib, * TA:) some of the
Koofees hold that it is from الوَسْمُ, meaning
العَلَامَةُ, the و, which is the primal radical, being
rejected, and the hemzeh [or |] being substituted
for it, so that its measure is اِعْلٌ [or اُعْلٌ]; but
this is a weak opinion, for, were it so, the dim.
would be وَسَيْمٌ and the pl. would be أَوْسَامٌ. (Msb,
TA.) One says, اِسْمُ هٰذَا كَذَا [The name of this
is thus, or such a word]; and if you will you
may say, اُسْمُ هٰذا كذا; and in like manner,
↓ سِمُهُ and ↓ سُمُهُ: Lh says that اِسْمُهُ فُلَانٌ [His
name is Such a one] is the [common] phrase of
the Arabs; and he mentions اُسْمُهُ فُلَانٌ as heard
from [the tribe of] Benoo-'Amr-Ibn-Temeem:
and Ks cites, as heard from some of [the tribe of]
Benoo-Kudá'ah, the saying,
↓ بِاسْمِ الَّذِى فِى كُلِّ سُورَةٍ سُمُهْ
[In the name of Him whose name is in every
chapter of the Kur-án], and ↓ سِمُهْ as heard from
others, not of Kudá'ah. (M.) سِرْ عَلَى اسْمِ اللّٰهِ is
an elliptical phrase [for سِرْ مُعْتَمِدًا عَلَى ذِكْرِ اسْمِ
اللّٰهِ Journey thou relying upon the mention of the
name of God]. (IJ, M in art. دل: see دَلِيلٌ.)

report, or reputation, of a person: (TA:) and so

nominal proposition or phrase; as distinguished
from فِعْليَّةٌ, or verbal.]
[
اِسْمِيَّةٌ The quality of a name or noun or substantive.]
مِسْمَاةٌ The socks, or stockings, worn by a hunter,
(M, K, TA,) to protect him from the heat of the
burning ground. (TA.)

مُسَمَّى قَوْمِهِ and مُسَمَّاتِهِمْ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  He is of the
best of his people or party. (TA.)
مُسَامٍ: see سَمِىٌّ.
