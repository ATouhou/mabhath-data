سخبرسَخْبَرٌ A certain kind of trees, (S, K,) the heads
of which, when it grows tall, bend and hang
down; [a coll. gen. n.;] n. un. with ة: (TA:) it
resembles the إِذْخِر; (K;) or it is like the ثُمَام [or
panic grass], and has a [root such as is termed]
جُرْثُومَة; its branches, or twigs, are, in abundance,
like the كراث [app. كَرَاث, a certain large tree,
growing on the mountains]; and its fruits resemble brooms of reeds, or are more slender:
(AHn:) serpents make their abodes at its roots.
(TA.) It is related in a trad. of Ibn-Ez-Zubeyr,
that he said to Mo'áwiyeh, لَا تُطْرِقْ إِطْرَاقَ الأُفْعُوَانِ
فِى أُصُولِ السَّخْبَرِ [Do not thou look down upon
the ground like as does the male viper at the roots
of the sakhbar]; meaning (assumed tropical:)  do not thou affect
heedlessness of the state in which we are, or of the
affair in which we are engaged. (TA.) One
says also, رَكِبَ فُلَانٌ السَّخْبَرَ, meaning, (assumed tropical:)  Such a
one acted perfidiously, treacherously, or unfaithfully. (S.) And a poet says,
وَالغَدْرُ يَنْبُتُ فِى أُصُولِ السَّخْبَرِ
(assumed tropical:)  [And perfidy grows at the roots of the sakhbar]:
(S:) [because the viper lives there: or] the poet
means, that the people of whom he speaks dwelt
in places where the sakhbar grew; and they are
thought to have been of the tribe of Hudheyl:
IB says that he likens the perfidious to this tree
because, when it is full-grown, its head hangs
down, not remaining erect; and that he means,
ye do not remain faithful, like as this tree does
not remain in one state. (TA.)
