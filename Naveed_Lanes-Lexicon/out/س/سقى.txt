سقى1
سَقَاهُ, aor. يَسْقِيهِ, (K,) inf. n. سَقْىٌ; (TA;
[see also سِقَايَةٌ, which is likewise said to be an
inf. n. of the same verb;]) and ↓ سقّاهُ, (K,) with
teshdeed; (TA;) and ↓ اسقاهُ; (K, TA; [in the
CK, erroneously, اسْتَقاهُ;]) all have one meaning;
(TA;) [i. e. He gave him to drink, generally
water, often milk, and sometimes poison or some
other thing: and the first often signifies he
watered him, namely, a beast; and in like manner
seed produce &c., i. e. irrigated it; as will be
shown by what follows:] or سَقَاهُ [is said when
you mean he gave him drink] لِشَفَتِهِ [to his lip],
(S,) or بِالشَّفَةِ [by means of the lip], as also
↓ سقّاهُ; and ↓ اسقاهُ means he directed him to
water, (K,) or he watered (سَقَى) his cattle or
his land: (S, * K:) or both of them, (K, TA,)
i. e. سَقَاهُ and ↓ اسقاهُ, (TA,) signify he assigned
to him, or gave to him, (جَعَلَ لَهُ,) water, (K,
TA,) or drink, or water for irrigation; so that
سَقَاهُ is like كَسَاهُ, and ↓ اسقى is like آَلْبَسَ, as Sb
says: (TA:) or, as some say, سَقَيْتُهُ I gave him
water to his mouth; and ↓ أَسْقَيْتُهُ, I assigned to
him, or gave to him, (جَعَلْتُ لَهُ,) drink, or water
for irrigation, that he might do as he would;
and like them are كَسَوْتُهُ and أَكْسَيْتُهُ: (Ham
p. 45:) Er-Rághib says that السَّقْىُ signifies the
giving one drink; and ↓ الإِسْقَآءُ, the giving one
drink so that he may take it howsoever he will;
so that the latter is more ample in meaning than
the former. (TA.) Both سَقَى and ↓ اسقى are
sometimes used in relation to what is in the bellies
of camels or other cattle; [meaning their milk;]
as in the Kur [xxiii. 21], where it is said,
مِمَّا فِى بُطُونِهَا ↓ نُسْقِيكُمْ, or نَسْقِيكُمْ, [i. e. We give
you to drink of what is in their bellies,] accord.
to different readings. (TA.) One says, سَقَاهُ المَآءَ,
[He gave him to drink water, or the water,]
inf. n. as above: (Mgh:) and المَآءَ ↓ سَقَّيْتُهُ [I
gave him to drink water, or the water, much, or
often]: the teshdeed denotes muchness, or frequency. (S.) [See also a tropical usage of the
former verb in a verse cited in p. 85, col. 3: and
another, from Tarafeh, in p. 134, col. 3. One
says also, سَقَى المَآءَ, without a second objective
complement, He supplied, or gave, water, or the
water.] And سَقَيْتُ الزَّرْعَ, [I watered, or irrigated, the seed-produce,] inf. n. as above; as also
↓ أَسْقَيْتُهُ, (Msb.) And سَقَيْتُ فِى القِرْيَةِ and
فِيهَا ↓ أَسْقَيْتُ [I poured water into the water-skin]: a poet says, [in one of my copies of the S,
Dhu-r-Rummeh,]
وَمَاشَنَّتَا خَرْقَآءَ وَاهٍ كِلَاهُمَا
سَقَى فِيهِمَا مُسْتَعْجِلٌ لَمْ تَبَلَّلَا
بِأَنْبَعَ مِنْ عَيْنَيْكَ لِلدَّمْعِ كُلَّمَا
تَعَرَّفْتَ دَارًا أَوْ تَوَهَّمْتَ مَنْزِلَا
[And two old and worn-out skins of an unskilful woman who has not sewed them well,
each of them unsound, into which a person in
haste has poured water, they not having been
previously moistened, (تَبَلَّلَا being for تَتَبَلَّلَا,)
are not more liable to the shedding of their water
than are thine eyes to the shedding of tears
whenever thou investigatest a dwelling or imaginest a place of alighting, or abode]. (S.) [And
hence, app.,] سَقَى فُلَانٌ فِى ذَكَرِهِ (assumed tropical:)  Such a one
became vehemently affected by sexual appetite.
(JK.) One says also, سَقَاهُ اللّٰهُ الغَيْثَ and ↓ اسقاهُ
(S, Msb, * K) God sent down rain to him, or may
God send &c.: (K:) both of these verbs being
used by Lebeed in his saying,
سَقَى قَوْمِى بَنِى مَجْدٍ وَأَسْقَى
نُمَيْرًا وَالقَبَائِلَ مِنْ هِلَالِ
[May He send down rain to my people, the sons
of Mejd, and may He send down rain to Numeyr,
and the tribes of Hilál]. (S.) [Hence,] one
says, سَقَى اللّٰهُ عَصْرَ الشَّبِيبَةِ (assumed tropical:)  [May God freshen
as with rain the times, or mornings, or afternoons,
of youth, or young manhood]. (A and TA in art.
شب.) And سَقَيْتُ فُلَانًا, (S,) and ↓ أَسْقَيْتُهُ, and
↓ سَقَّيْتُهُ, (S, K, *) which last is the form in most
repute as expressive of a prayer, (Ham p. 45,)
and of which the inf. n. is تَسْقِيَةٌ, (K,) I said to
such a one سَقَاكَ اللّٰهُ [May God send down rain
to thee], (S and K in explanation of the second
and third,) or سَقْيًا [which virtually means the
same, for سَقَاكَ اللّٰهُ سَقْيًا]: (S in explanation of the
first and second, and K in explanation of the
second and third:) [or,] accord, to some, one
says سَقَيْتُهُ when it [which he gives, i. e. water or
the like,] is in his hand; [agreeably with the first
explanation in this art.;] and ↓ أَسْقَيْنُهُ signifies I
prayed for him, saying سَقْيًا لَكَ. (Msb.) ―
-b2-
سَقَى بَطْنُهُ, (JK, S, MA, K,) inf. n. سَقِىٌ; (JK,
S;) and سُقِىَ, (JK, IAth, TA,) or سَقِى, aor.
يَسْقَى, inf. n. سِقًى or سَقًى; (MA;) and ↓ استسقى;
(JK, S, K; [in my copy of the Msb استقى,
which I doubt not to be a mistranscription, as the
verb most commonly known in the sense here
following is استسقى, and as this is not there
mentioned;]) His belly [was, or became, diseased
with dropsy, i. e.] had yellow water [meaning
serum] (JK, S, Msb, K, * TA) apparent in it,
(JK,) or collected in it; (S, K, TA;) for which
there is scarcely, or never, any cure; (Msb,
TA;) his belly became swollen [with dropsy].
MA.) ―
-b3-  [In the phrase written in the CK
سُقِىَ قُلْبُهُ عَدَاوَةًُ, the verb is correctly سُقِىَ:
see 2.] ―
-b4-  سَقَىالعَرَقُ The sweat flowed without
stopping. (TA.) ―
-b5-  سَقَى التَّوْبَ, and ↓ سقّاهُ, He
made the garment, or piece of cloth, to imbibe a
dye. (TA.) ―
-b6-  [سَقَى also signifies He tempered
steel; and is used in this sense in the present day:
and accord. to a reading in one of my copies of
the S, in art. شرخ, ↓ سقّى also has this meaning.]

سَقَّىَ see 1, in six places. ―
-b2-  سُقِىَ قَلْبُهُ عَدَاوَةً,
(K, TA, [in the CK, erroneously, سُقِىَ,]) and
بِالعَدَاوَةِ, (TA, and thus, and thus only, in the
JK,) inf. n. تَسْقِيَةٌ, (JK, TA,) (tropical:)  His heart was
made to imbibe enmity, (K, TA,) is said of a man
to whom a thing that he dislikes, or hates, has
been repeatedly done. (TA.)

مُسَاقَاةٌ [The giving to drink, one with another.
See a tropical usage of its verb in an ex.
cited in art. شف, conj. 8. ―
-b2- ] The drawing
of water together. (KL.) ―
-b3-  And a man's employing a man to take upon himself, or manage,
the culture [or watering & c.] of palm-trees
or grape-vines [or the like] on the condition
of his having a certain share of their produce:
(S, TA:) Az says that the people of El-'Irák
term it مُعَامَلَةٌ. (TA.)
4
أَسْقَىَ see 1, in thirteen places. ―
-b2-  One says also,
أَسْقَيْتُهُ رَكِيَّتِى I assigned to him my well [to draw
water therefrom]: and أَسْقَيْتُهُ جَدْوَلًا مِنْ نَهْرِى I
assigned to him [a streamlet as] a place, or
source, of irrigation, from my river, or rivulet;
and أَسْقَيْتُ لَهُ مِنْهُ [which means the same].
(TA.) ―
-b3-  And اسقاهُ It produced in him [dropsy,
or] yellow water. (JK. [See 1, near the end of
the paragraph.]) ―
-b4-  And He gave him a made
[shin such as is termed] سِقَآء: (Az, K, TA: [it is
said in the TA that وَهَبَ مِنْهُ in the K should be
وَهَبَ لَهُ, as in the explanation by Az: but see art.
وهب, in which it is said that وهب منه is allowable, and occurs in several trads.:]) or he gave
him a hide to make of it a سِقَآء: (K:) or اسقاهُ
إِهَابًا has the latter meaning: (JK, TA:) and
أَسْقِ إِهَابَهَا occurs in a trad. as meaning Give
thou its hide to him who will make of it a سِقَآء,
(TA,) or make thou its hide to be a سِقَآء for thee.
(JK.) ―
-b5-  Also, (JK, S, K, TA,) and ↓ سَقَاهُ, (K,)
the latter mentioned as on the authority of IAar,
but disallowed by Sh, (TA,) i. q. اِغْتَابَهُ (tropical:)  [He
spoke evil of him, or traduced him, in his absence
or otherwise], (JK, S, K, TA,) in a foul manner;
(TA;) and imputed to him a vice, fault, or the
like: (S, TA:) and J cites [in the S] a verse

meaning [Thrown down upon the ground, his
skin] becomes drenched with his blood (يَتَشَرَّبُهُ)
[like as drips the severed trunk of the Theban

استقى He drew water (TA) مِن البِئْرِ [from
the well], (S, TA,) and مِنَ النَّهْرِ [from the river,
or rivulet]. (TA. [Golius and Freytag make
the verb in this sense, erroneously, استسقى; but
the former mentions استقِىِ also in the same
sense.]) [And استقى عَلَى بَعِيرٍ He drew water
upon a camel in a manner expl. voce سَانِيَةٌ, q. v.:

TA); منْهُ [from him]; as also ↓ استقى. (K,
TA. [In the CK is immediately added after this
explanation, وسَقِيًّا: but this is a mistranscription
for وَتَقَيَّأَ; expressing another signification of these
two verbs, which will be expl. below.]) And He
asked, begged, or prayed, for rain; (Msb, * TA;)
i. q. اِسْتَمْطَرَ (S in art. مطر, and Msb. *) [Hence,
صَلَاةُ الاِسْتِسْقَآءِ The prayer of the petitioning for
rain. And استسقى لَهَا He said سَقَاهَااللّٰهُ May
God send down rain upon it, namely, a land:
see Har p. 300.] ―
-b2-  And He constrained himself to vomit; or vomited intentionally; syn.
تَقَيَّأَ; [see a statement above, in this paragraph,

―
-b3-  See also 1, in the last quarter of the paragraph.
سَقْى in the phrase سَقْىُ الفُرَاتِ, which means
The towns, or villages, [or lands,] watered by the
Euphrates, is said by Mtr to be an inf. n. used as
a subst. [properly so termed, and, being originally an inf. n., it may be used alike as sing. and
pl.]; or, in this phrase, a noun that should be
prefixed to it [such as ذَات], is suppressed: or,
accord. to some, it is سِقْى [q. v.], an instance of
the measure فِعْلٌ in the sense of the measure
مَفْعُولٌ; and thus it is in the handwriting of EI-
Hareeree in his 22nd Makámeh. (Har p. 246.)
―
-b2-  See also the next paragraph.
سِقْىٌ Drink; or what is drunk; (TA;) or
what is given to drink; (K, TA;) a subst. from
سَقَاهُ and أَسْقَاهُ; (S, TA; [in the former of which,

which land is irrigated;]) in the M, drink given
to camels: (TA:) pl. أَسْقِيَةٌ. (S, TA.) And
[particularly] A share, or portion, of water [for
irrigation]: one says, كَمْ سِقْىُ أَرْضِكَ [How
many bucketfuls or skinfuls, (the specificative
being suppressed,) virtually meaning how much,
is the share, or portion, of water for the irrigation of thy land?]. (S, TA.) ―
-b2-  And Water,
(K, TA, [in the CK ما, a mistranscription for
مَآءٌ,]) i. e. yellow water [meaning serum, effused
in dropsy], incidental in the belly, (K, TA,)
scarcely, or never, curable; (TA;) as also
↓ سَقْىٌ: (K: [وَيُفْتَحُ being there added: and the
word as meaning “ yellow water ” is written only
with fet-h in the JK: but in the TA, ويفتح forms
part of the addition here following:]) or it is in
white نَفَافِيخ [meaning cells] in the fat of the
belly; [in which sense, also, the word is written
only with fet-h in the JK;] and it [app. meaning the belly] is opened (وَيُفْتَحُ) on the occasion
of its issuing: so says ISd: (TA:) a subst. from
سَقَى بَطْنُهُ [q. v.]. (S, TA.) And A skin [or
membrane] containing yellow water, which cleaves
asunder from over the head of the young one [at
the birth]: (K, TA:) or, as in the T, the water
that is in the [membrane called] مَشِيمَة, that
comes forth عَلَى رَأْسِ الوَلَدِ [meaning at the birth].
(TA.)
-A2-  Also Land that is irrigated; having
the meaning of the measure مَفْعُولٌ, like نِقْضٌ [in
the sense of مَنْقُوضٌ]: (Er-Rághib, TA: [see also
سَقْى:]) or it signifies, (K,) or so ↓ سَقِىٌّ, of the
same measure as شَقِىٌّ and صَبِىٌّ, (Mgh,) and
↓ مَسْقَوِىٌّ, (S, Mgh, K,) app. a rel. n. from مَسْقًى,
not from مَسْقِىٌّ, for if it were from the latter it
would be مَسْقِىٌّ, (M, TA,) [or, accord. to some,
if from مَسْقِىٌّ, it may be either مَسْقِىٌّ or مَسْقَوِىٌّ,
(see Lumsden's Arab. Gr. p. 630,)] seed-produce
irrigated (S, Mgh, K) by water running upon
the surface of the earth; (S, Mgh;) [i. e., not
by rain only;] ↓ سَقِىٌّ being the contr. of بَخْسِىٌّ;
(Mgh;) and ↓ مَسْقَوِىٌّ, contr. of مَظْمَئِىٌّ, (Mgh,
TA,) which signifies “ watered [only] by the

-b2-
And A sending down of rain upon mankind and
the lands: (TA:) a subst. from سَقَاهُ اللّٰه الغَيْثَ.
(S, K, * TA. *) One says, دَعَوْتُ لَهُ بِالسُّقْيَا [I
prayed for him for the sending down of rain].
(JK.) And it is said in a form of prayer, سُقْيَا
رَحْمَةٍ وَلَا سُقْيَا عَذَابٍ [We ask of Thee a sending
down of a rain of mercy, and not a sending down
of a rain of punishment]; meaning, send Thou
down upon us a rain in which shall be benefit,
without injury, and without laying waste. (Msb.)
One says also أَرْضٌ خَافِضَةُ السُّقْيَا Land easy of
irrigation [either by the rain or otherwise]: (K
in art. خفض:) and the contr. is termed رَافِعَةُ
السُّقْيَا. (TA in that art.) ―
-b3-  Also i. q. شرب [i. e.
شِرْبٌ, meaning A beast's share, or portion, of
water]: so in the Kur xci. 13. (Jel.)
سِقآءٌ A skin, (KL,) or a قِرْبَة, (JK,) [i. e.] a
skin of a young goat or sheep when it has entered
its second year, (M, K,) used for water and for
milk, (ISk, JK, S, Msb, K, KL,) or, accord. to
ISd, only for water: (TA:) it is termed اِبْنُ أَدِيمٍ
[made of one hide; but there are larger sorts];
and if larger, it is termed اِبْنُ أَدِيمَيْنِ [made of
two hides], and اِبْنُ ثَلَاثَةِ آدِمَةٍ [made of three
hides]: (T and TA in art. بنى:) accord. to ISk,
the وَطْب is peculiarly for milk; and the نِحْى,
for clarified butter; and the قِرْبَة, for water: (S:)
the pl. (of pauc., S) is أَسْقِيَةٌ and أَسْقِيَاتٌ and (of
mult., S) أَسَاقٍ, (S, K,) or this last is a pl. pl. (T,
TA.) ―
-b2-  See also 4, last sentence. ―
-b3-  [And see a
phrase voce حِذَآءٌ, in art. حذو, where it is applied

stored.]
سَقِىٌّ: see سِقْىٌ, last sentence, in two places. ―
-b2-
Also A cloud having large drops [of rain], (S,
K,) vehement in the falling [thereof]: (S:) [like
رَمِىٌّ and رَوِىٌّ:] pl. أَسْقِيَةٌ. (S, K.) ―
-b3-  And The
papyrus (بَرْدِىّ): (JK, S, K:) or tender papyrus:
so called because of its growing in, or near to,
water: (TA:) occurring in a verse of Imra-el-
Keys, cited voce مُذَلَّلٌ: (S, TA: [but see what
is said under this word, مذلّل: and see Ham
p. 555:]) n. un. سَقِيَّةٌ. (S.) ―
-b4-  And Palm-trees;
(S, K;) and سَقِيَّةٌ signifies [the same, or] palmtrees that are irrigated by means of water-wheels
(دَوَالٍ, [pl. of دَالِيَةٌ, q. v.]). (TA.)
سُقَايَةٌ: see what next follows.
سِقَايَةٌ and ↓ سُقَايَةٌ and ↓ مَسْقَاةٌ and ↓ مِسْقَاةٌ A
place for giving to drink or for watering: (K, *
TA:) what is termed سِقَايَةُ المَآءِ is well known:
(S:) i. e. سِقَايَةٌ signifies a place made, or prepared, for the giving to drink to people: (Msb:)
a construction for water: (Mgh:) or a place in
which beverage is made, or prepared, at the fairs,
or festivals, &c.: (JK, T, TA:) [and particularly
a place in which a beverage made of raisins
steeped in water was given at the general assembly
of the pilgrims:] and ↓ مَسْقَاةٌ signifies a drinkingplace [in a general sense]: and he who pronounces
it with kesr to the م [↓ مِسْقَاةٌ] makes it to be like
the utensil called مِسْقَاةُ الدِّيكِ [the drinking-vessel
of the cock]: (S:) [see تُرْفَةٌ:] and the pl. is
مَسَاقٍ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  سِقَايَةٌ also signifies A vessel in
which one is given to drink: (K:) in the Kur
[xii. 70], it means the king's drinking-cup;
(Mgh;) his صُوَاع, in [or from] which he drank,
(JK, S, TA,) and with which they measured
corn; and it was a vessel of silver. (TA.) ―
-b3-
And سِقَايَةُ الحَاجِ means The beverage made of
raisins steeped in water which [the tribe of]
Kureysh used to give to the pilgrims to drink: it
was under the superintendence of El-'Abbás in
the Time of Ignorance and in El-Islám: (TA:)
or سِقَايَة in this phrase is an inf. n.; so in the
Kur ix. 19; (Mgh;) where it is said, أَجَعَلْتُمْ
سِقَايَةَ الْحَاجِ وَعِمَارَةَالْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ كَمَنْ آمَنَ بِآللّٰهِ
وَاليَوْمِ الْآخِرِ; the two words سقاية and عمارة being
inf. ns. of سَقَى and عَمَرَ; (Bd;) the meaning being
أَجَعَلْتُمْ أَهْلَ سِقَايَةِ الحَاجِ وَ عِمَارَةِ المَسْجِدِ الحَرَامِ
[i. e. Have ye made, or pronounced, the authors
of the giving to drink to the pilgrims, and of the
keeping in repair of the sacred mosque, to be like
him who has believed in God and the last day?];
and this is confirmed by another reading, which
is, سُقَاةَ الحَاجِ وَعَمَرَةَ المَسْجِدِ: (Ksh, Bd:) or the
meaning is, أَجَعَلْتُمْ سِقَايَةَ الحَاجِ كَإِيمَانِ مَنْ آمَنَ
[&c., i. e. have ye made, or pronounced, the
giving to drink to the pilgrims, &c., to be like the
belief of him who has believed &c.?]. (Bd.) [See

سَقَّآءٌ; and the fem. سَقَّآءَةٌ and سَقَّايَةٌ: see سَاقٍ,
in six places. ―
-b2-  السَّقَّآءُ is also the appellation of
A certain intelligent bird, that draws water for
itself. (JK.) [It is applied in the present day,
by some, to The pelican: and by some, to the
aquiline vulture; commonly called the رَخَم.]
سَاقٍ and ↓ سَقَّآءٌ Giving to drink; or one who
gives to drink: (K, TA:) the former signifies
[generally as above, or a cup-bearer: and also]
watering seed-produce; or a waterer of seedproduce: (Msb:) [and ↓ the latter generally signifies a water-carrier:] the pl. of the former is
سُقًّى, (K, TA,) with damm and then teshdeed,
(TA,) [accord. to the CK سُقِىٌّ, which is app. a
mistranscription,] and سُقَّآءٌ, (K, TA,) like رُمَّانٌ,
(TA,) or سُقَاةٌ: (CK: [this last is a well-known
pl. of سَاقٍ, and as such has occurred above, voce
سِقَايَةٌ:]) the pl. of ↓ سَقَّآءٌ is سَقَّاؤُونَ: (K:) and a
woman is termed ↓ سَقَّآءَةٌ and ↓ سَقَّايَةٌ. (S, K.) It
is said in a prov.,
↓ اِسْقِ رَقَاشِ إِنَّهَا سَقَّايَةٌ
[Give thou to drink to Rakáshi: verily she is one
who gives to drink: رَقَاشِ being a woman's
name]: it is applied to him who does good:
meaning do thou good to him, because of his
doing good. (A'Obeyd, S.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] سَاقِى
العَيْنِ A certain vein [app. the central artery of
the retina] which passes from the interior of the
head to the eye, and the severing of which occasions the loss of the sight. (JK.) [See also the
next paragraph.]

affix ة,] A rivulet, or streamlet, (T, K, TA,) for
the irrigation of seed-produce; (T, TA;) a small
