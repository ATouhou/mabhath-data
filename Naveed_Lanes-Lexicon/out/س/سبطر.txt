سبطرQ. 4
اِسْبَطَرَّ He stretched himself: (M:) he
lay upon his side, and stretched himself. (S, K.)
―
-b2-  He (a slaughtered beast) stretched himself to
die. (TA.) ―
-b3-  اسبطرّت الإِبِلُ فِى سَيْرِهَا The camels
hastened, (M, * K, * TA,) and stretched themselves,
in their march, or course. (TA.) ―
-b4-  اسبطرّت لَهُ
البِلَادُ The provinces became rightly disposed to
him. (Fr, K. *)
سِبَطْرٌ A lion stretching himself when about to
spring or leap. (S, K.) ―
-b2-  A quick camel: pl.
سِبَطْرَاتٌ: it has no broken pl. (Sb, M.) ―
-b3-  Also,
the pl. above mentioned, Camels long, upon the
surface of the ground [or horizontally]. (S, K.)
The ت [says J] is not the denotative of the fem.
gender: (S:) it is like that in رِجَالَاتٌ (S, K)
and حَمَّامَاتٌ, as masc. pls.: (S:) but IB says,
the ت in this word is the denotative of the fem.
gender; for it is an epithet applied to جِمَالٌ,
which is fem. as a [broken] pl.; as is shown by
the saying الجِمَالُ سَارَتْ, and رَعَتْ, &c.: and he
adds, J's saying that it is like رجالات and حمّامات
is a mistake, inasmuch as he confounds رجالات
with حمّامات; for رِجَالٌ is a fem. pl., as is shown
by one's saying الرِّجَالُ خَرَجَتْ, and سَارَتْ; but
حَمَّامٌ is masc., and should not regularly have a
pl. with ا and ت, but, as Sb says, it has this pl.
form, like some other masc. words, in lieu of a
broken pl., and would not have it if it had a
broken pl. (TA.) ―
-b4-  Also the sing., Penetrating;
effective; (Lth, M, K;) [as though stretching
far;] sharp in intellect; clever; acute: (K: [in
the CK, الماضِى السَّهْمِ is put by mistake for
الماضى الشَّهْمُ:]) or sharp in intellect, and very
bold or daring or courageous. (TA.) ―
-b5-  Lank
hair. (M.) ―
-b6-  A man (Sh) lank and tall. (Sh,
K.) ―
-b7-  And with ة, A corpulent woman. (M.)
سِبَطْرَى A proud and self-conceited gait, with
an affected inclining of the body from side to
side. (M, K.)
سُبَاطِرٌ: see what next follows.
سَبَيْطَرٌ and ↓ سُبَاطِرٌ Tall, or long. (M, K.) ―
-b2-
Also the former, A certain bird having a very
long neck, (S, K,) which one sees always in
shallow water; surnamed أَبُو العَيْزَارِ. (S.) [Freytag says, on the authority of Dmr, that it is also
called مالك الحزين. See art. ملك.]
