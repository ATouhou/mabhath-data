سدل1
سَدَلَهُ, aor.
سَدُلَ, (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) and
سَدِلَ,
(M, K,) inf. n. سَدْلٌ, (S, M, Mgh, Msb,) He let
it loose, let it down, lowered it, or let it fall; (S,
M, K;) namely, his garment, (S, M,) and hair,
(Fr, M, K,) and a veil, or curtain; (M;) and
سَدَنَهُ signifies the same; (Fr, TA;) as also
↓ اسدلهُ; (M, K;) or this latter is a mistake;
(Mgh; [but this the author asserts because, he
says, he had searched through books without
finding it except in the “ Nahj-el-Balághah; ”])
not allowable; (Msb;) and the former signifies
he let it down, or let it fall, namely, the garment,
without drawing together its two sides: (Mgh,
Msb:) or, as some say, he threw it upon his head,
and let it loose, let it down, or let it fall, upon his
shoulders: (Mgh:) and he let it down, or let it
fall, namely, hair, not مَعْقُوف [i. e. made recurvate at the extremities], nor tied in knots: (Lth,
TA:) and one says also, يَزْدُلُ ثَوْبَهُ, changing the
س into ز. (Sb, M.) The سَدْل that is forbidden
in prayer is The letting down one's garment without drawing together its two sides: or the enveloping oneself with his garment, and putting his arms
within, and bowing the head and body, and prostrating oneself, in that state; as the Jews used
to do; and this applies uniformly to the shirt and
other garments: or the putting the middle of the
إِزَار [or waist-wrapper] upon the head, and letting
fall its two ends upon one's right and left, without making it to be upon his two shoulder-blades.
(TA.) سَدَلَ عِمَامَتَهُ بَيْنَ كَتِفَيْهِ is said in a trad.
[as meaning He made the end of his turban to
hang down between his two shoulder-blades].
(Mgh.) And one says also, شَعَرَهُ عَلَى ↓ سدّل
عَاتِقَيْهِ وَعُنُقِهِ, [meaning He let his hair fall down
abundant and long upon his shoulders and his
neck,] inf. n. تَسْدِيلٌ. (ISh, TA. [See its pass.
part. n., voce مُنْسَدِلٌ.]) ―
-b2-  Also, aor.
سَدِلَ, (M, K,)
inf. n. as above, (TA,) He slit it, or rent it;
namely, his garment. (M, K.) ―
-b3-  And سَدَلَ فِى
البِلَادِ, (O, K,) inf. n. as above, (TA,) He went
away into the countries, or provinces. (O, K.)

انسدل [and accord. to Freytag ↓ تسدّل also,
but he names no authority for this, and I have not
found it in any MS. lexicon, but it is agreeable
with analogy as quasi-pass. of 2,] It was let
loose, let down, lowered, or let fall; said of hair
[&c.]. (MA, KL.) ―
-b2-  And انسدل يَعُدُو He was
somewhat quick, or made some haste, running;
like انسدر; the ر and ل being app. interchangeable. (Har p. 576.)

سُدْلٌ and ↓ سِدْلٌ [the former written in a copy
of the M سَدْل, but said in the K to be with
damm,] A veil, or curtain: pl. [of mult.] سُدُولٌ
and [of pauc.] أَسْدَالٌ (M, K) and أَسْدُلٌ. (K.)
In a verse of Homeyd Ibn-Thowr, as it is related
by Yaakoob, السُّدُول is used as a sing., because
it is of a measure which is [in some instances]
that of a sing., such as السُّدُوس, meaning a sort
of garment: but others relate it differently, saying
السَّدِيل, which is correctly a sing. (M.) [See
also سِدْنٌ.]
سِدْلٌ A string of gems or jewels: (S:) or a
string of pearls or large pearls, reaching to the
breast: (M, K:) pl. سُدُولٌ. (S.) ―

سَدَلٌ An inclining. (M, K.) [See أَسْدَلُ.]
سِدِلَّى, of the measure فِعِلَّى, an arabicized
word, originally, in Pers., سِهْ دِلَهْ [“ three-hearted ”],
as though it were three chambers in one chamber
(كَأَنَّهُ ثَلاَثَةُ بُيُوتٍ فِى بَيْتٍ), like the حَارِىّ بِكُمَّيْنِ
[i. e., I suppose, “like the garment of El-Heereh
with two sleeves; ” app. meaning that it signifies
An oblong chamber with a wide and deep recess
on either hand at, or near, one extremity thereof;
so that its ground-plan resembles an expanded
garment with a pair of very wide sleeves: in the
present day, it is commonly applied to a single
recess of the kind above mentioned, the floor of
which is elevated about half a foot or somewhat
more or less above the floor of the main chamber,
and which has a mattress and cushions laid
against one or two or each of its three sides].
(S.) [Golius explains it, as on the authority of
the S, (in which is nothing relating to it but what
I have given above,) thus: Pers. سِيدَلَهْ seu
سِدَرَهْ, i. q. سُدَّرٌ.]
سَدِيلٌ The thing [or hanging] that is let down,
or suspended, upon the [kind of camel-vehicle for
women called] هَوْدَج: (S, O, K:) pl. [of mult.]
سُدُولٌ and سَدَائِلُ and [of pauc.] أَسْدَالٌ: (S, O:)
the first of which pls. is expl. by As as meaning
the pieces of cloth with which the هودج is covered;
as also سُدُونٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also A thing [app. a
hanging or curtain] that is extended across, or
sideways, (يُعَرَّضُ,) in the space from side to side
of the [tent called] خِبَآء (فِى سَعَةِ الخِبَآءِ): and
(some say, M) the curtain of the حَجَلَة [or bridal
canopy, &c.,] of a woman: (M, K:) pls. as
above. (TA.)
سَنْدَلٌ, or سَمَنْدَلٌ, (accord. to different copies
of the S,) A certain bird, that eats [the poisonous
plant called] بِيش [generally applied to the common
wolf's-bane, aconitum napellus]: on the authority
of El-Jáhidh. (S.) [See also art. سمندل.]
سَوْدَلٌ The mustache. (S, IAar, K.) You say,
طَالَ سَوْدَلُهُ, (As, K,) or سَوْدَلَاهُ, (IAar,) His mustache, or mustaches, became long. (As, IAar, K.)
ذَكَرٌ أَسْدَلُ An inclining penis: (M, K:) pl.
[by rule سُدْلٌ, but it is said to be] سُدُلٌ, i. e. like
كُتُبٌ. (K.)
مُسْدَلٌ and مُسَدَّلٌ: see what follows.
مُنْسَدِلٌ Hair let loose, let down, lowered, or
let fall: (S:) or lank, or long, and pendent;
(M, K;) as also ↓ مُسْدَلٌ: (TA:) or abundant
and long, (Lth, TA,) and so ↓ مُسَدَّلٌ, (ISh, TA,)
falling upon the back. (Lth, TA.)
