locust, (S, K,) and of the female of the [lizard
called] ضَبّ, (TA,) [and of a fish, and the like,
(see سَرْءٌ,)] She laid eggs: (S, K, TA:) and سَرَتْ,
inf. n. سَرْوٌ, is a dial. var. thereof. (TA in art.
سرو.) [And accord. to El-Kanánee, as cited in
the TA, it seems that one says also, of locusts
(جَرَاد), سَرَأَ البَيْضَ and سَرَأَ بِهِ.] ―

سَرْءٌ and ↓ سَرْأَةٌ (M, K) and ↓ سِرْأَةٌ (K [for ويُكسر
in the CK should be وَتُكْسَرُ, referring to the second
form,]) and ↓ سِرْءٌ, (TA, [accord. to which وتكسر
refers to the س in the first and second, but this
I think improbable,]) or سرأة is with kesr [only,
i. e. ↓ سِرْأَةٌ], (S, K, [supposing that in the latter the
pronoun هِىَ refers to سرأة, but accord. to the
TA it means الكَلِمَةُ, so as to refer to سرء also,])
and most hold this to be correct, (TA,) The egg,
(S, K,) or eggs, (M,) of the locust, (S, M, K,) and
of the [lizard called] ضَبّ, (M, TA,) and of fish
(M, K, TA) and the like; (M, TA;) and سِرْوَةٌ
signifies the same, but is originally with ء: (S:)
accord. to 'Alee Ibn-Hamzeh El-Isbahánee,
↓ سِرْأَةٌ and سِرْوَةٌ signify the eggs of the locust;
but some say, only when laid: accord. to Lth,
سرء [app. سَرْءٌ] signifies the eggs of the fish and the
like, as also سُرُوْءٌ; [the former as a coll. gen. n.,
and the latter as its pl., agreeably with analogy;]
and one is called سرأة [app. ↓ سَرْأَةٌ as a n. un.,
agreeably with analogy; or it may be ↓ سِرْأَةٌ].
