سبك1
سَبَكَ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.
سَبِكَ, (S, K,) so
says El-Fárábee, and so in the Jm, and in the
handwriting of Aboo-Sahl El-Harawee, (TA,)
or
سَبُكَ, (Msb,) thus in the handwriting of Az,
(TA,) inf. n. سَبْكٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb,) He melted,
(S, Mgh, Msb, K, TA,) and cleared of its dross,
(Mgh,) and poured forth (K, TA) into a mould,
(TA,) gold, (Mgh, Msb, TA,) or silver, (S,
Mgh, TA,) &c.; (S, TA;) and ↓ سبّك signifies
the same, (K,) inf. n. تَسْبِيكٌ; (TA;) this inf. n.
and سَبْكٌ both signifying the melting of gold and
silver, and pouring it forth into a مِسْبَكَة [or
mould] of iron, like the half of a cane divided
lengthwise. (Lth, TA.) ―
-b2-  Hence, سَبْكٌ is metaphorically used in the sense of تَجْرِبَةٌ. (Har pp.
140 and 211.) One says, فُلَانٌ سَبَكَتْهُ التَّجَارِبُ
(tropical:)  [Such a one, tryings tried, or have tried, him].
(TA.) And كَلَامٌ لَا يَثْبُتُ عَلَى السَّبْكِ is another
tropical phrase [app. meaning (tropical:)  Speech or language, that does not stand good, or is not sound,
or valid, when tried, or tested; that will not stand
trying, or testing]. (TA.)

سَبَائِكُ. (Lth, S, Msb.) An Arab of the desert
likened to it a difficult mountain that he desired
to ascend, because of its smoothness; saying,
أَىُّ سَبِيكَةٍ هٰذِهِ [What an ingot is this !]. (A,
TA.) ―
-b2-  The pl. is also applied to وُقَاق [i. e.
(assumed tropical:)  Thin, flat, bread]; this being so called because
it is made of choice, or pure, flour; and is as
though it were prepared therefrom by being
melted and poured into a mould (كَأَنَّهُ سُبِكَ مِنْهَ),
and cleared from the bran. (TA.)
