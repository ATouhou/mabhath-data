سوسنسَوْسَنٌ, (M, Msb, K,) like جَوْهَرٌ [in measure],
(Msb, K,) by the vulgar pronounced سُوسَنٌ, with
damm to the first letter, (Msb, [and thus written
in one of my copies of the S, in the other of those
copies, and app. in most others, omitted,]) a
Pers., or foreign, word, (أَعْجَمِىٌّ,) current in the
language of the Arabs, (M,) [i. e.] an arabicized
word, [app. from the Pers. سُوسَنْ, in Hebr.
שׁוּשַׁן,] (S,) [applied in the present day to The
lily: and also the iris: and the pancratium:
and app. to other similar flowers:] a certain
plant, (M, Msb, K, *) of sweet odour, (K,) resembling what are called رَيَاحِين, with broad
leaves, but not having an odour that diffuses
itself like the رياحين; (Msb;) it is well known,
and of many kinds, the sweetest of which is the
white: (S: [but only, as mentioned above, in one
of my two copies thereof:]) there is a wild kind;
and the garden-kind is of two sorts, namely, the
آزَاد, which is the white, and the إِيرِسَآء, [i. e. the
iris, in the CK, erroneously, اَبْرَسا,] which is the
آسْمَانْجُونِىّ, [i. e. azure-coloured, from the Pers.
آسْمَانْ گُونْ,] beneficial as a remedy against the
dropsy, an attenuant of thick matters; and the
آزَاد is of a delicate, or subtile, nature, [so I here
render لَطِيفٌ, but it has other meanings,] beneficial as a remedy for cold disorders in the
brain, a discutient of the thick kinds of flatus
that collect therein; its أَصْل [app. here meaning
root] is a detergent of the skin, discutient; and
its leaves are beneficial as a remedy against the
burning of hot water, and against the sting of
venomous reptiles or the like, and particularly of
the scorpion: the n. un. is with ة. (K.)
