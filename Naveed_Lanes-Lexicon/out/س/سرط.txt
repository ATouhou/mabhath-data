سَرَطَ, inf. n. سَرَطٌ (S, M, Msb, K)
and سَرَطَانٌ; (M, K;) and سَرَطَهُ; (Sgh, K;) but
the former is the more chaste, and is the form
commonly known, and the latter is by some disallowed; (TA;) He swallowed it: (S, M, Msb,
K:) or, as in some of the copies of the S, without
chewing: or, accord. to the A, by little and little:
(TA:) and ↓ استرطهُ signifies the same; (S, M,
Msb, K;) and so ↓ تسرّطهُ: (As, K:) and in like
manner, زَرِدَهُ and ازدردهُ (TA) [and تزرّدهُ]. It is
said in a prov., لَا تَكُنْ حُلْوًا فَتُسْرَطَ وَلَا مُرًّا فَتُعْقَى
Be not thou sweet, so that thou shouldest be swallowed; nor bitter, so that thou shouldest be put
out of the mouth because of thy bitterness: (S,
TA:) or, accord. to one relation, فَتُعْقِىَ, i. e., so
that thou shouldest be disliked for being very
bitter: used in enjoining the taking of a middle
course of conduct: so in the O. (TA.)

(Msb;) a certain creeping thing (دَابَّة), of aquatic
creatures; (M;) a certain fluvial creeping thing
(دابّة); and also a marine kind, which is an
animal that becomes hard like stone: the former
kind is of much utility; the quantity of three
مَثَاقِيل of its ashes, when burnt in a cooking-pot
of copper (نُحَاسٍ أَحْمَرَ [for the latter of which
words we find in the CK خُمِّرَ]), with water or
wine, or with half its weight of gentian (جِنْطِيَانَا),
is very good against the bite of the mad dog; if
its eye be hung upon a person affected with a
tertian fever, he is cured; and if its leg be hung
upon a tree, its fruit falls spontaneously: (K:)
this is [said of] the سرطان that is bred in rivers:
(TA:) of the marine kind, what is burnt is an
ingredient in collyriums, (K,) for removing whiteness, (TA,) and in dentifrices (سَنُونَات, so in

-b3-  [The disease called cancer;]
a black-biliary tumour, which begins like an
almond, and smaller, and when it becomes large,
there appear upon it veins, red and green, resembling the legs of the سَرَطَان: there is no hope for
its cure; and it is treated medicinally only in
order that it may not increase: (K:) a certain
disease that attacks men and beasts: (M:)
it is also (K) a certain disease in the pastern of a
beast, rendering it hard, or rigid, so that the
animal inverts his hoof: (S, K:) a certain disease that appears in the legs of beasts: (T, TA:)
some say that it is a disease which affects a man
in his fauces, having relation to the blood, and
resembling the دُبَيْلَة [which is explained by ISh,
in describing the disease termed ذَاتُ الجَنْبِ, as
an ulcer that perforates the belly]: and some say,
that it is [the disease called] دَآءُ الفِيلِ. (TA.)
سِرْطِيطٌ: see سُرَطْ.
سُرَطْرِطٌ or سَرَطْرَطٌ: see سُرَطٌ.
سِرِطْرَاطٌ (Lth, Lh, S, M, K) and سَرَطْرَاطٌ, (Lth,
M, K,) the former said by Az to be a good form,
like جِلِبَّابٌ and سِجِلَّاطٌ, but the latter to be the
only instance of its form known to him, (TA,)
and ↓ سُرَيْطٌ, like زُبَيْرٌ, (accord. to the K,) or
↓ سُرَّيْطٌ, (as in the M,) like قُبَّيْطٌ, (TA, [in which
this is said to be the right form,]) [The kind of
sweet food called] فَالُوذٌ, [Lh, S, M, K,) or فَالُوذَجٌ;
(as in some copies of the K and in the TA;) so
called because very delicious to eat and swallow,
from سَرَطٌ signifying the “ act of swallowing; ”
(Az, TA;) of the dial. of Syria: (Lh, M:) or
[the kind of sweet food called] خَبِيصٌ. (M, K.)
سُرَاطٌ: see سُرَاطِىٌّ.
سِرَاطٌ A road, or way: (Msb:) or a conspicuous road or way; (M, K;) so called because
he who goes away on it disappears like food that
is swallowed; (K) i. q. صِرَاطٌ, (S, M, Msb, K,)
which is of the dial. of the early Kureysh, (Fr,)
and is the more approved, on account of the
mutual resemblance [of the ص and ط], (M, K,)
though the former is the original; (M, Msb, K;)
and زِرَاطٌ; for the saying that the pronunciation
with the pure ز is a mistake, is [itself] a mistake:
(K:) [ISd says,] As mentions the reading الزِّرَاط,
with the pure ز; but this is a mistake; for he
only heard the resemblance, and imagined it to
be ز; and As was not a grammarian, that he
should be trusted in this matter: (M:) this is
[itself, however,] a mistake; for AA is related to
have read الزّراط, and the same is related of
Hamzeh, by Ks. (TA.) One says also, هُوَ فِى
دِينِهِ عَلَى سِرَاطٍ مُسْتَقِيمٍ (tropical:)  [He is, in respect of his
religion, on, or in, a right way]. (TA.) [It is

↓ سِرْطِمٌ and ↓ سَرْطَمٌ; (Lh, M;) from الاِسْتِرَاطُ;
