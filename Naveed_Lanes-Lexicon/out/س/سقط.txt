ground; (Mgh;) or from a higher to a lower
place; (Msb;) namely, a thing from the hand;

and from a low place, as when said of a person in

(TA in art. هور;) and of a جُرْف [q. v.]: (Msb
and TA in that art.:) [and often used by anatomists and physicians, as meaning it delapsed; it
slipped, or fell, down:] and ↓ اِسَّاقَطَ [originally
تَسَاقَطَ] signifies the same; (K;) as in the phrase
in the Kur [xix. 25], تَسَّاقَطْ عَلَيْكِ رُطَبًا جَنِيًّا, or

the palm-tree (نَخْلَة) accord. to the former reading, and the trunk (جِذْع) accord. to the latter
reading, shall drop upon thee with fresh ripe
dates, plucked; رطبا جنيّا being transferred from
its proper place, and used as a specificative; the
meaning being, يَسَّاقَطْ رُطَبُ الجِذْعِ: so says Fr.
(Az, TA.) [This phrase of the Kur, with the
above-mentioned explanation, but less fully given,
occurs in a copy of the S which, throughout this
art., differs much from other copies.] You say also,
سَقَطَ فُلَانٌ مَغْضْلَرRِيًّا عَلَيْهِ [Such a one fell down in a

-b3-  سُقِطَ فِىيَدِهِ, and فى ↓ أُسْقِطَ
يده, (Fr, Zj, S, M, K,) but the former is more
common, and better, (Fr,) the latter allowed by
Akh, but disallowed by AA and by Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà [i. e. Th], (S,) [lit. There was a falling, and
there was a making to fall, upon his hand; i. e.,
of his hand upon his hand, or of his teeth upon
his hand, by reason of repentance, and grief, or

to see his right course: (O, K:) or both signify,
(TA,) or signify also, (K,) or the former signifies
also, (M,) he slipped; fell into an error, or a
fault; committed a mistake. (M, K.) Hence the
saying in the Kur [vii. 148], وَلَمَّا سُقِطَ فِى أَيْدِيهِمْ
(tropical:)  And when they repented: (S:) or struck their
hands upon their hands, by reason of repentance;
accord. to AAF: (M:) or repented greatly;
because he who repents, and grieves, or regrets,
bites his hand in sorrow, so that his hand is fallen
upon [by his teeth]: (Bd:) the phrase was not
known to the Arabs before the time of the Kur-án:
(O:) it has also been read سَقَطَ فى ايديهم, (Akh,
S, M,) as though النَّدَمُ were understood; (Akh,
S;) i. e. سَقَطَ النَّدَمُ; like as you say, قَدْ حَصَلَ
فِى يَدِهِ مِنْ هٰذَا مَكْرُوهٌ, likening what comes into
the heart, and into the mind, to what comes into
