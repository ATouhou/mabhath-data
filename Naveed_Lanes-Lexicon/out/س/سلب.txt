سلب1
سَلَبَهُ, (S, A, K,) aor.
سَلُبَ, (TA,) inf. n. سَلْبٌ
(S, K) and سَلَبٌ, (K,) from the former of which
the pl. سُلُوبٌ has been formed, on the authority
of hearsay, (El-Jurjánee, Msb in art. قصد,) He
seized it, or carried it off, by force; (S, A, K;)
as also ↓ استلبهُ. (S, K.) You say, سَلَبَهُ الشَّىْءَ,
aor.
سَلُبَ, inf. n. سَلْبٌ and سَلَبٌ; and إِيَّاهُ ↓ استلبهُ;
(M, TA;) He seized, or carried off, by force
[from him the thing; or he spoiled him, despoiled
him, plundered him, or deprived him, of the
thing]. (TA.) And سَلَبْتُهُ ثَوْبَهُ, (Mgh, * Msb,)
aor.
سَلُبَ, (Msb,) inf. n. سَلْبٌ, (Mgh, Msb,) I took
away from him his garment; (Mgh, * Msb;) as
also ↓ اسلبتهُ [perhaps a mistranscription for
↓ استلبتهُ, but another instance of the former of
these two verbs, in a similar sense, occurs in what
follows]: originally, سَلَبْتُ ثَوْبَ زيَدٍْ [I took away
the garment of Zeyd]; but the verb has been
made to have زيد for its object, and the ثوب is
postponed, and put in the accus. case as a specificative [though by rule the specificative should be
indeterminate]; and it may be suppressed, [so
that you may say simply, سَلَبْتُهُ, meaning I took
away from him what was upon him or with him,
spoiled him, or plundered him,] the meaning
being understood. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  [Hence] one says
also, سَلَبَهُ فُؤَادَهُ وَعَقْلَهُ (tropical:)  [He, or it, despoiled him,
or deprived him, of his heart and his reason],
and ↓ اسلبهُ. (A, TA.) [The latter one might
think to be a mistranscription for ↓ استلبهُ were it
not for an instance of the same verb before men-
tioned, and for the fact that it is immediately
followed in the A by وَهُوَ مُسْلَبُ العَقْلِ: perhaps,
however, مُسْلَب may be here a mistake for
مُسْلِب.] ―
-b3-  And اُسْلُبْ هٰذِهِ القَصَبَةَ (assumed tropical:)  Peel thou
this cane, or reed. (TA.) ―
-b4-  [In grammar and
logic, سَلْبٌ is used to signify (assumed tropical:)  Privation, or
deprivation, in a general sense; and (assumed tropical:)  negation;
opposed to إِثْبَاتٌ and إِيجَابٌ.]
-A2-  سَلْبٌ [as an
inf. n. of which the verb (app. سَلَبَ) is not mentioned] (assumed tropical:)  The going, or journeying, lightly and
quickly. (M, K.) Ru-beh says,
قَدْ قَدَّحَتْ مِنْ سَلْبِهِنَّ سَلْبَا
قَارُورَةُ العَيْنِ فَصَارَتْ وَقْبَا
(assumed tropical:)  [The black of the eye became depressed so that
it became a hollow in consequence of their going
with much lightness and quickness: سَلْبَا, for سَلْبًا,
being an absolute complement to the inf. n. in
سَلْبِهِنَّ]. (M. [See also 7.])
-A3-  سَلِبَ [or سَلِبَتْ,
as appears from what follows], aor.
سَلَبَ, (assumed tropical:)  He [or
she] put on black garments (K, TA) which
women wear at assemblies for the purpose of

أَحَدَّتْ [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  She abstained from the wearing of
ornaments, and the use of perfumes, and dye for
the hands &c., and put on the garments of mourning,] عَلَى زَوْجِهَا [for her husband]: (K:) or, as
some say, إِحْدَادٌ is for the husband; (S, A;) but
تَسَلُّبٌ is sometimes for another than the husband:
(S, TA:) [therefore] تسلّبت signifies (assumed tropical:)  she put on
the black garments of mourning; (M, TA;) as
also ↓ سلِّبت: (M, A:) you say, عَلَى ↓ تُسَلِّبُ
زَوْجِهَا or حَمِيمِهَا (Lh, M) (assumed tropical:)  She puts on the black
garments of mourning [for her husband or her
loved and loving relation or friend]: (M:) and

of the measure فَعَلٌ in the sense of the measure
مَفْعُولٌ, i. e., (TA,) i. q. مَسْلُوبٌ [used in the
manner of a subst., or as an epithet in which the

voce بَدَنٌ.]) ―
-b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  The peel, or rind, [or skin,]
of a cane, or reed, (K, TA,) and of a tree. (TA.)
And [particularly] The bark, or rind, of a kind
of tree (S, K) well known (S) in El-Yemen, of
which ropes are made, (S, K,) and which is
coarser and harder than the fibres of the Theban
palm-tree: (S:) hence it is that a well-known
kind of [thick] rope [made of the fibres of the
common palm-tree] is called by the vulgar ↓ سَلَبَةٌ:
(TA:) or the bark of a kind of tree of which are
made [baskets of the kind called] سِلَال: (Sh,
TA:) there is a market called ↓ سُوقُ السَّلَّابِينَ in
El-Medeeneh, (Sh, S, K, TA,) and in Mekkeh
also, as being the market [of the sellers, or manufacturers, of what are made] of سَلَب: (Sh, TA:)
it is also [said to be] (K) a certain kind of tall
tree, (M, K,) growing symmetrically, which is
taken and laid beneath hot ashes (يُمَلُّ) and then
split asunder, whereupon there comes forth form
it a white مُشَاقَة [or coarse fibrous substance] like
[the fibres of the palm-tree, called] لِيف; and it is
one of the best of the materials of which ropes are
made: the n. un. is with ة: (M:) and (M, K)
AHn says, (M,) it is a certain plant (M, K)
which grows in form like candles, except that it
is larger and longer, and of which are made
ropes of every sort: (M:) and (M, K) some say,
(M,) it is the fibrous substance (ليف) of the
Theban palm-tree, (M, K,) this Lth asserts it to
be, (TA,) which is brought from Mekkeh, (M,)
and Lth adds, and it is white; but Az says that
Lth has erred respecting it: A'Obeyd says, I
asked respecting it, and was told, it is not the
fibrous substance of the Theban palm-tree, but is
a kind of tree well known in El-Yemen, of which
ropes are made: and some say that it is the خُوص
[or leaves] of the ثَمَام [or panic grass]: and this
[says SM] is what is commonly known among
us in El-Yemen: (TA:) [accord. to Forskål,
(Flor. Aegypt. Arab., p. cx.) this name is applied
in El-Yemen to a species of hyacinth, which he
terms hyacinthus aporus.] A poet says, (S,)
namely, [Murrah] Ibn-Mahkán [El-Temeemee],
(M,)
فَنَشْنَشَ الجِلْدَ عَنْهَاوَهْىَ بَارِكَةٌ
كَمَا تُنَشْنِشُ كَفَّا فَاتِلٍ سَلَبَا
(S, M, *) i. e. And he stripped off quickly the
skin [from her, while she was lying upon her
breast, like as the two hands of the twister of
ropes strips off quickly the seleb]: (S in art.
نش:) some read قَاتِلٍ, meaning [by the word
following it] “ what is seized, or carried off by
force, from one slain: ” (M:) As read فَاتِلٍ, with
ف; IAar, with ق: Th says that the right reading
is that of As. (S in the present art.)

or, accord. to Az, the right meaning is, long in
the legs: (TA:) [for] ―
-b2-  سَلِبٌ signifies also Long

and to a woman: (M:) and of سَلِيبٌ as an epithet
applied to a tree. (S.)
سُلْبَةٌ i. q. جُرْدَةٌ [i. e. The denuded, or unclad,
part, or parts, of the body]: (IAar, K:) or a state
of nudity. (TA.) One says, مَا أَحْسَنَ سُلْبَتَهَا
[How goodly is what is unclad of her person!
or, her state of nudity!]. (K.)
سَلَبَةٌ: see سَلَبٌ, in the former half of the paragraph: ―

arrow: accord. to AHn, the sinew that is wound
upon the لِيط [or skin of the reed, or cane,] of the
arrow. (M.)
سِلَابٌ sing. of سُلُبٌ, which signifies The black
garments of women at their assemblies for mourning: (S:) MF says that the former is expl. in the
K as meaning black garments, which necessarily
implies that it is a pl.; and the latter is there said
to be its pl., which necessarily implies that it is a
sing.: (TA:) [but it may be replied that the
author of the K regarded the former as a pl.
without a sing.; and the latter, as a pl. pl.:] or
both signify black garments worn by women; and
the sing. is ↓ سَلَبَةٌ: (M:) accord. to the T, سِلَابٌ
signifies a black garment with which a woman
mourning for the death of her husband covers her
head: accord. to the R, a black خِرْقَة [or piece
torn off from a garment or cloth] that is worn

beloved, by death. (TA.)

-b2-  and more commonly
spoiled, despoiled, plundered, or deprived of what

[Hence] one says شَجَرَةٌ سَلِيبٌ (tropical:)  A tree despoiled,
or deprived, of its leaves and its branches: (M,
K, TA:) or of which the leaves and fruit have
been taken: (A:) pl. سُلُبٌ, as in the phrases
نَخْلٌ سُلُبٌ palm-trees upon which is no fruit,
and شَجَرٌ سُلُبٌ trees upon which are no leaves;
the sing. being of the measure فَعِيلٌ in the sense

↓ شَجَرَةٌ سُلُبٌ, [using سُلُبٌ as a sing., like other
words of the same measure mentioned in what follows,] meaning a tree of which the leaves have become
scattered, or strewn. (Az, TA.) And سَلِيبٌ is
applied to a woman as meaning (assumed tropical:)  Whose husband
has died, or her loved and loving relation or
friend, and who puts on the black garments of

with damm,] or ↓ سَلُوبٌ thus applied, (S, M,)
and ↓ سِلَابٌ, (M,) (assumed tropical:)  Whose young has died: (M,
K:) or that has cast her young one in an imperfect state: (S, M, K: and in this latter sense, as
applied to a she-camel, ↓ مُسْلِبٌ is particularly
mentioned in the M:) and in like manner applied
to a woman: (M, K:) the pl. (of سَلُوبٌ, S, M, or
سِلَابٌ, M) is سُلُبٌ (S, M, K, TA, in the last
expressly stated to be like كُتُبٌ, but in the CK

it signifies also العَقْلِ ↓ مُسْتَلَبُ (assumed tropical:)  [Despoiled, or
deprived, of reason]; (M, K;) and you say [also]

↓ مُسْلِب, see 1,] a tropical expression: (A:) pl.
سَلْبَى. (M, K.)
سَلَبُوتٌ, (Lh, M, K, TA, [in the CK, erroneously, سَلَبُوبٌ,]) of the measure فَعَلُوتٌ, from
