سبح1
سَبَحَ, aor.
سَبَحَ, inf. n. سَبْحٌ (Msb, K) and
سِبَاحَةٌ, (S, * K,) or the latter is a simple subst.,
(Msb,) He swam, syn. عَامَ, (S, * K,) بِالنَّهْرِ and
فِيهِ [in the river], (K,) or rather بِالمَآءِ (MF, TA)
or فى المَآءِ (Msb) [i. e. in the water], for it is likewise in the sea, and in a pool, and also in any
expanse: (MF, TA:) [or he swam upon the surface, without immersing himself; for,] accord. to
Z, there is a difference between عَوْمٌ and سِبَاحَةٌ;
the former signifying the “ coursing along in
water with immersion of oneself; ” and the latter,
the coursing along upon water without immersion
of oneself. (MF, TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] النُّجُومُ تَسْبَحُ
فِى الفَلَكِ (A, TA) (tropical:)  The stars [swim, or glide
along, or] pass along, in the firmament, with a
spreading forth. (TA.) It is said in the Kur
xxi. 34 and xxxvi. 40, with reference to the sun and
the moon, (Bd and Jel in xxi. 34,) with which
the stars are meant to be included, (Jel ibid.,)
كُلٌّ فِى فَلَكٍ يَسْبَحُونَ, i. e. (assumed tropical:)  All [glide or] travel
along swiftly, [in a firmament,] like the swimmer
(Bd and Jel ibid.) upon the surface of the water,
(Bd ibid.,) or in the water; (Jel ibid.;) wherefore the form of the verb used is that which is
appropriate to rational beings, (Bd and Jel ibid.,)
swimming being the act of such beings. (Bd
ibid.) ―
-b3-  And [hence] one says, سَبَحَ ذِكْرُكَ مَسَابِحَ
الشَّمْسِ وَ القَمَرِ ↓  (tropical:)  [Thy fame has travelled
as far as the sun and the moon; lit., swum along
the tracts along which swim the sun and the
moon]. (A, TA.) ―
-b4-  [Hence, likewise, as inf. n.
of سَبَحَ, aor. as above,] سَبْحٌ also signifies (tropical:)  The
running of a horse (S, L, K, * TA) in which the
fore legs are stretched forth well [like as are
the arms of a man in swimming]. (L, K, * TA.)
―
-b5-  And (assumed tropical:)  The being quick, or swift. (MF.) ―
-b6-
And (assumed tropical:)  The being, or becoming, remote. (MF.) ―
-b7-
And (assumed tropical:)  The travelling far. (K.) You say, سَبَحَ
فِى الأَرْضِ (assumed tropical:)  He went, or travelled, far, in, or
into, the land, or country: (O, TA:) and سَبَخَ:
both thus expl. by Abu-l-Jahm El-Jaafaree.
(TA.) ―
-b8-  And (assumed tropical:)  The journeying for the purpose
of traffic (تَقَلُّب [q. v.]); and [a people's] becoming scattered, or dispersed, in the land, or
earth. (K.) And (assumed tropical:)  The busying oneself in going
to and fro, or seeking gain, (IAar, TA,) and occupying oneself according to his own judgment or
discretion, in the disposal or management of
affairs, in respect of the means of subsistence.
(IAar, S, K, TA.) You say, فُلَانٌ يَسْبَحُ النَّهَارَ
كُلَّهُ فِى طَلَبِ المَعَاشِ (tropical:)  [Such a one busies himself in going to and fro, or occupies himself
according to his own judgment or discretion, in
seeking the means of subsistence]. (A, TA.) And
سَبَحَ فِى حَوَائِجِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He occupied himself according to his own judgment or discretion in the
accomplishment of his needful affairs. (Msb.)
―
-b9-  As used in the Kur [lxxiii. 7], where it is
said, إِنَّ لَكَ فِى النَّهَارِ سَبْحًا طَوِيلًا, it is variously
explained: (S, TA:) accord. to Katádeh (S) and
El-Muärrij, (S, TA,) the meaning is, (assumed tropical:)  [Verily
thou hast in the day-time] long freedom from
occupation; (S, K, * TA;) and in this sense, also,
its verb is سَبَحَ, aor.
سَبَحَ: (JM:) [thus it has two
contr. significations:] or, accord. to Lth, (assumed tropical:)  leisure
for sleep: (TA:) accord. to AO, the meaning
is, (assumed tropical:)  long-continued scope, or room, for free
action; syn. مُتَقَلَّبًا طَوِيلًا: and accord. to ElMuärrij, it means also (assumed tropical:)  coming and going: (S,
TA:) accord. to Fr, the meaning is, (assumed tropical:)  thou hast
in the day-time the accomplishment of thy needful
affairs: (TA:) or the meaning is, (assumed tropical:)  [long] occupation of thyself in thy affairs of business; not
being free from occupation therein for the reciting
of the Kur-án. (Jel.) Some read سَبْخًا, which
has nearly the same meaning as سَبْحًا. (Zj, TA.)
―
-b10-  As inf. n. of سَبَحَ, (TK,) it signifies also (assumed tropical:)  The
state of sleeping. (K.) And as such also, (TK,)
(assumed tropical:)  The being still, quiet, or motionless. (K.) ―
-b11-
[Also (assumed tropical:)  The glistening of the mirage.] You say,
سَبَحَ السَّرَابُ, or الآلُ, meaning لَمَعَ [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  The
mirage glistened]. (O.) ―
-b12-  And (assumed tropical:)  The digging,
or burrowing, in the earth, or ground. (K, * TA.)
You say of the jerboa, سَبَحَ فِى الأَرْضِ (assumed tropical:)  He dug,
or burrowed, in the earth, or ground. (O, TA.)
―
-b13-  And (assumed tropical:)  The being profuse in speech. (K.)
You say, سَبَحَ فِى الكَلَامِ (assumed tropical:)  He was profuse in
speech. (O, TA.) ―
-b14-  See also the next paragraph.

تَسْبِيحٌ signifies The declaring [God] to be
far removed, or free, from every imperfection or
impurity, or from everything derogatory from
[his] glory; syn. تَنْزِيهٌ, (S, O, Msb, TA,) and
تَقْدِيسٌ: (Msb:) the magnifying, celebrating,
lauding, or praising, and glorifying, God; and
declaring Him to be far removed, or free, from
everything evil. (TA.) You say, سَبَّحَ اللّٰهَ, (T,
A, Mgh, Msb, TA,) and سبّح لِلّٰهِ, (Kur lvii. 1 &c.,
and A,) in which the ل is redundant, (Jel in
lvii. 1 &c.,) inf. n. تَسْبِيحٌ, and سُبْحَانٌ is a subst.
that [sometimes] stands in the place of the inf. n.,
(T, TA,) or it is an inf. n. of which the verb is
سَبَحَ, (K, TA,) He declared God to be far removed, or free, from every imperfection or impurity &c., (A, Mgh, TA,) or from what they
say [of Him] who disacknowledge [his attributes];
(Msb;) [i. e. he declared, or celebrated, or extolled, the perfection or purity, or absolute glory,
of God;] and he magnified, celebrated, lauded, or
praised, God, by the mention of his names, saying
سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ and the like: (Msb:) and سبّح [alone],
(Mgh, K,) inf. n. تَسْبِيحٌ, (K,) he said سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ;
(Mgh, K;) as also ↓ سَبَحَ, inf. n. سُبْحَانٌ; (K,
TA;) the latter, which is like شَكَرَ, inf. n. شُكْرَانٌ,
a dial. var. mentioned by ISd; and no regard
should be paid to the saying of Ibn-Ya'eesh and
others, that سبحان is an inf. n. of which the verb
is obsolete: accord to El-Mufaddal, سُبْحَانٌ is the
inf. n. of ↓ سَبَحَ signifying he raised his voice
with supplication, or prayer, and magnification
or celebration or praise [of God, as when one
says سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ or the like]; and he cites as
an ex.,
قَبَحَ الْإِلٰهُ وَجُوهَ تَغْلِبَ كُلَّمَا
سَبَحَ الحَجِيجُ وَ كَبَّرُوا إِهْلَالَا
[May God remove far from good, or prosperity,
or success, the persons (وُجُوهَ here meaning نُفُوسَ)
of the tribe of Teghlib, whenever the pilgrims
raise their voices with supplication, &c., and say
اَللّٰهُ أَكْبَرْ, ejaculating لَبَّيْكَ]. (MF, TA.) وَنَحْنُ
نُسَبِّحُ بِحَمْدِكَ, in the Kur ii. 28, is a phrase
denotative of state, (Ksh, Bd, Jel,) meaning
While we declare thy remoteness from evil [of
every kind], (Ksh, Bd,) or while we say سُبْحَانَ
اللّٰهِ, (Jel,) praising Thee, (Ksh,) [or with the
praising of Thee, i. e.] making the praising of
Thee to be an accompaniment, or adjunct, to our
doing that: (Ksh, Bd, Jel:) so that we are the
more worthy to be appointed thy vice-agents.
(Ksh, * Bd, * Jel.) فَسَبِّحْ بِاسْمِ رَبِّكَ العَظِيمِ, in the
Kur lvi. 73 and last verse, means Therefore
declare thou the remoteness from what is unsuitable to his majesty by mentioning the name of
thy Lord, or by mentioning the Lord, for the
pronouncing of the name of a thing is the mentioning of it, [i. e., of the thing itself,] the great
name, or the great Lord: (Bd:) or it means
therefore pray thou commencing with, or uttering,
the name of thy Lord [the great name or Lord]:
(Kull p. 211:) [for] ―
-b2-  تَسْبِيحٌ also signfies The
act of praying. (K, Msb.) You say, سَبَّحَ meaning He prayed. (A, Mgh.) And [particularly]
He performed the [supererogatory] prayer of
[the period termed] الضُّحَى. (TA.) And فُلَانٌ
يُسَبِّحُ اللّٰهَ, i. e. ↓ يُصَلِّى السَّبْحَةَ, meaning Such a
one performs prayer to God, either obligatory or
supererogatory: [but generally the latter: (see
سُبْحَةٌ:)] and يُسَبِّحُ عَلَى رَاحِلَتِهِ performs supererogatory prayer [upon his camel that he is
riding]. (Msb.) It is said in the Kur [iii. 36],
وَسَبِّحْ بِالْعَشِىِّ وَالْإِبْكَارَ, i. e. And pray thou [in the
evening, or the afternoon, and the early morning].
(TA.) And it is related of 'Omar, أَنَّهُ جَلَدَ رَجُلَيْنِ
سَبَّحَا بَعْدَ العَصْرِ, meaning [That he flogged two
men] who prayed [after the prescribed time of the
afternoon-prayer]. (S, TA.) You say also, بِيَدِهِ
يُسَبِّحُ بِهَا ↓ سُبْحَةٌ [i. e. In his hand is a string of
beads by the help of which he repeats the praises
of God: see سُبْحَةٌ, below]. (A, Msb. *) ―
-b3-  Also
The making an exception, by saying إِنْ شَآءَ اللّٰهُ
[If God will]: because, by so saying, one magnifies God, and acknowledges that one should
not will unless God will: and thus is expl. the
saying in the Kur [lxviii. 28], أَلَمْ أَقُلْ لَكُمْ لَوْ لَا
تُسَبِّحُونَ [Did I not say to you, Wherefore will
ye not make an exception? addressed to the
owners of a garden, who “ swore that they would
certainly cut its fruit when they should be entering upon the time of morning, they not making
an exception ”]. (TA.)
3
سابحهُ, [inf. n. مُسَابَحَةٌ,] i. q. رَاسَاهُ, (T and
K in art. رسو,) i. e. He swam with him. (TK in
that art.) [And app. also He vied, or contended,
with him in swimming.]
4
اسبحهُ He made him to swim (K, TA) فِى
المَآءِ [in the water] or فَوْقَ المَآءِ [upon the water].
(TA.)
سَبْحَةٌ Garments of skins: (K:) or, accord. to
Sh, سِبَاحٌ, which is the pl., signifies shirts of
skins, for boys: AO corrupted the word, relating
it as written سُبْجَةٌ, with ج, and with damm
to the س; whereas this signifies “ a black [garment of the kind called] كِسَآء: ” and a verse
cited by him as presenting an ex. of its pl., in its
last word, is from a poem of which each verse has
for its fundamental rhyme-letter the unpointed ح:
ISd, in art. سبج, mentions سِبَاجٌ as signifying
“ garments of skin,” and having سبجة for its
sing.; but says that the word with the unpointed
ح is of higher authority; though he also states
it, in the same art., to have been corrupted by
AO. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [A meaning belonging to سُبْحَةٌ
(q. v.) is assigned in some copies of the K to
سَبْحَةٌ.]
-A2-  السَّبْحَةُ, (K,) or سَبْحَةُ, from سَابِحٌ as
an epithet applied to a horse, or mare, (IAth,
TA,) is a proper name of A horse, or mare,
belonging to the Prophet: (IAth, K, TA:) and
of another belonging to Jaafar the son of Aboo-
Tálib; (K;) or this was a mare named سَمْحَةُ:
(O:) and of another belonging to another. (K.)
سُبْحَةٌ Beads (S, Msb, K, TA) strung (Msb,
TA) upon a string or thread, (TA,) [ninety-nine
in number, and having a mark after each thirtythree,] with which (by counting them, K) one
performs the act termed التَّسْبِيح [meaning the
repetition of the praises of God, generally consisting in repeating the words سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهْ thirtythree times, الحَمْدُ لِلّٰهْ thirty-three times, and
اَللّٰهُ أَكْبَرْ thirty-three times, which is done by
many persons after the ordinary prayers, as a
supererogatory act]: (S, A, Msb, K:) its appellation implies that it is an Arabic word; but Az
says that it is post-classical: its pl. is سُبَحٌ (Msb)
and سُبُحَاتٌ also. (Har p. 133.) See 2, last
sentence but one. ―
-b2-  Also Invocation of God;
or supplication: (K:) and prayer, (A, Msb,)
whether obligatory or supererogatory: (Msb:)
or supererogatory praise; (S;) and supererogatory
prayer; (S, A, Mgh, K;) because of the تَسْبِيحٌ
therein. (Mgh.) You say, فُلَانٌ يُصَلِّى السُّبْحَةَ,
expl. above; see 2, in the latter part of the paragraph. (Msb.) And قَضَىسُبْحَتَهُ He performed,
or finished, his prayer: (A:) or قَضَيْتُ سُبْحَتِى
means I performed, or finished, my supererogatory praise and such prayer. (S.) And صَلَّى
السُّبْحَةَ He performed the supererogatory prayer:
(A:) and سُبْحَةَ الضُّحَى [the supererogatory
prayer of the period termed الضُّحَى]. (Msb.)
―
-b3-  سُبْحَةُ اللّٰهِ, (IAth, K, TA,) with damm, (TA,
[but in my MS. copy of the K written سَبْحَة,
and so in the CK,]) means (assumed tropical:)  The greatness, or
majesty, of God: (IAth, K, TA:) or [the pl.]
السُّبُحَاتُ, occurring in a trad., means (assumed tropical:)  the
greatness, or majesty, and the light [or splendour],
of God: (Msb:) or by the saying سُبُحَاتُ وَجْهِ
رَبِّنَا, with damm to the س and ب, is meant (assumed tropical:)  the
greatness, or majesty, of the face of our Lord:
(S:) or سُبُحَاتُ وَجْهِ اللّٰهِ means (assumed tropical:)  the lights [or
splendours], (K,) or, accord. to ISh, the light [or
splendour], (TA,) of the face of God: (ISh, K,
TA:) some say that سُبُحَاتُ الوَجْهِ means (assumed tropical:)  the
beauties of the face; because, when you see a
person of beautiful face, you say, سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ [to
express your admiration]: and some, that [when
it relates to God] it denotes a declaration of his
being far removed from every imperfection;
meaning سُبْحَانَ وَجْهِهِ. (TA. [See سُبْحَان.])
One says, [addressing God,] أَسْأَلُكَ بِسُبُحَاتِ وَجْهِكَ
الكَرِيمِ, with two dammehs, meaning (tropical:)  [I ask
Thee] by the evidences of thy greatness, or majesty,
[or of the greatness, or majesty, of thy glorious
face,] by the acknowledgement whereof thy praise
is celebrated. (A.) ―
-b4-  السُّبُحَاتُ also signifies
(assumed tropical:)  The places of prostration [probably meaning
in the reciting of the Kur-án]. (K.)
-A2-  Also,
i. e. [the sing.,] سُبْحَةٌ, A piece of cotton. (TA.)
سُبْحَانٌ is the inf. n. of سَبَحَ as syn. with سَبَّحَ
[q. v.]; (K, TA;) and is a subst. that [sometimes] stands in the place of the inf. n. of the
latter of these verbs, i. e. in the sense of تَسْبِيحٌ.
(T, TA.) ―
-b2-  سُبْحَانَ is a proper name in the
sense of التَّسْبِيح, and [for this reason, and also
because it ends with ا and ن,] it is imperfectly
decl., and is also invariable; being put in the
accus. case in the manner of an inf. n. (Mgh.)
You say سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ, meaning I declare [or
celebrate or extol] the remoteness, or freedom, of
God [from every imperfection or impurity, or
from everything derogatory from his glory,
i. e.] from the imputation of there being any
equal to Him, or any companion, or anything
like unto Him, or anything contrary to Him;
or from everything that should not be imputed to
Him: (L:) [I declare, or celebrate, or extol, his
absolute perfection or glory or purity: or extolled be his absolute perfection &c.:] or I declare
the remoteness of God, or his freedom (بَرَآءَة),
from evil, (Zj, * S, K, TA,) or from every evil;
(TA;) and [especially] from the imputation of
his having a female companion, and offspring:
(K:) or I declare God's being very far removed
from all the foul imputations of those who assert
a plurality of gods: (MF:) [it sometimes implies wonder, and may well be rendered how far
is God from every imperfection! &c.:] in this
case, سبحان is a determinate noun; (K;) i. e.,
a generic proper name, for التَّسْبِيح, like as بَرَّةُ is
for البِرُّ. (MF:) Zj says, (TA,) it is put in the
accus. case in the manner of an inf. n.; (S, K;)
i. e., as the absolute complement of a verb
understood; the phrase with the verb supplied
being أُسَبِّحُ اللّٰهَ سُبْحَانَهُ; (MF;) meaning أُبَرِّئُ
اللّٰهَ مِنَ السُّوْءِ بَرَآءَةً; (S, K, MF;) سبحان thus
supplying the place of the verb: accord. to Ibn-El-Hájib and others, when it is prefixed to another
noun or pronoun, governing it in the gen. case,
it is a quasi-inf. n.; and when not so prefixed, it
is a proper name, imperfectly decl.: but to this it
is objected that a proper name may be thus
prefixed for the purpose of distinction, as in the
instances of حَاتِمُ طَيِّئٍ and زَيْدُ الفَوَارِسِ: some
say that it is an inf. n. of an obsolete verb; but
this assertion is not to be regarded; for, as an
inf. n., its verb is سَبَحَ, like شَكَرَ of which the
inf. n. is شُكْرَانٌ: others say that it may be an
inf. n. of سَبَّحَ, though far from being agreeable
with analogy: and some derive it from السَّبْحُ as
signifying “ the act of swimming,” or “ the being
quick, or swift,” or “ the being, or becoming,
remote,” &c.: (MF:) [hence F adds,] or the
phrase above-mentioned denotes quickness in
betaking oneself to God, and agility in serving,
or obeying, Him; [and therefore may be rendered
I betake myself quickly to the service of God,
and am prompt in obeying Him;] (K;) so
accord. to ISh, to whom a man presented himself in a dream, and indicated this explanation of
the phrase, deriving it from سَبَحَ الفَرَسُ [“ the
horse ran stretching forth his fore legs, as one
does with his arms in swimming ”]. (L.)
فَسُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ حِينَ تُمْسُونَ وَحِينَ تُصْبِحُونُ, [in
which سبحان is used in the place of the inf. n. of
سَبَّحَ, and سَبِّحُوا is understood before it,] in the
Kur [xxx. 16], means Therefore perform ye
prayer to God [or declare ye the remoteness of
God from every imperfection &c.] when ye enter
upon the time of evening and when ye enter
upon the time of daybreak. (Fr, TA.) And
سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ عَمَّا يَصِفْونَ, in the Kur xxiii. 93,
means Far [or how far] is God from that by
which they describe Him! (Jel.) One says also,
سُبْحَانَكَ اللّٰهُمَّ وَبِحَمْدِكَ, meaning سَبَّحْتُكَ بِجَمِيعِ
آلَائِكَ وَبِحَمْدِكَ سَبَّحْتُكَ [i. e. I glorify Thee by
enumerating all thy benefits, and by the praising
of Thee I glorify Thee]. (Mgh. [See also the
prep. بِ.]) ―
-b3-  سُبْحَانَ مِنْ كَذَا, (Msb, K,) or
سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ مِنْ كَذَا, (S,) and سُبْحَانَ مِنْ فُلَانٍ,
(A,) are (tropical:)  phrases expressive of wonder (S, A,
Msb, K) at a thing (S, Msb, K) and a person;
(A;) originating from God's being glorified
(أَنْ يُسَبَّحَ اللّٰهُ) at the sight of what is wonderful
of his works, and afterwards, by reason of its
being frequently said, employed in relation to
anything at which one wonders; (Er-Radee,
TA;) meaning (assumed tropical:)  [I wonder greatly (lit., with
wondering) at such a thing and such a person;
as is shown by what follows; or] how extraordinary, or strange, is such a thing [and such a
person!]. (Msb.) El-Aashà says,
أَقُولُ لَمَّا جَآءَنِى فَخْرُهُ
سُبْحَانَ مِنْ عَلْقَمَةَ الفَاخِر
(S, Msb *) (assumed tropical:)  [I saying, when his boasting reached
me, I wonder greatly at' Alkameh the boasting];
i. e. العَجَبُ مِنْهُ, (S,) or [rather] عَجَبًا لَهُ [for
أَعْجَبُ عَحَبًا لَهُ], lit. I wonder with wondering at
him; (Msb;) [or how extraordinary a person is
'Alkameh the boasting !:] سبحان being without
tenween because it is regarded by them as a
determinate noun, and having a resemblance to a
fem. noun: (S:) [though in what quality it
resembles a fem. noun, except in its being of one
of the measures of broken pls., I do not know:]
or it is imperfectly decl. because it is a determinate noun, being a proper name for البَرَآءَة (IJ,
IB) and التَّنْزِيه, (IJ,) and because of the addition
of the ا and ن: (IJ, IB:) this is the true reason:
but some hold that it is rendered determinate by
its being prefixed to a noun understood, governing
it in the gen. case; the complete phrase being
سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ مِنْ عَلْقَمَةَ. (MF.) ―
-b4-  سُبْحَانًا, thus
with tenween, as an indeterminate noun, occurs
in the phrase سُبْحَانَهُ ثُمَّ سُبْحَانًا, in a poem of
Umeiyeh. (IB.)
-A2-  سُبْحَان is also used in the
sense of نَفْس, in the saying أَنْتَ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا فِى
سُبْحَانِكَ [Thou art possessed of more, or most,
knowledge of that which is in thine own mind]. (K.)
سَبُوحٌ: see سَابِحٌ, in three places.
سِبَاحَةٌ an inf. n., (K,) or a simple subst.,
(Msb,) from سَبَحَ; (Msb, K;) Natation; or the
act [or art] of swimming: (S, A, Msb, * K:) or
the coursing along upon water without immersion
of oneself. (MF, TA. [See 1, first sentence.])
سَبَّاحٌ: see سَابِحٌ, in two places.
سُبُّوحٌ, also pronounced سَبُّوحٌ, (T, S, Msb, K,
&c.,) the latter the more agreeable with analogy,
but the former the more common, (Th, T, S,
Msb, *) one of the epithets applied to God, (T,
S, A, Msb, * K,) because He is an object of
تَسْبِيح, (K,) and [often] immediately followed by
قُدُّوسٌ, (A, Msb, K,) which is likewise also pronounced قَدُّوسٌ, though the former pronunciation
is the more common: (Th, T, S, Msb: *) it signifies [All-perfect, all-pure, or all-glorious; i. e.]
far removed, or free, from everything evil, (Zj,
Mgh, Msb, TA,) and from every imperfection
[and the like]. (Msb. [See 2, and see also
سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ.]) It is said (S, Msb) by Th (S) that
there is no word like the two epithets above, of
the measure فعُّول with damm as well as with
fet-h to the first letter, except ذرّوح: (S, Msb:)
but the following similar instances have been
pointed out: ستّوق among epithets, and ذرّوح and
شبّوط and فرّوج and سفّود and كلّوب among
substs. (TA.) Sb says, لَيْسَ فِى الكَلَامِ فُعَّوْلٌ
بِوَاحِدَةٍ [expl. voce ذُرَّاحٌ]: (S:) [or] accord. to
AHei, Sb said that there is no epithet of the
measure فُعُّولٌ except سُبُّوحٌ and قُدُّوسٌ: Lh
mentions سُتُّوقٌ also, as an epithet applied to a
دِرْهَم, as well as سَتُّوقٌ. (TA.)
السَّبَّاحَةُ: see المُسَبِّحَةُ, in two places.
سَابِحٌ and ↓ سَبَّاحٌ (Msb, K) and ↓ سَبُوحٌ (K)
are part. ns., or epithets, from سَبَحَ in the first of
the senses assigned to it above: (Msb, K:) [the
first signifies Swimming, or a swimmer:] the
second has an intensive signification [i. e. one
who swims much, or a great swimmer; as also
the third]: (Msb:) the pl. of the first, accord. to
IAar, not of the first and last as it appears to be
accord. to the K, is سُبَحَآءُ: (MF:) that of the
second is سَبَّاحُونَ: (K:) and that of the third is
سُبُحٌ or سِبَاحٌ, the former reg., and the latter
irreg. (MF.) ―
-b2-  السَّابِحَات, (K, &c.,) in the Kur
[lxxix. 3], accord. to Az, (TA,) means The
ships: (K:) or (assumed tropical:)  the souls of the believers أَرْوَاحُ
المُؤْمِنِينَ [for which Golius seems to have found
in a copy of the K أَزْوَاجُ المُؤْمِنِينَ, for he gives
as an explanation piæ et fidelium uxores,,]) (K,
TA) which go forth with ease: or (assumed tropical:)  the angels
that swim, or glide, (تَسْبَحُ,) from (من [app. a
mistranscription for بَيْنَ between]) the heaven
and the earth: (TA:) or (assumed tropical:)  the stars, (K,) which
swim, or glide along, (تَسْبَحُ,) in the firmament,
like the سَابِح in water. (TA.) [The meanings
fœminæ jejunantes and veloces equi and planetæ,
assigned to this word by Golius as on the authority
of the KL, are in that work assigned to سَائِحَات;
the first of them as the meaning of this word in
the Kur lxvi. 5.] And you say نُجُومٌ سَوَابِحُ
(tropical:)  [Stars gliding along in the firmament: سوابح
being a pl. of سَابِحٌ applied to an irrational thing,
and of سَابِحَةٌ]. (A.) ―
-b3-  سَابِحٌ is also applied as
an epithet to a horse, (S, IAth, A, L,) meaning
(tropical:)  That stretches forth his fore legs well in running
[like as one does the arms in swimming]; (S, *
IAth, L;) and in like manner ↓ سَبُوحٌ [but in an
intensive sense]: (A, L:) the pl. [of the former]
is سَوَابِحُ and سُبَّحٌ. (A.) And سَوَابِحُ also signified (tropical:)  Horses; (K, TA;) as an epithet in which
the quality of a subst. is predominant; (TA;)
because they thus stretch forth their fore legs in
running. (K, * TA.) Hence, (TA,) ↓ السَّبُوحُ is
the name of A horse of Rabeea Ibn-Jusham.
(K, TA.) And in like manner, ↓ السَّبَّاحُ is the
name of A celebrated courser: (TA:) and of A
certain camel. (K, TA.)

this art.
مُسَبَّحٌ, accord. to AA and the K, applied as an
epithet to a [garment of the kind called] كِسَآء,

so applied, means “ made wide. ” (TA.)
مُسَبِّحٌ [act. part. n. of 2]. فَلَوْلَا أَنَّهُ كَانَ مِنَ
المُسَبِّحِينَ, in the Kur [xxxvii. 143], means And
had he not been of the performers of prayer,
(A, * Mgh, Msb, K, *) as some say. (Mgh.)

(tropical:)  [The index, or fore finger;] the finger that is
next the thumb: (Msb, TA:) so called because
it is like the glorifier when one makes a sign
with it [by raising it] when declaring [the unity
of] the divine essence. (Msb, TA. *) One says,
أَشَارَ إِلَيْهِ بِالمُسَبِّحَةِ and ↓ بِالسَّبَّاحَةِ (tropical:)  [He pointed
towards him, or it, with the fore finger]. (A, TA.)
