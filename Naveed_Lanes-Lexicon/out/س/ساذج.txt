ساذجسَاذَجٌ (O, K, TA) and سَاذِجٌ (TA) arabicized
from [the Pers.] سَادَهْ: (O, K: [in some copies of
the K سَاذَهْ:]) this is the only explanation in some
of the copies of the K: (TA:) Plain; i. e. without variegation, decoration, embellishment, or
engraved or sculptured work: (O, TA:) or without any hair upon it: or of one unmixed colour:
this last is [said to be] the correct meaning [in
many instances]; but the sheykh Welee-ed-Deen
El-'Irákee says, in the Expos. of the “ Sunan ”
of Aboo-Dáwood, respecting a pair of boots of the
Prophet, described as خُفَّانِ أَسْوَدَانِ سَاذَجَانِ or
سَاذِجَانِ, that this phrase seems to mean A pair
of black boots of one unmixed colour; the last
word being used in this sense in the common
conventional language; though he had not found
it with this meaning in the lexicons, nor in the
books of authors on the strange words occurring
in traditions. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also Free from self-constraint: and one who knows not badness, wickedness, deceit, or guile; in whom is no latent rancour,
malevolence, malice, or spite, nor cunning: (O:)
or free in intellect; and easy [or simple or artless]
in nature or disposition. (TA in art. سدج.) ―
-b3-
حُجَّةٌ سَاذَجَةٌ, also written سَاذِجَةٌ, is used by
authors on the scholastic theology of the Muslims
as meaning An argument, a plea, an allegation,
an evidence, or a testimony, that is undecisive:
and sometimes the same epithet is used [in like
manner] in other cases. (L.)
-A2-  In some copies
of the K, it is said to be [the name of] Certain
roots and shoots, that grow in waters, useful for
such and such things; arabicized from ساذه [or
سَادَهْ]: (TA:) or certain leaves and shoots, (O,
CK,) used as a medicine, having a flower; one
sort thereof called رُومِىٌّ; and another, هِنْدِىٌّ;
[the latter name, i. e. سَاذَجٌ هِنْدِىٌّ, as well as سَاذَجٌ
alone, applied in the present day to malabathrum,
or Indian spikenard;] growing in waters that
collect and stagnate in black muddy lands, (O,)
standing up on the surface of the water, (O,
CK,) like the plant called عَدَسُ المَآءِ, (O,) without attachment to a root; (O, CK;) beneficial
for swellings of the eye. (CK.)
