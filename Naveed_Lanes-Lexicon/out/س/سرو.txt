reason it is called الدِّرْعِيَّةُ, its head entering like

it is mentioned also in art. سرى, [as being a
small, short, round and smooth arrow-head,
having no breadth, and as being called سِرْوَةٌ and
سِرْيَةً,] because the word belongs to that art. and
to this: (M:) [see also مِرْمَاةٌ; and see سِرْوَةٌ in
art. سرأ:] the pl. is سُرًى [or سِرًى?] accord. to
the T, or سِرَآءٌ accord. to the S. (TA.)

[See also جَرَادٌ.]
سَرِىٌّ, as an epithet applied to a man, (S, M,
K, &c.,) may be from اِسْتَرَيْتُ الشَّىْءَ “ I chose, or
selected, the thing,” or from السَّرَاةُ “ the higher,
or highest, part ” of a thing, (Ham p. 337,) or,
accord. to Er-Rághib, from سَرَوْتُ الثَّوْبَ عَنِّى “ I
pulled off the garment from me,” (TA, [in which
this derivation is said to be good, but I think it
far-fetched,]) Possessing liberality, bountifulness,
munificence, or generosity, combined with manliness, or manly virtue: (S, Mgh:) or possessing
manliness, or manly virtue, (M, K,) and, (M,)

(M, K:) and ↓ مَسْرَوَانٌ signifies the same, applied to a man; and ↓ مَسْرَوَانَةٌ applied to a
woman: (M:) the pl. of سَرِىٌّ is أَسْرِيَآءُ and سُرَوَآءُ
(Lh, M, K) and سُرًى, (Az, K,) which is anomalous, (TA,) and سَرَاةٌ, (T, S, Mgh, * Msb,) [originally سَرَوَةٌ,] which is [also] anomalous, (T,
TA,) the only instance of فَعَلَةٌ as the measure of
a pl. of a word of the measure فَعِيلٌ, (S, Msb,)
or it is a quasi-pl. n., (Sb, M, K,) and its pl. is

or choice, or select: (M:) what is good of anything; pl. [or quasi-pl. n.] سَرَاةٌ: (Ham p. 337:)

p. 57, and Har ubi suprà;) the former, of men,
(Har ubi suprà,) and of camels; (S;) and the
latter, of men, (S, TA, and Ham ubi suprà, and

-A2-  See also
art. سرى.
سُرِّيَّةٌ, said by some to be originally of the
measure فُعُّولَةٌ, from سَرْوٌ: see art. سر.
أَسْرَى is of the measure أَفْعَلُ [denoting the
comparative and superlative degrees] from السَّرْوُ
signifying “ liberality, bountifulness, munificence,
or generosity, combined with manliness, or manly
virtue: ” [&c.:] whence the phrase أَسْرَاهُمْ سُودَدًا,
meaning The best of them in respect of chiefdom
or the like: or it may be from السُّرَى; meaning
in this instance that the fame of the chiefdom, or
the like, of him to whom it relates has pervaded
the countries and spread among mankind; and
this is more worthy of regard in respect of the
method of grammatical analysis; from Mtr:
(Har p. 363: [see art. سرى:]) [ISd, however,
assigns the word to the present art.:] see 5, last
sentence.
أَرْضٌ مَسْرُوَّةٌ A land containing the سِرْوَة, or
locust in its first state, when it is a larva. (S.)
[In a copy of the M, it is said to be from السَّرْوَةُ;
and the context there indicates the meaning to
be A land infested by a worm of the kind termed
سَرْوٌ, of which سَرْوَةٌ is the n. un.: but probably
السَّرْوَةُ, in this instance, is a mistranscription for
السِّرْوَةُ, which is mentioned immediately after as
meaning “ the locust in its first state of growth,
when it comes forth from its egg. ”]
مَسْرَوَانٌ; and its fem., with ة: see سَرِىٌّ.
