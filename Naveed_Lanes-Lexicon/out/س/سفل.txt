سَفِلٌ from سَفِلَ, and ↓ سَفِيلٌ from سَفُلَ, (assumed tropical:)  A
low, base, vile, ignoble, mean, or sordid, man:
(MA:) or ↓ سَفيلٌ signifies low (↓ سَافِلٌ) [in condition], deficient in lot, or fortune: (TA:) and
↓ سَفِلَةٌ, (S, M, MA, Mgh, Msb, K,) said by some
to be from this word as signifying the “ legs ” (Mgh,
Msb) of a camel (Mgh) or of a beast, or quadruped, (Msb,) and ↓ سِفْلَةٌ, (S, M, MA, Mgh
Msb, K,) a contraction of سَفِلَةٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb,

by Sgh and IB on the authority of Yoo and IKh,
and is said to mean the lowest, basest, &c., of the
low, base, &c.: the pl. of ↓ سِفْلَةٌ is سِفَلٌ; (TA;)
one should not say, ↓ هُوَ سَفِلَةٌ because this is
[used only as] a pl.: (S:) the vulgar say رَجُلٌ
مِنْ قَوْمٍ سِفَلٍ ↓ سِفْلَةٌ; (S, Mgh; *) but this has
been disallowed: (Mgh:) a man is related to
have said to his wife, (Mgh, TA,) who had called
him سِفْلَةٌ, (TA,) إِنْ كُنْتُ سِفْلَةً فَأَنْتِ طَالِقٌ,
(Mgh, TA,) meaning If I be low, base, &c., in
my intellect and my religion [thou art divorced];
(Mgh;) whence it seems that سِفْلَةٌ may be applied to a single person; but this requires consideration. (TA.) ↓ أَيْمَانُ السَّفِلَةِ means (assumed tropical:)  [The
oaths] of the ignorant: or accord. to Aboo-
Haneefeh, of the heretics, or schismatics: such
[oaths] are said to be وَوَجْهِ اللّٰهِ and وَأمَانَةِ اللّٰه.

low: or] we reduced him to extreme old age, or
decrepitude: or to a state of perishing, or passing

is born of the natural constitution with which he
is created in his mother's womb, and he who disbelieves and errs is reduced to this state: (M:) or
the meaning is, we have made him to be of the
people of the fire [of Hell]: or [we have made
