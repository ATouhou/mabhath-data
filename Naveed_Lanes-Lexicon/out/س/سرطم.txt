سرطمQ. 1
سَرْطَمَ He (a man) was, or became, silent.
(Sh, TA in art. رطم.) ―
-b2-  [From what follows, it
would seem to signify also He was perspicuous
in speech, or eloquent.]
سَرْطَمٌ Long, or tall; (S, K;) as also ↓ سِرْطِمٌ: (K:)
in the latter sense, the former epithet is applied to a
man; as also ↓ سِرْطُومٌ and ↓ سُرَاطِمٌ: (M:) and
a poet (namely 'Adee Ibn-Zeyd, TA) uses the
phrase سَرْطَمُ اللَّحْيَيْنِ [long in the two jaw-bones].
(S.) ―
-b2-  And The gullet; because of its width.
(M.) ―
-b3-  And, as also ↓ سِرْطِمٌ, Wide in the fauces,
quick in swallowing, (M, K,) or that swallows
much, (TA,) with [largeness of] body and make:
(M, K:) or that swallows everything: held by
Kh to be of the triliteral-radical class; (M, TA;)
and mentioned in art. سرط. (TA. [See سُرَاطِىٌّ.])
―
-b4-  And hence ↓ the latter, (assumed tropical:)  An eloquent speaker:
(M in art. سرط and in the present art., and
K * in the former:) or perspicuous in speech;
(M and K in the present art.;) as also سَرْطَمٌ.
(K.) ―
-b5-  سَرْطَمٌ is also expl. as meaning الذى
يستوعب الزمام [which may be rendered That
takes the whole of the nose-rein, or leading-rope;
but the exact meaning must be determined from
the context]; and so ↓ سُرْطُمَانٌ. (Freytag, from
the Deewán of Jereer.)
