سُقْمٌ and ↓ سَقَمٌ and ↓ سَقَامٌ [are all inf. ns.; or
the last, accord. to the Msb, is a simple subst.;
and all are used as substs., signifying] A disease,
disorder, distemper, malady, sickness, or an
illness; syn. مَرَضٌ: (S, K, TA:) سُقْمٌ and مَرَضٌ
are both said to be in the body, and also (assumed tropical:)  in
religion [&c., as is implied by phrases mentioned
below, voce سَقِيمٌ]: (Aboo-Is-hák, TA in art.
مرض:) pl. [of the first] أَسْقَامٌ. (TA.) ↓ سَقَمُ
الجُفُونِ means (assumed tropical:)  Languidness, and slowness in

also مِسْقَامٌ, and مُسْقِمٌ. The phrase إِنِي سَقِيمٌ,
occurring in the Kur [xxxvii. 87], as a saying of
Abraham, is expl. by some as meaning [Verily I
am] smitten with the طَاعُون [or pestilence]: or
the meaning is, I shall be diseased at a future
time, when the period shall have come; and it is
said that he inferred, from looking at the stars,
the time of a fever's coming to him: or it means
(assumed tropical:)  verily I am sick of your worshipping what is
not God: IAth says that, in truth, it is one of his
three lies; all of which were for the sake of God
and his religion. (TA.) You say also قَلْبٌ سَقِيمٌ

malevolence, malice, or spite, against him. (TA.)
سَوْقَمٌ A kind of tree resembling the خِلَاف
[q. v.], but not the same as this latter: (TA:) or
a kind of large tree, (AHn, K, TA,) exactly like
the أَثْأَب, (AHn, TA,) which is a tree of the figkind, (TA in art. ثأب,) except that it is taller
than the latter, and less broad, having a fruit
like the fig (التِين), which, when green, is [like]
stone in hardness, but when it ripens it becomes
somewhat yellow, and soft, and very sweet, and
of a pleasant odour, and people send it, one to
another, as a present. (AHn, TA.) [Forskål, in
his Flora Aegypt. Arab., p. cxxiv., mentions
سقم, which is evidently a mistranscription for
سوقم, and which he writes in Italic letters
“ sokam,” as one of the names of the ficus sycomorus; and app. of another species or variety of
fig which he terms ficus sycomoroides.]
مُسْقِمٌ ↓ رَجُلٌ سَقِيمٌA man who is diseased and
