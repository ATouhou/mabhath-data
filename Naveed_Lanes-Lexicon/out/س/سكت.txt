K to signify the same, but this is not exactly the
case, for the last is of an intensive form,] He

of نَطَقَ; (TA;) i. q. صَمَتَ: (Lth, Msb, TA:)
or سَكَتَ is said of him who has the power, or
faculty, of speech, but abstains from making use
of it; whereas صَمَتَ is sometimes said of that
which has not the power, or faculty, of speech:
(Er-Rághib, MF, TA:) or سَكَتَ, aor.
سَكُتَ, inf. n.
سُكُوتٌ and سَكْتٌ, signifies he (a man) ceased, or
stopped, speaking; and سَكَتَ, aor.
سَكُتَ, inf. n. سَكْتٌ,
(assumed tropical:)  he (a man) was, or became, still, or quiet;
syn. سَكَنَ: (Zj, TA:) [it is said that] ↓ اسكت,
also, is syn. with صَمَتَ, like سَكَتَ; (Msb;)
accord. to AZ, one says of a man, صَمَتَ and
أَصَمَتَ and سَكَتَ and ↓ أَسْكَتَ: (TA:) or, as
some say, ↓ اسكت signifies he was, or became,
silent, or he spoke not; and he ceased [from
speech], or broke off [therefrom], or became cut
short [therein]: (Msb:) or سَكَتَ signifies he
was, or became, silent intentionally; and ↓ اسكت,
he was, or became, silent by reason of thought or
disease or fear: (TA:) or you say تَكَلَّمَ ثُمَّ سَكَتَ
without ا [when you mean he spoke and then
became silent, i. e., intentionally]; (S) but you
say ↓ اسكت when you mean his speech became
broken off, or cut short, and so he spoke not. (S,
K.) It is said in a prov., سَكَتَ أَلْفًا ونَطَقَ خَلْفًا
He held his tongue from a thousand words
(سَكَتَ عَنْ أَلْفِ كَلِمَةٍ), and then uttered what
was wrong. (ISk, S and Msb in art. خلف.) And
you say [of the quiescent ه that is sometimes
added at the end of a word, after a vowel or a
letter of prolongation, as in لَمْ يَرْضَهْ and وَا زَيْدَاهْ],
هٰذِهِ هَآءُ السَّكْتِ [This is the هاء of pausation].
(A, TA.) One says also, of a she-camel, سَكَتَتْ,
inf. n. سُكُوتٌ, meaning She uttered not the [grumbling] cry termed رُغَآء when the saddle was put
upon her. (ISd, TA.) ―

above, inf. n. سَكْتٌ, as syn. with سَكَنَ, meaning
as expl. above; and also (assumed tropical:)  It was, or became,
still, quiet, motionless, at rest, stilled, quieted,
appeased, tranquillized, calm, allayed, assuaged,

↓ اسكت.] You say, ضَرَبَهُ حَتَّى سَكَتَتْ حَرَكَتُهُ (A)
or حركته ↓ أَسْكَتَتْ (TA) (tropical:)  [He beat him until
his motion became stilled]; and ↓ حتّى أَسْكَتَ

i. q. سَكَنَ, (S, Msb, TA,) meaning فَتَرَ [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  The
anger remitted; or became stilled, appeased, or
allayed]; (TA:) as also ↓ اسكت: (Msb:) and
سَكَتَ عَنْهُ الغَضَبُ (tropical:)  [Anger, or the anger, became
stilled so that it departed from him]. (A.)
Hence, in the Kur [vii. 153], وَلَمَّا سَكَتَ عَنْ مُوسَى
الغَضَبُ, (S,) meaning, accord. to Zj, سَكَنَ [i. e.
(assumed tropical:)  And when the anger became stilled so that it
departed from Moses]: or, as some say, the
phrase is inverted, the meaning being وَلَمَّا سَكَتَ
مُوسَى عَنِ الغَضَبِ [And when Moses was silent,
ceasing from anger]: but the former is the explanation of those skilled in the Arabic language.
(TA. [See also 4.]) You say also, سَكَتَ الحَرُّ,

may have both of these meanings; both being
agreeable with analogy]. (S, TA; in neither of
which it is explained.)

-A2-
اسكتهُ and ↓ سكّتهُ (S, A, Msb) both signify the
same, said of God (S) [and of a man]; He made
him, or rendered him, silent, mute, or speechless;
(Msb;) [he silenced, or hushed, him;] namely, a

-b2-  In

-b4-  Also A certain disease [by which a
person loses his powers of speech and motion],
(S, K, TA,) well known among the physicians;
(TA;) [i. e. apoplexy; thus called in the present
day:] accord. to some, the word in this sense
should be written ↓ سِكْتَةٌ, because it denotes a
mode [of silence or stillness]; but this is incorrect,
being at variance with the authority of transmission. (TA.) ―

سُكْتَةٌ: see سِكْتَةٌ. ―

and ↓ سَكْتَةٌ, meaning He has not any food with
which to silence, or quiet his family, or household. (Lh, TA.)

(Lh, TA.) ―
-b2-  See also سَكْتَةٌ.
سُكَاتٌ Constant, or continual, silence. (Msb.)
Hence, by way of comparison, one says, الإِفْحَامُ
سُكَاتٌ [as though meaning The state of being
silenced in a dispute, &c., is a state of constant,
or continual, silence: but it seems to mean, more
probably, الافحام (as an act. inf. n.) is an act
that silences; agreeably with what here follows].

المُجَلِّى, المُصَلِّى, المُسَلِّى, التَّالِى, المُرْتَاحُ, العَاطِفُ,
الحَظِىُّ, المُؤَمَّلُ, and اللَّطِيمُ. (TA.) Sb says that
سُكَيْتٌ is a contracted dim. of سُكَّيْتٌ; the uncontracted dim. of which is سُكَيْكِيتٌ. (TA.) ―
