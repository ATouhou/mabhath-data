سيرجQ. 1
سَمْرَجَةٌ [inf. n. of سَمْرَجَ] The collecting
of the [tax called] خَرَاج: (Ibn-'Abbád, O:) [and
the giving, or paying, thereof: for] one says,
سَمْرِجْ لَهُ, meaning Give thou to him [the tax so
called]. (ISh, O, K. [It seems to be intentionally indicated in the O and K, by what immediately precedes the explanation of this phrase,
which explanation is أَعْطِهِ, that الخَرَاجَ is to be
understood after it.])
سمرج [written without any syll. signs, and
therefore probably سَمْرَجْ,] sing. of سَمَارِجُ, (TA,)
which signifies Even, or plain, places [or tracts]
of land. (T, * Ibn-'Abbád, O, TA. *)
سَمَرَّجٌ and ↓ سَمَرَّجَةٌ, (S, O, K,) each a Pers.
word arabicized, (S, O,) [or rather a compound
of the Pers. سِهْ “ three ” and the Arabic مَرَّهْ for
مَرَّة “ a time,”] The levying of the [tax called]
خَرَاج at three several times [or instalments]: (S,
O, K:) or the name of the day on which payment of the خَرَاج is received; (K;) thus the
former word is expl. by ISh; (O;) the day of
the collecting of the خراج; (Ibn-'Abbád, ISd, O,
TA;) a day when the foreigners, or Persians,
(العَجَم) levy the خراج at three several times
[or instalments]: also mentioned as written with
ش. (TA.)
سَمَرَّجَةٌ: see the next preceding parapraph.
