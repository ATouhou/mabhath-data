encompassing the bottom thereof, so as to surround the back and other parts of the neck, and
the two cheeks, and to reach to the مَحْجِرَانِ

but when it [the helmet] is not of plate, or expanded metal, but is [a head-covering] of mail, it
is called مِغْفَرٌ and غِفَارَةٌ and تَسْبِغَةٌ: (TA:) [the
pl. is تَسَابِغُ:] and the helmet [that has a تَسْبِغَة
attached to it, accord. to those who mean by this
term the mail attached to the bottom thereof,] is
called ↓ سَابِغٌ: (JK:) or, accord. to As, one says
بَيْضَةٌ لَهَا سَابِغٌ, (S,) or لَهَا تَسَابِغُ. (K, TA: in the

مُسْبِغٌ, (S, A, L, TA,) in the O and K ↓ سُبُغٌ,
like عُنُقٌ, which seems to be a mistranscription,
copied by the author of the K, accord, to his
usual practice, from the O, (TA,) A man having
upon him a coat of mail such as is termed سَابِغَةٌ.
(S, A, O, L, K.)
