indicated by the context in the K, (TA,) by

وَسِحَافٌ They brought us bowls in which were
sorts of flesh-meat and of fat. (IAar K, * TA.)
سَحْفَةٌ A piece, or portion, of fat; in a general
sense: (TA:) or the portion of fat that is upon
the back, (S, K, TA,) sticking to the skin, in the
part between the two shoulder-blades, extending
to the haunches: so says ISk: (S, TA:) or that
is upon the two sides and the back: and it is
never but from fatness: accord. to IKh, it is in
all beasts except the camel: ISd says that, accord.
to some, it is in the camel [also]. (TA.) ―

-A2-  See
also سَحِيفٌ.
-A3-  [Freytag makes it to be also syn.
with مَسْحَفٌ, as on the authority of the K, in
which I do not find it in this sense.]
سُحَفَةٌ: see what next follows.
سُحَفْنِيَةٌ (in which the ن is augmentative, TA)
A man having the head shaven; (IB, K, TA;) as
also ↓ سُحَفَةٌ. (IB, TA.) ―

Having a portion of fat such as is termed سَحْفَة,
or two such portions of fat; as also ↓ أُسْحُوفٌ:

-b7-  In the K, three other meanings are erroneously assigned to this word; one of them
belonging to سَحِيفَةٌ, and each of the others to
سَحِيفٌ. (TA.)
سَحِيفٌ, (ISk, S, Sgh, TA,) accord. to the context in the K سَحُوفٌ, which is wrong, in this and
the next sense, (TA,) The sound of the mill when
one grinds. (ISk, S, Sgh, K *) And The sound
of the streaming of milk from the udder; (O, K, *
TA;) as also ↓ سَحْفَةٌ. (K, * TA.)
سَحِيفَةٌ The fat called سَحْفَةٌ that one has pared
off from the back of a sheep or goat. (ISk, S.)
―
-b2-  And sing. of سَحَائِفُ, (Lth, TA,) which signifirs The layers of fat between the layers [of flesh]
of the flanks: and similar wide portions of fat
that are seen adhering to the skin. (Lth, K,
TA.) ―
-b3-  Also A rain (مَطْرَةٌ) that sweeps away
that along which it passes: (S, O, L, TA:) in
the K, by the omission of كَسَفِينَةٍ, this meaning
is erroneously assigned to سَحُوفٌ: accord. to As,
a sharp rain, that sweeps away everything: and
سَحِيقَةٌ, with ق, a vehement rain, consisting of
large drops, but of little width: pls. سَحَائِفُ and
سَحَائِقُ. (TA.)
أُسْحُوفٌ: see سَحُوفٌ. ―
-b2-  أُسْحُوفُ الأَحَالِيلِ, (K,)
mentioned by ISh, on the authority of Aboo-Aslam, (TA,) and إِسْحَوْفُ الاحاليل, (K,) thus
accord. to Sb, (TA,) A she-camel wide in the
orifices of the teats: (Aboo-Aslam, K:) or having
much milk, the streaming of which causes a sound
to be heard. (Aboo-Málik, K, * TA.)
