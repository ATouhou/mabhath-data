Q. Q. 4
اِسْمَدَرَّ بَصَرُهُ His sight became weak,
in the manner described below, voce سَمَادِيرُ. (S
in art. سدر, and M and K in art. سمدر.) It is of
the measure اِفْمَعَلَّ, from السَّدَرُ; (IKtt;) the م
being augmentative. (S.) See also سَدِرَ. ―
-b2-
اسمدرّت عَيْنُهُ His eye shed tears; accord. to Lh;
but this is not known in the classical language.
(M in art. سمدر.)
سِدْرٌ [a coll. gen. n., The species of lote-tree
called by Linnæus rhamnus spina Christi; and
by Forskål, rhamnus nabeca;] the tree, or trees,
of which the fruit is called نَبِق and نَبْق: (S, M,
Mgh, Msb, K:) sing., (Msb,) or [rather] n. un.,
(S, M, K,) سِدْرَةٌ: (S, M, Msb, K:) and sometimes سِدْرٌ is used as meaning the smallest or
smaller of numbers [generally denoting from
three to ten inclusively]: (Ibn-Es-Sarráj, Msb:)
AHn says, accord. to Aboo-Ziyád, the سِدْر is of
the kind called عِضَاه, and is of two species, عُبْرِىٌّ
and ضَالٌ: the عبرى is that which has no thorns
except such as do not hurt: the ضال has thorns
[which hurt]: the سدر has a broad round leaf:
and sometimes people alight and rest beneath a
tree of this kind; but the ضال is small: the best
نبق that is known in the land of the Arabs is in
Hejer (هَجَر), in a single piece of land which is
appropriated to the Sultán alone: it is the sweetest of all in taste and odour: the mouth of him
who eats it, and the garments of him who has it
upon him, diffuse an odour like that of perfume:
(M, TA:) it is [also] said that the سدر is of two
species; whereof one grows in the cultivated lands,
and its leaves are used in the ablution termed
غُسْل, and its fruit is sweet; and the other grows
in the desert, and its leaves are not so used, and
its fruit is juicy: the زُعْرُور is so described that
it may be supposed to be the wild نبق: (Msb:)
when سِدْرٌ is used absolutely, with relation to the
ablution termed غُسْل, it means the ground leaves
of the tree so called: (Mgh, * Msb:) the pl. of
سِدْرَةٌ is سِدْرَاتٌ and سِدِرَاتٌ and سِدَرَاتٌ (S, K)
and سِدَرٌ (S, M, K) and سُدُورٌ, (M, K,) which
last is extr. (M.) ―
-b2-  سِدْرَةُ المُنْتَهَى is said to be
The lote-tree in the Seventh Heaven; (Lth, K; *)
beyond which neither angel nor prophet passes,
and which shades the water and Paradise: (Lth:)
in the Saheeh it is said to be in the Sixth
Heaven: 'Iyád reconciles the two assertions by
the supposition that its root is in the Sixth, and
that it rises over the Seventh: accord. to IAth, it
is in the furthest part of Paradise to which, as
its furthest limit, extends the knowledge of ancients
and moderns. (MF, TA.)
سَدَرٌ [see 1]. You say, فِى بَصَرِهِ سَدَرٌ, and
↓ سَمَادِيرُ, In his sight is a confusedness, so that he
does not see well. (A.) ―
-b2-  Some say that it signifies
An affection resembling vertigo, common to a
voyager upon the sea: or [simply] vertigo. (TA
in art. بقل.)
سَدِرٌ Having his eyes dazzled by a thing, so
that he turns away his face from it: or in a
state of confusion or perplexity, and unable to see
his right course: syn. مُتَحَيِّرٌ: (K:) as also ↓ سَادِرٌ:
(S, K:) and the former, a camel having his eyes
dazzled by a thing, so that he turns away his
face from it, by reason of intense heat: (S:) and
also one having his eyes dazzled by snow; as well
as by intense heat. (IAar.) ―
-b2-  عَيْنُهُ سَدِرَةٌ His
eye is confused in its vision, or dazzled, so that
he cannot see well. (A.) ―
-b3-  And سَدِرَةٌ means An
old and weak she-camel. (IAar, TA in art. سد.)
―
-b4-  Also سَدِرٌ The sea: (S, M, K:) one of the
[proper] names thereof; (S;) occurring only in a
poem of Umeiyeh Ibn-Abi-s-Salt: (M:) he says,
فَكَأَنَّ بِرْقِعَ وَالمَلَائِكُ حَوْلَهُ
سَدِرٌ تَوَاكَلُهُ القَوَائِمُ أَجْرَدُ
[And as though the first heaven, with the angels
around it, were the sea, the winds deserting it,
and smooth]: (S, M, TA: [but in the M and TA,
for حَوْلَهُ, we find حَوْلَهَا; and in the S, for أَجْرَدُ,
we find أَجْرَبُ, which is inconsistent with the
rhyme of the poem:]) by القوائم he means the
winds; and by تواكله, [for تَتَوَاكَلُهُ,] تَرَكَتْهُ [or
rather تَتْرُكُهُ]: he likens the sky to the sea when
calm: (TA:) Th quotes thus:
وَكَأَنَّ بِرْقِعَ وَالمَلَائِكُ تَحْتَهَا
سَدِرٌ تَوَاكَلُهُ قَوَائِمُ أَرْبَعُ
and says that the poet likens the angels, with
respect to their fear of God, to a man affected
with a vertigo [lit., turning round, though it
would seem more appropriate had he said, the
poet likens them to a camel so affected, whom
his four legs failed: he prefaces this explanation
with the words, سَدِرٌ يَدُورُ وَقَوَائِمُ أَرْبَعُ هُمُ المَلَائِكَةُ;
to which he or ISd adds, لَا يَدْرِى كَيْفَ خَلْقُهُم:
but (using a common phrase of ISd) I can only say,
لَا أَدْرِى كَيْفَ هٰذَا; unless there be some omission
in the transcription]: (M, TA:) Sgh says that
the correct reading is سِدْرٌ, meaning the kind of
tree so called, not the sea; and the author of the
Námoos adopts his opinion; but MF rejects it:
(TA:) some read رَقْعًا [in the place of برقع] and
explain it as meaning the seventh heaven. (TA
in art. رقع.)
سِدْرِىٌّ One who grinds and sells the leaves of
the سِدْر. (TA.) [See also سَدَّارٌ.]
سِدَارٌ A thing resembling a [curtain of the kind
called] خِدْر: (K:) or resembling a كِلَّة, which
is put across a [tent of the kind called] خِبَآء. (M.)
سَدَّارٌ A seller of the leaves of the سِدْر. (TA.)
[See also سِدْرِىٌّ.]
سَادِرٌ: see سَدِرٌ. ―
-b2-  Also Losing his way: you
say, إِنَّهُ سَادِرٌ فِى الغَىِّ Verily he is losing his way,
in error. (A.) And أَتَى أَمْرَهُ سَادِرًا i. e. [He
entered into, or did, his affair] in a wrong way.
(Ham p. 432.) ―
-b3-  A man without firmness, or
deliberation. (M.) You say, تَكَلَّمَ سَادِرًا He spoke
without deliberation. (A.) ―
-b4-  A man who cares
not for anything, nor minds what he does: (S, *
M, K:) or one who occupies himself with vain or
frivolous diversion. (TA.)
سُمْدُورٌ A cloudiness of the eye; (K;) and
weakness of sight: (TA:) and سَمَادِيرُ [originally
pl. of the preceding, app.,] weakness of sight, (S,
M, K,) or something appearing to a man by
reason of weakness of his sight, (M, K,) on the
occasion of, (S, M,) or [arising] from, (K,)
intoxication (S, M, K) by drink &c., (M,) and
from [or if the reading in the CK be correct this
prep. should be omitted] the insensibility arising
from drowsiness and vertigo. (S, K.) The م is
augmentative. (S: but the word is mentioned in
the M and K in art. سمدر.) See also سَدَرٌ.
-A2-
Also A king: because the eyes become weak,
or dazzled, in consequence of looking at him.
(K in art. سمدر.)
الأَسْدَرَانِ The shoulder-joints, (S, M, A, K,)
and the sides: (S, K:) or (so in the M, but
accord. to the K “ and ”) two veins (M, K) in
the eye, (M,) or in the two eyes: (K:) or beneath
the temples. (M.) Hence the saying جَآءَ يَضْرِبُ
أَسْدَرَيْهِ He came beating (with his hands, TA)
his shoulder-joints (S, A, K) and his sides; (S,
K;) meaning, (tropical:)  he came empty, (S, A, K,)
having nothing in his hand, (S,) or having no
occupation, (M,) and without having accomplished the object of his desire: (S, K:) and in
like manner, أَصْدَرَيْهِ: (S:) and جَآءَ يَنْفُضُ أَسْدَرَيْهِ,
(AZ,) and أَصْدَرَيْهِ, (TA,) and أَزْدَرَيْهِ, (ISk,) he
came shaking his shoulder-joints: (AZ:) or his
sides: meaning as above. (TA.)
مَسْدُورٌ Hair [let down, or made to hang down,
or] hanging down; like مَسْدُولٌ. (TA.)
مُسْمَدِرٌّ A dazzled eye. (TA in art. سمدر.)
-A2-
A long and direct road. (K ibid.) ―
-b2-  And hence,
(TA ibid.,) (assumed tropical:)  Right speech or language. (K and
TA ibid.)
