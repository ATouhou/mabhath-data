سدم1
سَدِمَ, (S, M, K,) aor.
سَدَمَ, (K,) inf. n. سَدَمٌ,
(S, M, K,) He repented and grieved: (S:) or he
was, or became, affected with anxiety: or with
anxiety together with repentance: or with wrath,
or rage, together with grief. (M, K.) [Hence,]
one says, مَا لَهُ هَمٌّ وَلَا سَدَمٌ إِلَّا ذَاكَ [He has no
object of anxiety nor of repentance and grief
except that: or this saying may be from what
next follows]. (S.) ―
-b2-  سَدِمَ بِالشَّىْءِ, aor. and
inf. n. as above, He desired the thing vehemently,
eagerly, greedily, very greedily, or excessively; hankered after it, or coveted it; and he was, or became,
devoted, addicted, or attached, to it: (TK:) [but
these meanings of the verb are perhaps only inferred
from the saying that] السَّدَمُ is syn. with الحِرْصُ:
and اللَّهَجُ بِالشَّىْءِ, (M, K, [in the CK اللَّهْجُ,]) and
الوُلُوعُ. (TA.) Hence the trad., مَنْ كَانَتِ الدُّنْيَا
هَمَّهُ وَسَدَمَهُ جَعَلَ اللّٰهُ فَقْرَهُ بَيْنَ عَيْنَيْهِ [To whomsoever the present state of existence is the object
of his anxiety and of his eager desire &c., God
places his poverty before his eyes]. (TA.)
-A2-

became altered [for the worse] by reason of long
standing, and overspread with [the green substance termed] طُحْلُب, and choked with dust
and other things that had fallen into it.

سَدِمٌ [is a part. n. of سَدِمَ: and is also app. used

Repenting and grieving: (TA:) or affected with
anxiety: or with anxiety together with repentance: or with wrath, or rage, together with

نَادِمٌ ↓ سَادِمٌ, and نَدْمَانُ ↓ سَدْمَانُ, [app. in like
manner,] السَّدَمُ being seldom used without النَّدَمُ:

stallion [camel] excited by lust for the female:
(S, M, K:) or one that is sent among the she-camels, and that brays amidst them, and, when
they have become excited by lust, is taken forth
from them, because what he begets is disesteemed;
(M, K, TA;) therefore, when he is excited by
lust, he is shackled, and pastures around the
dwelling; and if he attacks the she-camels, he is
muzzled: (TA:) or one that is in any manner
debarred from covering; (K;) or the last two
epithets have this last signification. (M.) ―

wind]: (M: [in the K and TA, erroneously,
مُنْدَفِقٌ:]) pl. أَسْدَامٌ [a pl. of pauc.] and سِدَامٌ [a
pl. of mult.]; or the sing. and pl. are alike; (M,
K;) [i. e.] you say مَآءٌ أَسْدَامٌ and سِدَامٌ, applying
pl. epithets to a sing. noun; (Z, TA;) as well as
مِيَاهٌ أَسْدَامٌ (IAmb, TA, and Ham p. 102) and
سِدَامٌ (IAmb, TA) meaning waters altered [for
the worse] (IAmb, TA, and Ham ubi suprà) in
consequence of long standing, and so سُدُمٌ: (Ham:)
this last is pl. of ↓ سَدُومٌ, as also سُدْمٌ: (M, TA:)
[and each of these two is also used as a sing.;
i. e.] you say also ↓ رَكِيَّةٌ سُدْمٌ and ↓ سُدُمٌ
meaning a well filled up, stopped up, or choked
up, with earth or dust; or into which the dust
has been swept by the wind: (S, K, TA: [in the
CK, مُنْدَفِقَةٌ is erroneously put for مُنْدَفِنَةٌ:]) or
into which varieties of small rubbish, and dust,
or small pebbles, whirled round by the wind, have
fallen, so that it is nearly choked up: (Lth,
TA:) and ↓ مَآءٌ سُدُمٌ is expl. as meaning water
that has become altered [for the worse]: (IAmb,
TA:) ↓ مُسَدَّمٌ, also, applied to water, signifies the
same as سَدِمٌ; (M, K;) and so does ↓ مَسْدُومٌ:

prevented from flowing by dust and wind. (Freytag, from the Deewán of Jereer.)]

Him, much, or frequently: for SM adds], hence
the saying,
لَا يَذْكُرُونَ اللّٰهَ إِلَّا سَدْمَا
[app. They remember not, or celebrate not, God,
otherwise than doing so much, or frequently:
from which it seems that one says, اللّٰهَ ↓ سَدَمَ,
