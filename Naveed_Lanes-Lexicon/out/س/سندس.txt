سندسسُنْدُسٌ Thin, or fine, دِيبَاج [or silk brocade]:
(Th, M, Bd and Jel in xviii. 30, Jel in xliv. 53,
Msb, K, TA:) or thin, or fine, حَرِير [q. v.]:
(Bd in xliv.:) opposed to إِسْتَبْرَقٌ: (TA:) or i. q.
بِزْيَوْنٌ [expl. by IB as meaning thin, or fine,
ديباج: so in the TA in art. بزن]: (S:) or a kind
of بزيون; (Lth, K, TA;) made of [the kind of
down called] مِرْعِزَّى: (Lth, TA:) or a kind of
بُرُود [pl. of بُرْدٌ, q. v.]: (M, K:) [accord. to
Golius, præstans et subtile panni serici genus;
as on the authority of Ibn-Maaroof: and Attalicus
pannus, aurum argentumve intextum habens;
as on the authority of J, who, however, explains
it only by the word بِزْيَوْنٌ: it is mentioned in the
S and Msb in art. سدس; and in the latter, is said
to be of the measure فُنْعُلٌ; but accord. to the
K, the ن is a radical letter:] it is [said to be] an
arabicized word, without contradiction, (Lth, K,)
as well as إِسْتَبْرَقٌ: (Lth:) but both these words
occur in the Kur-án, and Esh-Sháfi'ee and others
deny that any arabicized word occurs therein:
[though they are opposed by Bd (xvii. 37) and
others:] some say that they are instances of the
agreement of different languages. (MF.)
