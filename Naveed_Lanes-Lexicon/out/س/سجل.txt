signifying the writing of سِجِلَّات [pl. of سِجِلٌّ],
though not found by him in the lexicons: (Har
p. 473:) [but I have found it, for Sgh says,] the
إِسْجَال of the kádee and his تَسْجِيل are one [in
meaning]. (O.) You say, سجّل بِهِ He decided
it judicially, [and recorded it in the سِجِلّ;] or

bucket] the like of what the other brought forth
[or endeavouring to do so]; the one, of them, that

فُلَانًا (tropical:)  Such a one vies with such a one, each of
them producing, [of the evidences] of nobility, the
like of what the other produces; the one, of them,

مَنْ يُسَاجِلْنِى يُسَاجِلْ مَاجِدًا
يَمْلَأُ الدَّلْوَ إِلَى عَقْدِ الكَرَبْ
[He who contends for superiority with me contends for superiority with one possessing glory,
who fills the bucket to the tying of the rope that
is attacked to the middle of its cross-bars]: and
hence the saying, الحَرْبُ سِجَالٌ. (S. [See سَجْلٌ.])

تساجلوا They vied, competed, or contended

other. (K.)
7
انسجل It (water) poured out, or forth; or
became poured out, or forth; (S, K;) [app., continuously: see 1.]
سَجْلٌ A full bucket: so accord. to Az and ElFárábee and others: (MS:) or a bucket containing water, whether little or much: such as is
empty is not called سَجْلٌ nor ذَنُوبٌ: (S:) or a
great bucket: (Msb: [see also سَجِيلٌ:]) or a
great bucket that is full (K, TA) of water: (TA:)
and a bucketful; the quantity that fills a bucket:
(K:) it is of the masc. gender [though دَلْوٌ (the
most common word for “ a bucket ”) is generally
fem.]: (S, K:) pl. سِجَالٌ. (S.) ―
-b2-  And [hence,]
(assumed tropical:)  A share, or portion; (Msb;) like دَلَاةٌ [which
likewise originally signifies “ a bucket ”]. (S in
art. دلو. [See also سَجِيلٌ.]) And hence is derived
the saying, الحَرْبُ سِجَالٌ, [as though meaning
(assumed tropical:)  War is an affair of shares, or portions;] i. e.
the victory in war is shared by turns among the
people [engaged therein]: (Msb:) [but it is implied in the S that it is from المُسَاجَلَةُ, and that
سِجَالٌ is here an inf. n. like مُسَاجَلَةٌ, agreeably
with analogy; and if so, the saying may be
rendered war is a contention for superiority:
(see 3:)] or the saying الحَرْبُ بَيْنَهُمْ سِجَالٌ means
(assumed tropical:)  [War between them consists of portions, in such
a manner that] a سَجْل [or portion] thereof is
against these, and another is against these: (K:)
originating from the act of two men drawing
water with two buckets from a well, each of
them having [in his turn] a full bucket. (TA.)
You say also, أَعْطَاهُ سَجْلَهُ مِنْ كَذَا (tropical:)  He gave
him his share, or portion, of such a thing; like
as one says, ذَنُوبَهُ. (Har p. 19.) The phrase سَجْلٌ
↓ سَجِيلٌ in the saying لَهُمْ مِنَ المَجْدِ سَجْلٌ سَجِيلٌ
(K, * TA) has an intensive signification; (K,
TA;) [the saying app. meaning (assumed tropical:)  They have, of
glory, a large share.] ―
-b3-  Hence likewise, metaphorically applied to signify (tropical:)  A gift: one says
جَوَادٌ عَظِيمُ السَّجْلِ (tropical:)  [A bountiful man who is
large in gift]. (Har ibid. [The first word in this
saying is there written جوّاد.]) One says also,
لَهُ بِرٌّ فَائِضُ السِّجَالِ (assumed tropical:)  [He has overflowing goodness or beneficence]. (TA.) ―
-b4-  Also (assumed tropical:)  A bountiful man. (Abu-l-' Omeythil, K.) ―
-b5-  And (assumed tropical:)  A
great udder: pl. سِجَالٌ and سُجُولٌ. (K.)

above. (TA.)

سِجالِ,] is A call to the ewe to be milked. (Ibn-
'Abbád, O, K.)

means مِنْ سِجِلٍّ, i. e. of what had been written
[or decreed] for them, that they should be punished
therewith; and سِجِّيل means the same as سِجِّين,
mentioned and expl. in the Kur lxxxiii. 8 and 9:
(K:) AO says that من سجّيل means many and
hard; and that سِجِّينٌ is syn. with سِجِّيلٌ in this
sense: (TA:) it is also said to be from سِجِّينٌ
meaning Hell; the ن being changed into ل:
(Bd in xi. 84:) also, to be from أَسْجَلْتُهُ meaning “ I sent forth him or it: ” or from أَسْجَلْتُ
