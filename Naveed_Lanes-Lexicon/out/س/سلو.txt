[or] white [?], resembling the سُمَانَى, (M,) or like
the pigeon, but longer in the shank and neck than
the latter, and of a colour resembling that of the
سُمَانَى, quick in motion: accord. to Akh, the
word is used as sing. and pl.: (Msb:) [or] Akh
says, I have not heard any sing. thereof, and it
seems that the single one is thus called like the pl.
number, in like manner as دفْلَى is [said to be]
applied to one and to the pl. number: (S:) or
the n. un. is سَلْوَاةٌ; (M, K;) of which Lth cites
as an ex. this saying, [in which بَلَّلَهُ should be
بَلَّلَهَا,]

-b2-  السَّلْوَى signifies [also] Whatever renders
thee forgetful, or content, or happy, in a case of
privation; (كُلُّ مَا سَلَّاكَ, M, K;) and honey

given [in water] to drink to a man, and renders
him forgetful, or content, or happy, in a case of
privation: (M, K: *) or a pebble upon which
water is poured and given to drink to a man, who
thereupon becomes forgetful, or content, or happy,
in a case of privation: (M:) Ru-beh says,
لَوْ أَشْرَبُ السُّلْوَانَ مَا سَلِيتُ
مَابِى غِنًى عَنْكِ وَإِنْ غَنِيتُ
(S, M, *) and Nuseyr Ibn-Abee-Nuseyr, in answer
to a question of As respecting the meaning of
السلوان, said that it is a bead (خَرَزَةٌ) which is
bruised, or pulverized, [and upon which water is
then poured,] the water of which occasions in the
drinker thereof forgetfulness, or content, or happiness, in a case of privation: but As disallowed
this, and said that it is an inf. n. of سَلَوْتُ, and
that the meaning is لَوْ أَشْرَبُ السُّلُوَّ [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  Were I
made to drink forgetfulness, &c., I should not
become forgetful, &c.: there is not in me freedom
from want of thee, though I be free from want of
others]. (TA.) See also سَلْوَةٌ.

freedom from, anxieties]: like مُعْلَاةٌ [in form].
(TA.)
