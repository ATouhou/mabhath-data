(S,) It (a thing, M) prevailed against him, or

K:) these two are said to be the only verbs of
this measure: (TA:) [but several others should
be added; as اِعْلَنْدَى and اِكْلَنْدَى and اِغْلَنْتَى:]
the ى in اسرندى [and the like] is to render it
quasi-coordinate to [quadriliteral-radical verbs of
the measure] اِفْعَنْلَلَ. (S.) A rájiz says,
قَدْ جَعَلَ النُّعَاسُ يَغْرَنْدِينِى
أَطْرُدُهُ عَنِّى وَيَسْرَنْدِينِى
[Drowsiness was beginning to prevail against
me; I driving it from me, and it overcoming me].

of أَطْرُدُهُ.)
سَرْدٌ inf. n. of 1 [q. v.]. (S, M, &c.) [Hence,]
وَقَدِّرْ فِى السَّرْدِ, in the Kur xxxiv. 10, means And
do thou make a due adaptation of the rings in
the fabrication of the coats of mail: (Bd, Jel:)
or and do thou properly adapt the nails, or pins,
and the holes of the rings, [in the fabrication,]
not making the former thick and the latter small,
nor the reverse: (M, Bd, * L:) or السَّرْد means
السَّمْر [i. e. the nailing, or the making firm, or
fast, with nails], (Zj, M, L,) in this instance.
(Zj, L.)
-A2-  Also (assumed tropical:)  Coats of mail; (S, M, L, K;)
a gen. n. in this sense: (S, K:) [and a single
coat of mail; like زَرْدٌ and زَرَدٌ:] and (tropical:)  any other
حَلَق [properly signifying rings, but here meaning
mail]; (S, A, K;) [i. e.] it signifies also the like
of coats of mail, made of حَلَق: (M, L:) [said to
be] so called because the two extremities of each
ring are perforated by the nail, or pin; and these
rings are [termed] ↓ المُسْرَدُ: (L:) [if so, the word
is an inf. n. used in the sense of a pass. part. n.,]
see مَسْرُودٌ, [and then as a subst.; and, being
originally an inf. n., it is used alike as sing. and
pl.; or, as Z says,] it is an inf. n. used as a subst.:
(A:) or السَّرْدُ, as some say, means السَّمْرُ, [as
mentioned above,] and ↓ السَّرَدُ means الحَلَقُ [like
الزَّرَدُ]. (M.)
-A3-  Also (tropical:)  Consecutive, or following

that are consecutive: the epithet retaining the
masc. sing. form, though applied to a pl. subst.,
because originally an inf. n.; like عَدْلٌ in the
phrase رِجَالٌ عَدْلٌ]. (A.) So too as an epithet
applied to three of the sacred months, in the saying, ثَلَاثَةٌ سَرْدٌ وَوَاحِدٌ فَرْدٌ [Three are consecutive
and one is separate]: (A:) thus an Arab of the
desert answered when asked if he knew the sacred
months: (S, M, Msb:) the سرد are Dhu-l-Kaadeh
and Dhu-l-Hijjeh and El-Moharram, and the فرد
is Rejeb. (S, M.)

سَرَادٌ Hard green dates: (K:) and dates that
are injured by want of water, (K, TA,) and
consequently dry up before ripening: (TA:) or
unripe dates that drop before attaining to maturity, while green: n. un. with ة: (AHn, M, TA:)
or the latter signifies a date that becomes sweet
before it becomes coloured, being such as is termed
a بَلَحَة. (M, TA.) [See بُسْرٌ.]

رَمِيدَنْ Pavidum fugacemque esse,” as on the
authority of the KL, are mistranscriptions for
شِرَادٌ and شُرُودٌ, which I find thus expl. in the
KL.]

brave, or courageous: (M:) and quick in his
affairs: (K:) or a man who goes on, or advances,
boldly; derived from السَّرْدُ: (Sb, TA:) [accord.
to Sb, therefore, this is its proper art; but
accord. to the K, its proper art. is سرند, in which
F mentions it again: it is perfectly decl., i. e.,
with tenween, for] the fem, is سَرَنْدَاةٌ. (S, TA.)
―
-b2-  Also A sword that penetrates the thing that
it strikes. (L.)
سَارِدٌ: see سَرَّادٌ.

instrument with which leather is sewed; (S;)
syn. مِخْرَزٌ; (M, L, Msb;) or إِشْفًى; which is
[said to be] the same thing as the مِخْرَز; (L;) as
also ↓ سَرِيدٌ: (K:) or an [instrument of the kind
called] إِشْفًى that has a hole at its extremity;
(A;) and so ↓ سَرِيدٌ and ↓ سَرَادٌ. (TA: [but the
last I think a mistake for سِرَاد.]) ―

(A,) (tropical:)  He is the son of a female slave: (A, K:)
because she is a sewer of skins, or leather: (A:)
an expression of vituperation. (K.) ―

likewise,] مِسْرَدٌ also signifies (tropical:)  The tongue. (M,
A.) So in the saying, فُلَانٌ يَخْرِقُ الأَعْرَاضَ بِمِسْرَدِهِ
(tropical:)  [Such a one wounds reputations with his tongue].
(A.)
-A2-  Also A sandal having its لِسَان [or

leather or skin carried on in regular and uninterrupted order]. (S. [In one of my copies of
the S, I find خَرَز in the place of خَرْز; and so in
