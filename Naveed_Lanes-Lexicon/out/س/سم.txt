the K, by a mistranscription (وَالسَّمِّ or وَالسُّمِّ for
والسَّمُّ or وَالسُّمُّ) سَمٌّ or سُمٌّ is made to be syn. with
سَمْسَمٌ as signifying “ a fox. ” That the right
reading is that which I have followed is shown in

دِفْلَى [q. v.]. (K.) ―
-b4-  And سَمُّ السَّمَكِ The tree
called مَاهِيزَهْرَهْ [or مَاهِى زَهْرَهْ], (K,) which latter
appellation is Pers., meaning the same, [i. e.
“ fish-poison,”] (TA,) and also known by the name
of البُوصِيرُ: it is beneficial for pains of the joints,
and pain of the hip and the back, and the نِقْرِس
[i. e. gout, or specially gout in the foot or feet];
but the only part of its tree that is beneficial is
its لِحَآء [or bark]: (K, TA:) when somewhat
thereof, (K, * TA,) kneaded mith leaven, (TA,)
is put into a pool of water, it intoxicates the fish
thereof, (K, TA,) so that they float upon the
surface of the water: (TA:) and its leaves burn

mouth and his nostrils and his ears; (K;) and
the sing. is سَمٌّ and ↓ سُمٌّ: (S:) or the سُمُوم of a
human being, and of a horse or the like, are the
clefts (مَشَاقّ) of the skin thereof. (M.) And the
سُمُوم of the horse are The thin portions of the
hard bone, [extending] from the two sides of the
nasal bone to the channels of the tears: sing. سَمٌّ:
(M:) or, as some say, (M,) the سَمَّانِ, (S, M,)

is knowing, or skilful, in respect of the object of
his aim or pursuit]. (M.) ―
-b3-  [And hence, perhaps, though another derivation is asserted in
what follows,] one says also, مَالَهُ سَمٌّ وَلَا حَمٌّ غَيْرُكَ
and وَلَا حُمٌّ ↓ سُمٌّ, (S, M,) meaning (assumed tropical:)  He has no
object in his mind except thee; syn. هَمٌّ: (M:)
and in like manner, مَالَهُ سَمٌّ وَلَا حَمٌّ and وَلَا ↓ سُمٌّ
حُمٌّ [alone]: or, accord. to Fr, it means he has
not any who hopes for him: this is from [سَمَمْتُ
سَمَّكَ and] حَمَمْتُ حَمَّكَ and هَمَمْتُ هَمَّكَ meaning

or, accord. to the same and Meyd, birds like

respecting it, as has been shown voce حَرُورٌ;

sometimes in the night; and the حَرُور is in the
night, and sometimes in the day: (S:) but some
say that the former is in the night, and the latter

Egyptian deserts usually proceeding from the
south-east or south-south-east, gradually darkening the air to a deep purple hue, whether or not

expressed;] (S, K; [by the author of the latter
of which, this was evidently understood to be
different from the جُلْجُلَان, which is mentioned
by him after the description of properties here
following;]) it is glutinous, corruptive to the
stomach and the mouth; but is rendered good by
honey; and when it is digested, it fattens; and
the washing of the hair with the water in which
its leaves have been cooked lengthens and improves
it: the wild sort thereof is known by the name of
جَلْبَهَنْك, (K, TA,) thus, with fet-h to the ج and

written in the CK جَلْبَهَنَكْ,] a Pers. word, [originally جلْبَهَنْگ,] arabicized; (TA;) its action is
nearly like that of the خَرْبَق [or hellebore]; and
sometimes from half a drachm to a drachm is
