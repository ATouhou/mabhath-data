سَرَاوِيل a Pers. word, (S, * M, Msb, * K,) originally شَلْوَار, (MA, KL, [in the former loosely
expl. by the word إِزَارٌ, and so in the PS,]) of
well-known meaning, (S,) [Drawers, trousers, or
breeches; originally applied to such as are worn
under other clothing;] a certain under-garment;
(MA;) [but now applied also to such as are worn
externally;] is masc. [and perfectly decl., i. e.
with tenween], and fem. [and imperfectly decl., i. e.
without tenween]; (S, M, Msb, K; *) sometimes
masc., (Msb, K,) but not known to As otherwise
than as fem.; (M;) accord. to the usage most
commonly obtaining, it is imperfectly decl. and
fem.: (MF:) Sb says that it is a sing., and is a
foreign, or Pers., word, arabicized; resembling,
in their [the Arabs'] language, what is imperfectly decl. [as a pl. of the measure فَعَالِيلُ] when
determinate and when indeterminate; but is perfectly decl. when indeterminate; and imperfectly
decl. if applied as a proper name to a man, and
so is its dim. if so applied, because it is fem. and
of more than three letters: (S:) or it is imperfectly decl. as a proper name because it is also
originally a foreign word; and its dim., ↓ سُرَيْيِيل,
[for سُرَيْوِيل, the و being changed into ى, as in
سَيِّدٌ for سَيْوِدٌ,] is perfectly decl. unless used as a
proper name, in which latter case it is imperfectly
decl. [for the reason above mentioned or] because
it is fem. and determinate: (IB, TA:) it (i. e.
سَرَاوِيل) is made, as a pl., imperfectly decl. when
indeterminate by some of the grammarians; (S;)
and it occurs in poetry imperfectly decl. [when
indeterminate]: (S, M, * IB, TA:) [but this may
be by poetic license:] thus in the saying of Ibn-Mukbil,
أَتَى دُونَهَا ذَبُّ الرِّيَادِ كَأَنَّهُ
فَتًى فَارِسِىٌّ سَرَاوِيلَ رَامِحُ
[The came as an obstacle intervening in the way
to her, or them, the wild bull, as though he were
a Persian youth in drawers; one with a pair of
horns]: (S, * IB, TA:) the former [however] is
the usual way, [contrary to what has been said
on the authority of MF,] though the latter is
more valid: (S:) the pl. is سَرَاوِيلَاتٌ: (S, M,
Msb, K:) Sb says that it has no broken pl.,
because, if it had, it would be the same as the
sing.: (M:) or, (K,) some say, (S, M, Msb,)
namely those grammarians who make it imperfectly decl. when indeterminate, (S,) holding it
to be [originally] an Arabic word, (Msb,) it is a
pl. of which the sing. is ↓ سِرْوَالَةٌ (S, M, Msb, K)
and ↓ سِرْوَالٌ (S, K) and ↓ سِرْوِيلٌ, which is [said
to be] the only instance of a word of the measure
فَعْوِيلٌ: (K:) [this, therefore, confirms the opinion that I hold, that the measure of this word is
فِعْلِيلٌ, and that all the words of the present art.
are quadriliteral-radical, agreeably with an assertion in the TA that سرل is not genuine Arabic:
though it seems that all the lexicographers regard
the و in the words of this art. as augmentative:]
a poet says,
فَلَيْسَ يَرِقُّ لِمُسْتَعْطِفِ * ↓ عَلَيْهِ مِنَ اللُّؤْمِ سِرْوَالَةٌ
[Upon him is an under-garment of ignobleness,
(i. e. ignobleness cleaves to him like a pair of
drawers,) so that he does not become tenderhearted to one who endeavours to conciliate him]:
(S, * M:) in the “ Mujarrad,” سَرَاوِيلُ is made
fem., and ↓ سِرْوَالٌ masc.: (Msb:) سَرَاوِين is a
dial. var.; (K;) or syn. with سَرَاوِيل; the ن in
the former being asserted by Yaakoob to be a
substitute for the ل [in the latter]: (M:) and
شِرْوَالٌ, with ش, is likewise a dial. var. [of سِرْوَالٌ],
(K,) mentioned by Es-Sijistánee, on the authority of some one or more of the Arabs: (TA:)
[the common modern pronunciation is شَرْوَال: pl.
شَرَاوِيل.]
سُرَيْيِيل: dim. of سَرَاوِيل, q. v. (IB, TA.)
مُسَرْوَلٌ Clad with سَرَاوِيل; as also ↓ مُتَسَرْوِلٌ.
(A, TA.) ―

plumage clothes its legs. (M, L, TA.) And
حَمَامَةٌ مُسَرْوَلَةٌ (tropical:)  A pigeon having feathers upon
its legs. (S, K, TA.) And فَرَسٌ مُسَرْوَلٌ, (K,) or
فَرَسٌ أَبْلَقُ مُسَرْوَلٌ, (A'Obeyd, S, TA,) (tropical:)  [A horse,
or a black and white horse,] whose whiteness
of the legs extends (A'Obeyd, S, K) beyond,
(A'Obeyd, K, TA,) or to, (S,) the arms and
thighs: (A'Obeyd, S, K:) or مُسَرْوَلٌ applied to
a horse means white in the hinder part, [and
black, or of some other colour, in the hind legs,]
the whiteness descending to the thighs. (A, voce
آزَرُ.) ―
-b3-  And المُسَرْوَلُ signifies (assumed tropical:)  The wild bull:
because of the blackness that is in his legs. (Az,
TA.)
