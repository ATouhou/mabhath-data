or, accord. to some,
سَلِفَ, and accord. to IKtt, سَلَفٌ

In a verse cited voce سَلْفَ رَدَادٌ is used by poetic
license for سَلَفَ: but this kind of contraction is
allowed by the Basrees only in verbs of which
the medial radical letter is with kesr or damm, as
in عَلْمَ for عَلِمَ, and كَرْمَ for كَرُمَ. (M. [See
سَرُعَ.]) ―

trans. verb; the former explaining it as signifying
“ Præteriit, præcessit, rem; ” and the latter adding
“ tempore,” and assigning to it the inf. ns. سَلْفٌ
and سُلُوفٌ; as on the authority of the K; in
which I find no indication of such a usage of this
verb.]

سَلُفَ, inf. n.
سَلْفٌ; (S, M;) and ↓ اسلفها; (M, K;) He turned

competed, with him in going or running, in the
land; as though striving to be before him]. (Ibn-
'Abbád, K.) ―

affair. (Ibn-'Abbád, K.)
4
اسلفهُ He did it previously, or beforehand.
(O and TA in art. زلف.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] اسلف فِى,
كَذَا, (S, Mgh, Msb, TA,) inf. n. إِسْلَافٌ; (TA;)

(assumed tropical:)  He did to him, to be requited it, a good action
and an evil action; as is shown by the words
مَا أَسْلَفْتَ مِنْ إِسَآءَةٍ أَوْ إِحْسَانٍ وَمَا تُعْطِيهِ لِتُقْضَاهُ

also ↓ سَلِيفٌ and ↓ سُلْفَةٌ and ↓ سَلُوفٌ; all quasipl. ns.; (M;) of which the sing. is ↓ سَالِفٌ: (M,
Msb: *) or such as have gone before, or preceded,
of a man's ancestors (S, K) and of his relations,
(K,) that are above him in age and in excellence;
[but this addition is not always agreeable with
usage;] one of whom is termed ↓ سَالِفٌ: (TA:)
the pl. of سَلَفٌ is أَسْلَافٌ and سُلَّافٌ, (S, K,) [the
former a pl. of pauc. and the latter of mult.,] or
the latter is pl. of ↓ سَالِفٌ, and so is سَلَفٌ [said to
be, though this is more properly termed, as it is
in the M, a quasi-pl. n.]: (IB, Msb, TA:) and,
accord. to Zj, سُلُفٌ is pl. of ↓ سَلِيفٌ, and سُلَفٌ is
pl. of ↓ سُلْفَةٌ, which means a company (عُصْبَةٌ)
that has passed away: (M:) or ↓ سَالِفٌ and
↓ سَلِيفٌ signify the same; going before; preceding; syn. مُتَقَدِّمٌ. (S.) [Accord. to Abu-lMahásin, السَّلَفُ is particularly applied to 'Áïsheh
the wife of Mohammad, the three Khaleefehs
Aboo-Bekr and 'Omar and 'Othmán, Talhah and
Ez-Zubeyr, the Khaleefeh Mo'áwiyeh, and 'Amr
Ibn-El-Ás. (De Sacy's Chrest. Ar., sec. ed.,
i. 156.)] And السَّلَفُ الصَّالِحُ is applied to the
first chief persons of the Tábi'ees. (TA.) And
السَّلَفُ المُقَدَّمُ is an appellation of the prophet
Mohammad. (Ham p. 780.) [Hence, مَذَاهِبُ
السَّلَفِ The tenets of the early Muslims.] ―
-b2-  Also
A people, or party, going before, or preceding, in
journeying. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And [simply] A company
of men; as in the saying, جَآءَنِى سَلَفٌ مِنَ النَّاسِ
[A company of men came to me]. (M.) ―
-b4-  And
Any good, or righteous, deed, that one has done
beforehand [by way of preparing a future reward]: or any فَرَط [i. e. cause of reward, or
recompense, in the world to come, such as a child
dying in infancy], that [as it were] goes before
one. (A 'Obeyd, O, K.) ―
-b5-  And i. q. سَلَمٌ; (T,
Hr, Mgh, O, K, TA;) i. e. Any money, or property, paid in advance, or beforehand, as the
price of a commodity for which the seller has
become responsible and which one has bought on
description: (T, TA:) or payment for a commodity to be delivered at a certain [future]
period with something additional to [the equivalent of] the current price at the time of such payment; this [transaction] being a cause of profit
to him who makes such payment; and سَلَمٌ also
has this meaning: (TA:) or a sort of sale in
which the price is paid in advance, and the commodity is withheld, on the condition of description, to a certain [future] period: (S, O:) it is
a subst. from الإِسْلَافُ. (Msb, * K, TA.) ―
-b6-  And
A loan (قَرْضٌ) in which is no profit (Hr, O,
Mgh, K, TA) to the lender (Hr, O, K, TA)
except recompense [in the world to come] and
thanks, (TA,) and which it is incumbent on the
recipient thereof to return as he received it: (Hr,
O, K, TA:) thus the Arabs term it: (Hr, O,
TA:) and in this sense also the word is a subst.
from الإِسْلَافُ. (TA.)
-A2-  Also A stallion-camel.
(IAar, M, TA.)
-A3-  Also, (M,) or ↓ سُلْفَةٌ, (O,
TA,) The prepuce of a boy; (M, O, TA;) so
says Lth; (O, TA;) and ↓ سَلِفٌ and ↓ سِلْفٌ
signify the same; for this is meant by الجِلْدُ as
an explanation of السَّلِفُ and السِّلْفُ in the K, in
some copies of which الخُلْدُ is erroneously put
for الجِلْدُ. (TA.)
سَلِفٌ and ↓ سِلْفٌ The husband of the sister of
the wife of a man: (S, K:) and [the duals]
سَلِفَانِ (M, TA) and ↓ سِلْفَانِ (M, K) signify the
two husbands of two sisters: (M, K:) accord. to
IAar, the epithet سَلِفَةٌ [or ↓ سِلْفَةٌ] is not applied
to a woman; (M;) one only uses the term سَلِفَانِ
applied to two men: (M:) or, (M, K,) accord. to
Kr, سَلِفَتَانِ, (M,) or ↓ سِلْفَتَانِ, (K,) is applied to
the two wives of two brothers: (M, K:) [in the
present day, ↓ سِلْفَةٌ is used as meaning a woman's
husband's sister, and her brother's wife:] the pl.
applied to men is أَسْلَافٌ, (M, K, TA,) and that
applied to women is سَلَفٌ. (TA.)

[n. un. of قَطًا, q. v.]: (M:) AA says that he had
not heard سُلَفَةٌ, applied to the female; but if one
said سُلَفَةٌ, like as one says سُلَكَةٌ as meaning a
single female of what are termed سِلْكَانِ, it would
be approvable: (S:) the pl. is سِلْفَانِ (S, M, K)
and سُلْفَانٌ: (M, K:) some say that سِلْفَانٌ signifies
a species of bird, not particularized. (M.) [See
also سُلَحٌ and سُلَكٌ.]
سُلْفَةٌ: see سَلَفٌ, first sentence, in two places.
[Hence,] one says, جَاؤُوا سُلْفَةً سُلْفَةً, meaning

the portion that flows without its being expressed:
or the first that descends, thereof: (M:) or the
clearest, or purest, and most excellent, of wine,
such as flow from the grapes without their being
pressed, and without steeping, or maceration;
(T, TA;) and in like manner, such as flows from
dates, (T, TA,) and from raisins, before water
has been added to it (T, M, * TA) after the exuding
of the first thereof; (T, TA:) or the latter signifies the first that is expressed, of anything: (M:)
or it has this meaning also: and the former is a
name for wine [absolutely]: (S:) or each has this
meaning: (K:) or each signifies the clear, or
pure, of wine, and of anything. (M.) ―
-b2-  سُلَافُ
العَسْكَرِ: see سَالِفٌ.

وَالقُرُونِ السَّوَالِفِ [That was in the time of the
preceding peoples, and the preceding generations]:
the pl. in this instance being used because every
portion of the قرون is termed سَالِفَةٌ. (TA.)
[Hence also,] العَسْكَرِ سُلَّافٌ, in the K, by implication, العسكر ↓ سُلَافُ, the former word like

the term سالفة is made applicable to every part
thereof, and then the pl. is used accordingly.

the O with إِلَى in the place of فِيهَا.)
مِسْلَفَةٌ An instrument with which land is made
even, (S, M, O, K, TA,) of stone: A 'Obeyd says,
I think it is a stone made round [or cylindrical,
i. e. a stone roller,] which is rolled upon the land
