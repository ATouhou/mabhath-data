سمك1
سَمَكَ, [aor.
سَمُكَ,] inf. n. سُمُوكٌ, It (a thing)
rose, or became high or elevated or lofty. (S,
K.) ―
-b2-  And, aor. and inf. n. as above, He ascended. (TA.) One says, اُسْمُكْ فِى الرَّيْمِ Ascend
thou the stairs. (S, TA. [See رَيْمٌ.])
-A2-  And
سَمَكَهُ, (S, K,) aor. as above, (TA,) inf. n. سَمْكٌ,
He raised, elevated, upraised, or uplifted, it. (S,
K.) So in the phrase, سَمَكَ اللّٰهُ السَّمَآءَ [God

سَمْكٌ The roof of a house, or chamber: (S,
Mgh, * K: *) or the interior uppermost part [i. e.
the ceiling] of a house, or chamber; the exterior
uppermost part thereof being called صَهْوَةٌ: (Ham
p. 725:) or [the height] from the top to the
bottom of a house or chamber. (K.) [And
hence, The canopy of the heaven or sky: or] the
measure of the height of the heaven from the
earth: or the thickness thereof, upwards. (Bd in
lxxix. 28.) And The stature, or height in a
standing posture, or anything: (K:) thus expl.
by Lth: one says بِعِيرٌ طَوِيلُ السَّمْكِ [A camel tall
of stature]. (TA.) [In the present day, it signifies The extent of anything from top to bottom;
its height, depth, and thickness: and is vulgarly
pronounced سُمْك.]
سَمَكٌ Fish; syn. حُوتٌ; (K;) a kind of aquatic
creatures: [a coll. gen. n.:] n. un. with ة: pl. of
the former سِمَاكٌ and سُمُوكٌ. (S, TA.) شَوَى
فِى الحَرِيقِ سَمَكَتَهُ [He broiled his fish in the fire
of a burning house] is a post-classical prov. of the
people of Baghdád, relating to the concealing,
disguising, or cloaking, of a fault, for the purpose
of seizing an opportunity; orginating from the
fact that the thief used, when he saw the fire of a
burning house in a place, to go thither for the
purpose of theft; and if it were in his power, he
did what he desired; and if he were lighted on,
he said, I came to broil a fish. (Mtr, in Har
pp. 481-2.) ―
-b2-  السَّمَكَةُ [is a name of (tropical:)  The constellation Pisces; also called السَّمَكَتَانِ;] a certain
sign of the Zodiac; (K, TA;) thought by ISd to
be so called because it is a watery sign; and also
called الحُوتُ. (TA.)
سِمَاكٌ A thing with which a thing is raised,
elevated, upraised, or uplifted; (K, TA;) whether
a wall or a roof: (TA:) pl. سُمُكٌ. (K.)
-A2-
السِّمَاكَانِ is the name of Two bright stars;
السِّمَاكُ الأَعْزَلُ and السِّمَاكُ الرَّامِحُ: (S, O, K:) the
former is a star [namely a] in Virgo, called by
astrologers السُّنْبُلَةُ [or Spica Virginis]; (Kzw;)
and is one of the Mansions of the Moon, (S, O,
and Kzw in his descr. of the Mansions of the
Moon,) the Fourteenth thereof; (Kzw ibid.;) it
is one of the أَنْوَآء [pl. of نَوْءٌ, q. v.], and rises
aurorally in تِشْرِينُ الأَوَّلُ [October, O. S.; its
auroral rising, in Central Arabia, about the commencement of the era of the Flight, began on the
4th of that month]; it is called الا عزل because it
has no star [near] before it, like the اعزل that has
with him no spear; or, as some say, because,
when it rises [aurorally], it is not accompanied
by wind nor by cold: (TA:) the latter سِمَاك, i. e.
الرَّامِحُ, [thus called for a reason expl. in art. رمح,
q. v., is the star Arcturus, and] is not of the
Mansions of the Moon, (S, O, TA,) and has not
any نَوْء [here meaning supposed influence in
bringing rain &c.]; it is towards the north; the
former being towards the south; (TA;) and is
also called السِّمَاكُ المِرْزَمُ: (AZ, TA in art. رمح:)
[it is erroneously said that] the سماكان are in
the sign of Libra: (TA:) and it is said that they
are the two kind legs of Leo (رِجْلَا الأَسَدِ): (S, O,
K: *) [for it appears, as I have before observed,
(voce ذِرَاعٌ,) that the ancient Arabs, or many of
them, extended the figure of Leo (as they did
also that of Scorpio) far beyond the limits which
we assign to it: and hence,] السماك الا عزل was
also called سَاقُ الأَسَدِ [the thigh, or the hind
shank, of Leo]. (Kzw in his descr. of Virgo.)
The rhyming-proser says, إِذَا طَلَعَ السِّمَاكْ ذَهَبَ
العِكَاكْ فَأَصْلِحْ فِنَاكْ وَأَجِدَّ حِذَاكْ فَإِنَّ الشِّتَآءَ قَدْ أَتَاكْ
[When السماك rises aurorally, (i. e. السماك الا عزل,)
the sultriness has gone, therefore do thou put thy
court, or yard, in good condition, and renew thy
sandal, for the winter has come to thee: فِنَاك and
حِذَاك being contractions of فِنَآءَك and حِذَآءَك, for
the sake of the rhyme]. (O, TA.) The نَوْء [here
app. meaning the rain consequent upon the
auroral setting] of السماك الاعزل [about the 4th
of April, O. S. in Central Arabia] is abundant,
but disapproved, because it gives growth to the
نَشْر [q. v.], which diseases the camels that pasture
upon it. (Kzw in his descr. of the Mansions of
the Moon.) [The epithet ↓ سِمَاكِىٌّ is applied to
the rain above mentioned.] ―
-b2-  السِّمَاكُ also signifies, (K,) or سِمَاكُ التَّرْقُوَةِ, (Ibn-'Abbád, O,) The
upper part of the chest, next to the collar-bone.
(Ibn-'Abbád, O, K.)
سِمَاكِىٌّ: see the next preceding paragraph.
سُمَيْكَآءُ i. q. حُسَاسٌ; (S, O, K;) i. e. Certain
small fish, which are dried; also called هِفٌّ.
(O, TA.)
سَمَّاكٌ A fishmonger. (MA.)
سَنَامٌ سَامِكٌ A high, (S, TA,) or long and high,
and plump, (TA,) camel's hump. (S, TA.) ―
-b2-
شَرَفُكَ تَامِكٌ وَإِقْبَالُكَ سَامِكٌ (tropical:)  [Thy nobility is lofty,
and thy good fortune is high]. (A and Ta in
art. تمك.)
المُسْمَكَاتُ The heavens; (K;) which are seven
in number: (TA:) or so ↓ المَسْمُوكَاتُ: (S:) or
this is wrong; or it is a dial. var.: (K:) the latter
word is used by the vulgar, but is correct. (TA.)
مِسْمَاكٌ A pole of a [tent such as is called] خِبَآء,
(S, K,) which latter is raised thereby. (S.)
مَسْمُوكٌ Tall; (IDrd, O, K;) applied to a man.
(IDrd, O.) ―
-b2-  And, applied to a horse, [من الحَبْلِ
in the CK being a mistake for مِنَ الخَيْلِ,]
(tropical:)  Firm (Ibn-'Abbád, Z, O, K, TA) in the [ribs
called] جَوَانِح. (Z, TA.) ―
-b3-  المَسْمُوكَاتُ: see
المُسْمَكَاتُ.
بَيْتٌ مُسْتَمِكٌ and ↓ مُنْسَمِكٌ A tall house or tent.
(TA.)
مُنْسَمِكٌ: see what next precedes.
