سَدَنَ, (S, L, K,) aor.
سَدُنَ, (S, L,) inf. n. سَدْنٌ
and سِدَانَةٌ, [or the latter, accord. to the Msb,

The ministry, or service, of the Kaabeh, (Mgh,
L,) and the superintendence thereof, and the
opening and locking of its door. (L.) The
سِدَانَة and the لِوَآء [q. v.] belonged to [the family
named] Benoo-'Abd-ed-Dár in the Time of Ignorance, and the Prophet confirmed it to them
in El-Islám: (S, L:) [in the first age of ElIslám,] the سدانة of the Kaabeh belonged to the
sons of 'Othmán Ibn-Talhah [of the family of
Benoo-'Abd-ed-Dár]. (Mgh.) السِّدَانَةُ signifies
[also (L)] الحِجَابَةُ [which seems to be properly
a subst., meaning The office of door-keeper, or
chamberlain, but here seems, from the context, to
be used as an inf. n., meaning the performing
that office]: you say, سَدَنَهُ, aor. as above, [app.
meaning He acted as door-keeper, or chamberlain,
to it, namely a temple, or for him:] (M, L:) or
سَدَنَهُ, inf. n. سِدَانَةٌ, signifies he served it, or him.

like سَدَلَهُ [which is held by some to be the

أَسْدَانٌ is a dial. var. of أَسْدَالٌ signifying the

of the House [of God, i. e. the Kaabeh]; and
the intendants of the idols in the Time of Ignorance; the latter being the primary application:
(M, L:) but IB says that there is this difference

↓ سدّى as signifying also “ Oblivit telam viscosiore

in my copy of which I find only its inf. n.,

كردن جولاه): and Freytag adds, as a signification assigned to the same verb by Jac. Schultens,

مَعْزُوفًا, (Msb,) he did to him, or conferred upon

whom one says أَسْدَاكَ خَيْرًا [he did to thee good,

forth to the his arm, or hand, therewith, advancing: (Ham p. 696:) you say, اسدى نِعْمَةً,
meaning اِصْطَنْع [i. e. he did a benefit, &c.]. (Idem

(assumed tropical:)  [I sought a thing, and] I attained it, or obtained it: [as though meaning I stretched forth
my hand to it and reached it:] if you do not
attain it, or obtain it, you say, أَعْمَسْتُهُ: (S:) or
إِسْدَآءٌ signifies the attaining quickly. (KL.
[There expl. by the words زود دريافتن: for which
Golius seems to have found in his copy زود رفتن;
for he has assigned to اسدى, as on the authority
of the KL, the meaning of cito incessit.])

lower, or lowest, part thereof: (M: [but this is
a strange explanation, which I do not find elsewhere:]) it is [said to be] from السَّدْوُ [inf. n. of
سَدَا] signifying “ the stretching forth the arm, or
hand, or the fore leg, towards a thing: ” (Har
p. 241: [but it is mentioned in the M as belonging to art. سدى; and its dual, mentioned below,
requires its being so:]) and ↓ أَسْدِىٌّ, (M, K,)
also [and more commonly] written ↓ أُسْدِىٌّ, (K,)
signifies the same; (M, K;) as also ↓ سَدَاةٌ; (S,
K;) or this last is the n. un. of سَدًى, (M, TA,)
having a more special signification, (Msb, TA,)
[as though meaning a warp, or a sort of warp;
