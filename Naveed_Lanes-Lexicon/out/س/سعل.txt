سَعُلَ, (S, O, Msb, K,) inf. n. سُعَالٌ
(S, O, K) and سُعْلَةٌ, (K,) or the latter of these
is the inf. n., and the former is a simple subst.,
(Msb,) [He coughed:] سُعْلَةٌ signifies [the having]
a motion whereby nature expels somewhat hurtful from the lungs and the organs connected
therewith: (Ibn-Seenà, K, TA:) wherefore the
ducts of the lungs are called قَصَبُ السُّعَالِ [the
tubes of coughing, meaning the bronchial tubes,]
because it [i. e. what is hurtful in the lungs] has
its exit by them. (TA.) One says, إِنَّهُ يَسْعُلُ سُعْلَةً
مُنْكَرَةً [Verily he coughs with an abominable
coughing]. (TA.) And بِهِ سُعْلَةٌ [In him is a
coughing; i. e. he has a coughing, or cough].
(TA.) And أَغْصَّكَ السُّؤَالُ فَأَخَذَكَ السُّعَالُ [The
question, or petition, has choked thee, and consequently coughing has seized thee]. (TA.) ―
-b2-
Hence the saying, رَمَاهُ فَسَعَلَ الدَّمَ [He shot him,
and he consequently coughed up blood]; i. e.,
he threw [up] blood from his chest. (TA.)

brisk, lively, or sprightly; (K, TA;) like زَعِلَ,
inf. n. زَعَلٌ. (TA. [See the part. n., سَعِلٌ,

استسعلت (tropical:)  She (a woman) became a سِعْلَاة,
i. e., very clamorous, and foul-tongued; (S, O;)
or like a سِعْلَاة, (K, TA,) in badness, wickedness,

tenween is unusual,]) and ↓ سِعْلَى (S, O, TA)
The [kind of goblin, demon, devil, or jinnee,
called] غُول: (K:) or the female of the غُول:

Har p. 76:) or the worst, most wicked, or most
guileful, of the غِيلَان [pl. of غُول]: (S, O:) or
an enchantress of the jinn, or genii: (K:) pl. [of
the first] سَعَالٍ [written with the article السَّعَالِى]
(S, O, K) [and of the second سَعَالِىُّ] and of the
third سِعْلَيَاتٌ, which is said to signify the females
of the غِيلَان. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] سِعْلَاةٌ signifies
(tropical:)  A very clamorous, foul-tongued, woman: (S,
O, TA:) accord. to Aboo-'Adnán, a woman
foul in face, evil in disposition, is likened to the
سِعْلَاة: but some of the Arabs say that the Arabs
do not apply the epithet سِعْلَاةٌ to any but an old
woman. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And [the pl.] السَّعَالِى signifies

certain plant, the leaves of which make [the
ulcers termed] دُبَيْلَات to discharge their contents,
and dissolves them; and the fresh thereof remove
the mange, or scab: it is a most excellent remedy

حَشِيشَةُ السُّعَالِ; (TK;)] and causes the erection
of the ذَكَر to subside (وَيَفُشُّ الاِنْتِصَابَ, K, TA,
for which we find in some copies of the K
وَنَفْسِ الاِنْتِصَابِ); even the fumigating of oneself
therewith. (K.)

سَاعِلٌ [Coughing]. You say نَاقَةٌ سَاعِلٌ, (O,
K,) without ة, (O,) meaning A she-camel having
a cough. (O, K.) ―
-b2-  And إِنَّهُ لَذُو سُعَالٍ سَاعِلٍ
[Verily he has a violent cough]: (O, K: *) a phrase
having an intensive meaning: (K:) by rule one
should say سُعَال مُسْعِل; but thus the Arabs said,
like as they said شُغْلٌ شَاغِلٌ and شِعْرٌ شَاعِرٌ: and
[in like manner] a poet cited by Lth says ذُو سَاعِلٍ.
(O.) ―

He walked, went, or went along, (Er-Rághib,
Msb, K, TA,) quickly: (Er-Rághib, Mgh, TA:)
this, accord. to Er-Rághib, is the primary signification: and hence, السَّعْىُ بَيْنَ الصَّفَا وَالمَرْوَةِ [The
tripping to and fro between Es-Safà and ElMarweh]: (TA:) and سَعَى فِى مَشْيِهِ [app.

سَعَى المُكَاتِبُ فِى عِتْقِ رَقَبَتِهِ, (S,) or فِى فَكِ رَقَبَتِهِ,
i. e. [The slave who had made a contract with his
master to pay him a certain sum for his emancipation] laboured to earn the means of releasing
himself: (Msb:) the inf. n. of the verb thus used
is سعَايَةٌ: (S, Msb:) and this term is employed
when a slave emancipated in part, and in part
retained in slavery, labours and earns for the
completion of his release. (IAth, TA.) The
saying, in the Kur [liii. 40], لَيْسَ لِلْإِنْسَانِ إِلَّا مَا
سَعَى means [There is nothing imputable to the
man] but what he hath wrought, or done. (Msb.)

went to exact them, and received them; (TA;)
and the inf. n. in this case also is سِعَايَةٌ: (K,

inf. n. سَعْىٌ, (Msb,) he officiated in the exacting,
or receiving, or collecting, of the poor-rate. (S, *
Msb.) [And سَعَى is trans. without a prep. as

سَعَى عِقَالًا فَلَمْ يَتْرُكْ لَنَا سَبَدًا
فَكَيْفَ لَوْ قَدْ سَعَى عَمْرٌو عِقَالَيْنِ
[He exacted the poor-rate of a year, and left not
to us camels' fur, or goats' hair: then how would

two years?]. (S.) ―
-b6-  سَعَيْتُ فِى أَمْرِ فُلَانٍ is said
when one rectifies, redresses, or reforms, the
affair of such a one, or mars, vitiates, or perverts
it, by his سَعْى [or striving, or labouring; and
may be rendered I strove, or laboured, in respect
of the affair of such a one, either to rectify,
redress, or reform, it, or to mar, vitiate, or pervert, it]: and وَالَّذِينَ سَعَوْا فِى آيَاتِنَا, in the Kur
xxii. 50 [and xxxiv. 5], means And they who
strive, or labour, in respect of our signs, to mar,
or vitiate, or pervert, their meaning, by impugning their character; seeing that they called
them enchantment, and poetry, and tales, or
legends, or fictions: (Ksh in xxii. 50:) or these
words of the Kur mean and they who strive, or
labour, to falsify, or nullify, our signs; i. e. the
Kur-án. (Jel.) ―
-b7-  سَعَى بَيْنَهُمْ means He created,
or excited, disorder, or discord, between them, or
among them; made, or did, mischief between
them, or among them; as also سَأَا, which is app.,
in this case, a dial. var. of سَعَى. (TA in art.
سأو.) [Hence,] سَعَى بَيْنَ النَّاسِ بِالنَّمَائِمِ [He
created, or excited, disorder, &c., among the
people by calumnies, or slanders: or it may be
well rendered he busied himself among the people
with propagating calumnies, or slanders]. (S and
O in art. اكل; &c.) ―

1َاْ2َ3َ ↓ سَاعَانِى فُلَانٌ فَسَعَيْتُهُ, aor. of the latter أَسْعِيهِ,
means [Such a one strove with me in walking,
or going along, quickly, &c.,] and I overcame
him [therein]. (S, TA.) The inf. n. مُسَاعَاةٌ signifies The walking, or going, quickly [&c., or rather
the striving, or contending, in doing so,] with any
one. (KL.) Hence the trad. of 'Alee, in discommendation of worldly enjoyments, مَنْ سَاعَاهَا
فَاتَتْهُ, meaning مَنْ سَابَقَهَا [i. e. He who runs a
race with them, they evade him, or escape his
pursuit]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  مُسَاعَاةٌ also signifies One's
committing fornication with a female slave: and
a female slave's committing fornication with any
one: (KL:) you say, of a man, زَنَى and عَهَرَ, and
this is with a free woman and with a female
slave; but one says in the case of a female slave,
peculiarly, قَدْ سَاعَاهَا [He has committed fornication with her]; مُسَاعَاةٌ not being with any but
with female slaves: thus in a trad., إِمَآءٌ سَاعَيْنَ
فِى الجَاهِلِيَّةِ [Female slaves that committed fornication in the Time of Ignorance]: and أُتِىَ عُمَرَ
بِرَجُلٍ سَاعَى أَمَةً [There was brought to 'Omar a
man who committed fornication with a female
slave]: (S, TA: *) [and hence, وَلَدُ المُسَاعَاةِ (occurring in the L, in art. بهث, as mentioned by
IAar on the authority of Abu-l-Mekárim), meaning The offspring of fornication, begotten on a
slave:] or ساعاها, (K, TA,) inf. n. as above,
(TA,) signifies [or rather signifies also] He
sought her for the purpose of fornication: (K,
[in which the context seems to indicate that it
relates to a female slave,] and TA:) accord. to
Th, relating to the free woman and the female
slave: it is also said that مُسَاعَاةُ المَرْأَةِ signifies
The imposing upon the woman, by her owner, an
impost which she is to pay by means of [the gain
of] prostitution: and it is said in a trad. that
there shall be no مُسَاعَاة in El-Islám. (TA.)
-A2-
[It is said in the TA in art. ربع, that مُسَاعَاةٌ from
السَّاعَةُ is like مَُشَاهَرَةٌ from الشَّهْرُ and مُرَابَعَةٌ from
الرَّبِيعُ &c.; but I think that مساعاة in this instance
is a mistranscription for مُسَاوَعَةٌ: see art. سوع.]
4
اسعاهُ signifies جَعَلَهُ يَسْعَى, (K, TA,) i. e.
He made him to earn, or gain. (TA.) ―

their poor-rates. (TA.) [See also 10.] ―
-b3-  And
أَسْعَوْا بِهِ They gave him, or performed or accomplished for him, what he desired, or sought, or

10
استسعى العَبْدَ (S, Msb, K) فِى قِيمَتِهِ (S,
Msb) He required of the slave that he should
labour to earn the means of releasing himself:
(Msb:) or he imposed upon the slave work by
means of which he should pay for himself, when
he had been emancipated in part, in order to his
completing his emancipation: and ↓ سِعَايَةٌ signifies
the work so imposed. (K.) ―
-b2-  And استسعاهُ He
employed him as collector of the poor-rate.

S,] المَسْعَاةُ وَاحِدَةُ المَسَاعِى فِى الكَلَامِ وَالجُودِ:
and the author of the K, following Sgh, says
that he has committed a mistake in saying فِى
الكَلَامِ instead of فِى الكَرَمِ: in some copies of the
S is found فِى الكَرَمِ; but this is an emendation:
the original reading is فِى الكَلَامِ: which, however,
should be termed a slip of the pen [rather than a
mistake, for it cannot be that J was ignorant of
the meaning of so common a word as مَسْعَاةٌ].
(TA.)
مَسْعِىٌّ بِهِ Calumniated, or slandered, [and
especially] to a ruler, or magistrate. (TA.)
