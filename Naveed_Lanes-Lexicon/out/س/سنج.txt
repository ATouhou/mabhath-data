سَنَجَ He smeared anything with a colour
different from its own colour. (O, K.)
سُنُجٌ The عُنَّاب [or jujube]. (IAar, K.)
سَنْجَةٌ, as also صَنْجَةٌ, but the former is the
more chaste, (T, O, Msb, K,) accord to Fr, (O,)
because ص and ج do not both occur in any
[genuine] Arabic word, (Msb,) or the former
only is allowable accord. to Fr, (T, Msb,) or,
accord. to ISk, (T, O, Msb, and S in art. صنج,)
and IKt, (T, Msb,) the latter only is allowable;
(T, O, Msb, and S and O in art. صنج;) an arabicized word, (O, Msb, and S and A and K in art.
صنج,) from [the Pers.] سنك [or سَنْگْ, as meaning “ a weight ”]; (O;) [or rather from the
Pers. سَنْجَهْ meaning “ a balance ” and “ a
weight; ”] i. q. مِيزَانٌ [A balance]: (A in art.
صنج:) [in the present day, applied to a steel-yard: and also, more commonly, (agreeably with
the explanation of صَنْجَةٌ in the MA,) to a weight
of a balance; which last seems to be intended in
the S and O and Msb and K &c. by the expressions سَنْجَةُ المِيزَانِ and صَنْجَتُهُ, unless these
expressions be instances of what is termed إِضَافَةُ
الشَّىْءِ إِلَى نَفْسِهِ (i. e. the prefixing a noun, governing the gen. case, to another noun signifying the
same thing), which I think unlikely:] pl. سِنَجٌ
(A, Msb) and سَنَجَاتٌ. (Msb.) One says, اِتَّزَنَ
منّى بِالسَّنْجَة الرَّاجِحَةِ [He received by weight
from me with the inclining balance, or with the
preponderating weight], and بِالسِّنَجِ الوَافِيَةِ [with
the full weights]. (A.) And a rájiz says,
كَأَنَّهَا سَنْجَةُ أَلْفٍ رَاجِحَهْ
[As though it, or she, were the weight of a thousand, preponderating]: or, as some relate it,
صَنْجَةٌ. (O.)
سُنْجَةٌ i. q. رُقْطَةٌ [i. e. Blackness mixed with
speckles of white: or the reverse: or speckles of
white, and of black, and of red, and of yellow, in
an animal]: (AA, O, K:) pl. سُنَجٌ, (O, K, TA,
in the CK سُنْجٌ,) like حُجَرٌ (K, TA, in the CK
like حُجْرٌ,) as pl. of حُجْرَةٌ. (TA.)
سِنَاجٌ The mark, or effect, of the سِرَاج [i. e.
lamp, or its lighted wick], (A, O, K,) upon the
wall. (O, K, TA.) One says, لَابُدَّ لِلسِّرَاجِ مِنَ
السِّنَاجِ [The lamp, or its lighted wick, cannot but
have the mark, or effect, thereof upon the wall].
(A.) ―
-b2-  Also The سِرَاج [itself; i. e. a lamp, or
its lighted wick]: (ISd, K:) as also ↓ سَنِيجٌ. (K.)
سَنِيجٌ: see what next precedes.
بُرْدٌ مُسَنَّجٌ A [garment of the kind called] بُرْد
striped. (O, K.) [SM thinks that it may be a
mistranscription for مُسَبَّجٌ, meaning “ wide,” applied to a كِسَآء: but this I think improbable.]
