سلت1
سَلَتَ المِعَى, aor.
سَلِتَ, (M, K) and
سَلُتَ, (K,)
inf. n. سَلْتٌ, (M, TA,) He extracted, or made
to come forth, [the contents of] the gut [by
compressing it] with his hand. (M, K. [In both
it is expl. by أَخْرَجَهُ بِيَدِهِ: but it seems that a
fault has been accidentally committed by a copyist
in the former or in its original, and thence passed
into the latter; and that the words which I have
supplied are necessary to explain the true meaning. That such is the case, appears from what
here follows.]) It is said in the L that السَّلْتُ
signifies The griping, with the hand, a thing that
is contaminated by dirt, or filth, so that what is
in it comes forth; and thus is done with a gut.
(TA.) It is also said to signify The extracting,
or causing to come forth, what is fluid, or moist,
adhering to another thing. (MF, TA.) [Hence,]
سَلَتَ خَمْشَهُ i. e. مُخَاطَهُ عَنْ أَنْفِهِ [He cleansed
his nose of the mucus that was in it by compressing it with his fingers]: occurring in two
trads.; in one of which, the Prophet is related to
have been in the habit of doing this to El-Hoseyn
when he used to carry him upon his shoulder.
(TA.) [Hence, likewise,] it is said in a trad.,
فَيَنْفُذُ الجَحِيمُ إِلَى جَوْفِهِ فَيَسْلُتُ مَافِيهِ, i. e. [And
the fire of Hell shall penetrate to his inside, and]
shall exscind and extirpate what is in it. (TA.)
―
-b2-  You say also, سَلَتَ القَصْعَةَ, (S, A, K,) aor.
سَلُتَ,
inf. n. سَلْتٌ; (S;) and ↓ استلتها; (K;) He cleansed
the bowl by taking off with his finger what
remained upon its sides; (S;) he wiped the bowl
(A, K) with his fingers (A) or with his finger.
(K.) And سَلَتَتْ خِضَابَهَا عَنْ يَدِهَا, (S, Msb, K,)
aor.
سَلُتَ, inf. n. سَلْتٌ, (Msb,) She cast from her,
or from her hand, the remains of her stuff for
dyeing the hands or hair: (S, K:) or she put
away, or removed, that stuff from her hand:
(Msb:) or she wiped off, and cast away, that
stuff from her hand: (TA:) or سَلَتَ الخِضَابَ,
aor.
سَلُتَ, he took away, and wiped off, the material
for dyeing the hands or hair; and in like manner.
a similar thing; and sweat; and blood. (Mgh.)
سَلَتَ الدَّمَ عَنْهَا occurs in a trad. as meaning He
removed the blood [from her or it]. (TA.) ―
-b3-
سَلَتَ دَمَ البَدَنَةِ (M, K) means, accord. to Lh, He
scraped off the blood of the بدنة [or beast brought
to Mekkeh for sacrifice, or there sacrificed,]
with the knife: but [ISd says, (and in like
manner هَلَتَ دَمَ البَدَنَةِ is expl. in the L as on the
authority of Lh,)] in my opinion the meaning is,
he scraped off the skin of the بدنة with the knife
so that he made its blood to appear. (M. [The
explanation in the K is made up from the two
different explanations in the M, being as follows:
قَشَرَهُ حَتَّى أَظْهَرَ دَمَهَا, as though meaning he scraped
off the dried blood of the بدنة so that he made its
fresh blood to appear: but in the copy of the K
followed in the TA, النَّدَبَة (i. e. the scar) is put in
the place of البَدَنَة, and the former of these two
(i. e. الندبة) I regard as the right word.]) ―
-b4-  سَلَتَ
also signifies (assumed tropical:)  He cut off a thing. (K. [This is
said in the TA to be the primary meaning: but
accord. to the A, the phrase here following,
in which it has this meaning, is tropical.]) You
say, سَلَتَ أَنْفَهُ, (S, M, A, K,) aor.
سَلِتَ and
سَلُتَ,
inf. n. سَلْتٌ, (M,) (tropical:)  He cut off his nose (S, M,
A, K) entirely (TA) with a sword. (S, A.) And
سَلَتَ يَدَهُ بِالسَّيْفِ (assumed tropical:)  He cut off his hand, or arm,
with the sword. (M.) And سَلَتَ شَعَرَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He
shaved off his hair. (M, K.) And سَلَتَ رَأْسَهُ
(tropical:)  He shaved his head. (As, S, L.) ―
-b5-  سَلَتَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He
beat, struck, or smote, him: (K, TA:) and
flogged him. (TA.) You say, سَلَتُّهُ مِائَةَ سَوْطٍ
(assumed tropical:)  I inflicted upon him a hundred strokes of the
whip. (S, TA.) ―
-b6-  And سَلَتَ بِسَلْحِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He cast
forth his excrement, or ordure. (K.)

إِسْتَلَتَ see 1, in the former half of the paragraph.
سُلْتٌ A species of شَعِير [or barley], (Lth, S, M,
Mgh, Msb, K,) having no hush, (Lth, S, Mgh,
Msb,) أَجْرَدُ [which may mean either beardless
or smooth], (Lth,) [in appearance] as though it
were wheat, (S,) growing in El-Ghowr and El-
Hijáz; (Mgh, Msb;) the سَوِيق [or meal of the
parched grain] whereof is employed as a cooling
diet in the صَيْف [or summer]: (TA:) or i. q.
شَعِير [i. e. the common barley]; (M, K;) as some
say: (M:) or the sour (حَامِض) sort of شعير:
(M, K:) or a white شعير, without husk: or, as
some say, a species of wheat; but the explanation
next preceding this last is the more correct, for
البَيْضَآءُ and السُّلْتُ are mentioned in a trad. as
distinct, each from the other, and by the former
is meant wheat: (TA:) or a species of شعير with
a thin husk and small grain: (IF, Msb:) or a
grain between wheat and barley (شعير), not
having a husk like that of the latter, and thus
being like wheat in smoothness, and like barley
(شعير) in its nature, or quality, and in its coolness: (Az, Msb:) accord. to Es-Seydelánee, like
barley (شعير) in its form, and like wheat in its
nature, or quality; but this is a mistake: (Ibn-Es-Saláh, Msb:) [gymnocrithon (i. e. hordeum
nudym) of Galen: tragus of Diosc. (Golius.)]
ذَهَبَ مِنِّى فَلْتَةً وَسَلْتَةً It (a thing, or an affair,
TA) escaped me: (K, TA:) accord. to some,
سلتة is here an imitative sequent. (TA.)
سَلْتَآءُ A woman who does not make frequent
use of حِنَّآء [for tinging, or dyeing, her hands];
(S;) a woman who does not frequently tinge her
hands with خِضَاب: (M:) or a woman who does
not make use of خِضَاب for herself (M, A, K) at
all: so some say. (M.) It is related of the
Prophet, in a trad., that he cursed such a woman.
(TA.)
سُلَاتَةٌ What is extracted, or made to come
forth, (M, K, *) from a gut [by compressing it]

(S, K. *)
أَسْلَتُ A man (S) whose nose has been cut off
(S, M, K) entirely. (S, K.)
مِسْلَاتُ حِنَّآءُ [app. An instrument with which
حنّآء is scraped off, or removed, from the hand].
One says, أَعْطِنِى مِسْلَاتَ حِنَّائِكَ [Give thou to
me &c.]. (A.)
مَسْلُوتٌ That whereof the flesh that was upon
it has been taken off or away, or removed. (K.)
―
