superficial part: and it, namely, a thing, hitting
another thing, abraded from it a little of its
superficial part; as when a thing hits the solid
hoof previously to [that state of attenuation and

-b2-  See also 1. An ex. of the latter
inf. n. occurs in the following hemistich of the
“ Jeemeeyeh ” of El-'Ajjáj:
جَأْبَا تَرَى بِلِيِتِهِ مُسَحَّجَا
[A bulky, or strong, wild ass, in the side of whose
neck thou seest much biting, or lacerating of the
skin, that has made marks upon it]: thus heard
by AHát from the mouth of AZ, and thus recited
by the former to As, who disallowed it, and said,
تَلِيلَهُ [i. e. whose neck, or cheek, thou seest to be
much bitten, &c., instead of بِلِيِتِهِ], but abstained
from objecting after AHát had adduced other exs.
[of similar inf. ns.], and among them the saying
in the Kur [xxxiv. 18], وَ مَزَّقْنَاهُمْ كُلَّ مُمَزَّقٍ: Az
says that مسحّجا is here made an inf. n., like
تَسْحِيجًا. (TA)

7
انسحج It had its outer integument, or
superficial part, abraded, or otherwise removed:
(S, K:) said of the skin: (S:) [and it seems from
the phrase سَحَجُ الفَخِذَيْنِ occurring in the O
and K in art. بذح, that ↓ سَحِجَ, inf. n. سَحَجٌ,
may signify the same: but سَحَجُ may there be a
mistranscription for سَحْجُ.] One says, اِنْسَحَجَ
جِلْدُهُ مِنْ شَىْءٍ مَرَّ بِهِ His skin had its cuticle
abraded in consequence of a thing that passed by
him. (TA.)
سَحْجٌ inf. n. of سَحَجَ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And [hence,

in the belly. (TA.) You say, بِهِ سَحْجٌ (S) i. e.
In him is the disease above mentioned. (PS.)
سَحُوجٌ: see سَحَّاجٌ.
سَحِيجٌ Having its outer integument, or superficial part, abraded, or otherwise removed; as
also ↓ مَسْحُوجٌ. (TA.)

is not slow in becoming attenuated and abraded
in the sole. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also (assumed tropical:)  A man who makes
oaths to follow one another with little, or no,

applied to a woman. (K, * TA.) And حَلِفٌ سَحَّاجٌ
(assumed tropical:)  A swearing in which the oaths are made so to
follow one another. (TA.)

سَاحِجٌ act. part. n. of سَحَجَ: fem. with ة: pl.

earth, removing the dust and pebbles]. (A, TA.)
[
مَسْحَجٌ A place of abrasion, &c.: pl. مَسَاحِجُ.

-b2-  Hence,] one says, of an ass, (A,) i. e. a wild

marks, or scars, of the biting of other asses. (A,
TA.)

which one pares, or shapes, wood. (O, K.) ―

pared the surface of the earth. Accord. to Freytag, مَسْحَجٌ occurs in this sense in the Deewán

evidently مِسْحَجٌ.] ―
-b3-  Also, and ↓ مِسْحَاجٌ, (O,
K, TA,) A wild ass that bites [other asses] much,
