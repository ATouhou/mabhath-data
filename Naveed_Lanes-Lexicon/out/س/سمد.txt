سمد1
سَمَدَ, (S, M, &c.,) aor.
سَمُدَ, (M, L,) inf. n.
سُمُودٌ, He (a man, IAar) was, or became, high, or
elevated. (IAar, S, M, L, K. [عَلاءً in the CK is
a mistake for عَلا.]) ―
-b2-  He raised his head; (L;
[and the same is implied in the S; see سَامِدٌ;])
and so سَمِدَ: (M, L:) [and] he raised his head in
pride. (S, L, K.) And in the former sense it is
said of a camel, in his going along. (Bd in liii. 61.)
―
-b3-  Also He (a man) stood, raising his head, and
with his breast erect; like as the stallion [camel]
does when excited by lust: (A:) [for] it is said of
a stallion [camel] when thus excited. (L.) ―
-b4-  And
hence, (A,) (tropical:)  He sang: (M, A, L:) because the
singer raises his head and erects his breast: (A:)
but Th says that this is rare: (M:) accord. to
I'Ab, سُمُودٌ signifies the act of singing in the dial.
of Himyer. (L.) ―
-b5-  Also, (M, K,) aor. as above,
(TA,) and so the inf. n., (S, M,) (assumed tropical:)  He diverted
himself, sported, or played. (S, M, K, TA. [For
لَهِىَ in the CK, I read لَهَا, as in the M, and in
MS. copies of the K, and in the TA; and agreeably with the S, in which the inf. n. is expl. as
syn. with لَهْوٌ.]) ―
-b6-  He was, or became, negligent,
inattentive, inadvertent, inconsiderate, or heedless; and went away from, or relinquished, or
left, a thing. (L.) ―
-b7-  He was, or became, confounded, perplexed, or amazed, and unable to
see his right course; or affected with wonder;
or cut short, or silent, being confounded, or perplexed, and unable to see his right course; syn.
بُهِتَ: inf. n. as above: (M:) [or] he stood confounded, or perplexed, and unable to see his right
course; syn. قَامَ مُتَحَيِّرًا. (K. [After this explanation and لَهَا immediately following it, it is said
in the K, والسُّمُودُ يَكُونُ حُزْنًا وَسُرورًا: meaning
that it is by reason of grieving, or mourning, as
signifying the “ standing confounded ” &c.; and
by reason of rejoicing, or being happy, as signifying the “ diverting oneself ” &c. See as an ex. of
its usage in a case of grief the verses which I
have cited at the close of the first paragraph of
art. رد, and which are cited in the present art. in
the L and TA.]) ―
-b8-  Also He kept constantly, or
continually, (M, L,) to an affair, (M,) or upon
the ground, or in the land. (L.) ―
-b9-  He strove
laboured, or exerted himself, or he wearied himself, in work, (K, TA,) and in journeying. (TA.)
And سَمَدَتِ الإِبِلُ (S, M, K) فِى سَيْرِهَا, (S,) aor.
and inf. n. as above, (M,) The camels strove,
laboured, or exerted themselves, in their journeying: (S, K:) or knew not fatigue, or weariness.
(M.) [See also سَمْدٌ, (which is likewise, perhaps,
an inf. n. of the same verb,) below.]
-A2-  سَمَدَهُ,
inf. n. سَمْدٌ, i. q. قَصَدَهُ [He tended, repaired,
betook himself, or directed himself or his course or
aim, to, or towards, him, or it; or endeavoured
to reach, or attain, or obtain, him, or it; &c.];
like صَمَدَهُ. (M.)
-A3-  And سَمَدَ الأَرْضَ, inf. n. سَمْدٌ,
He made the land, or ground, plain, or smooth,
or soft. (M.)
2
سمّدهُ, (M, TA,) inf. n. تَسْمِيدٌ, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  He
diverted him: (M, TA:) [and in like manner,
↓ اسمدهُ; for] one says to a slave-songstress,
أَسْمِدِينَا, [in one of my copies of the S, erroneously,
اسْمُدِينَا,] meaning Divert thou us by singing.
(S, O, L, TA.)
-A2-  سمّد الأَرْضَ, (M, Msb, K,)
inf. n. as above, (S, Msb, K,) He manured the
land with سَمَاد [q. v.]: (S, Msb, K:) he dunged,
or manured, the land; syn. زَبَّلَهَا. (M. [So in a
copy of the M: in the TA زبلها, without teshdeed;
and thus only, I believe, correctly; though it is
commonly pronounced with teshdeed in the present day.])
-A3-  سمد شَعَرَهُ, (M,) or الشَّعَرَ, (K,)
inf. n. as above, (TA,) He removed utterly his
hair, or the hair; (M, K, TA;) taking the whole
of it [in shaving]: a dial. var. of سبّد. (TA.)
تَسْمِيدُ الرَّأْسِ is The removing utterly the hair of
the head [by shaving]: a dial. var. of تَسْبِيد. (S.)
―
-b2-  And تَسْمِيدٌ is also used [alone, the objective
complement being app. meant to be understood,]
as meaning The leaving off, or neglecting, the
anointing of oneself [or of one's hair], and washing: and so تَسْبِيدٌ. (A 'Obeyd, TA in art. سبد.)

Q. Q. 4
اِسْمَأَدَّ, (S, M, L,) inf. n. اِسْمِئْدَادٌ, (S,)
He, or it, became swollen: (M, L:) or became
much swollen: (AZ, M, L:) or he (a man) became swollen with anger; (S, L;) or so ↓ اِسْمَادَّ,
inf. n. اِسمِيدَادٌ; and ↓ اِسْمَدَّ, inf. n. اِسْمِدَادٌ. (K.)
One says, اسمأدّت يَدَهُ His arm, or hand, became
swollen: and اسمأدّت رِجْلُهَا Her leg, or foot,
became inflated and swollen. (L, TA.) ―
-b2-  Also,
said of anything, It went, or passed, away: or
perished; and so ↓ اسمدّ. (L, TA.) And اسمأدّ
مِنَ الغَضَبِ He perished by reason of anger. (L.)
سَمْدٌ Continuing, or unceasing, journeying.
(M, L.) [Perhaps an inf. n.: see سَمَدَتِ الإِبِلُ,
and what next precedes it, in the latter part of
the first paragraph.] ―
-b2-  هُوَ لَكَ سَمْدًا, (K, TA,) or
↓ سَمَدًا, (M,) [in my copy of the Mgh سمدًا, and
in the O سَمدًا,] He, or it, is thine ever, or for
ever; syn. سَرْمَدًا, (Th, M, Mgh, O, K,) and أَبَدًا.
(Th, M, Mgh.) And لَا أَفْعَلُ ذٰلِكَ سَمْدًا or ↓ سَمَدًا,
(M,) I will not do that ever. (M, TA.)
سَمَدًا: see the next preceding paragraph, in
two places.
سَمَادٌ A compost, or manure, consisting of
سِرْجِين, (S, Mgh, Msb,) or سِرْقِين, (K,) [both
meaning dung of beasts, such as horses, camels,
sheep and goats, wild oxen, and the like,] with
ashes, (S, K,) or with earth or dust: (Mgh,
Msb:) or a manure consisting of strong earth.
(M.)
سَمِيدٌ i. q. حُوَّارَى (A, K) [app. as meaning
White, or whitened, flour: but said in the TK to
mean fine bread]: accord. to Kr, i. q. طَعَامٌ [app.
as meaning wheat]; and said by him to be with
the unpointed د: (K:) but more chastely, (K,)
and better known, (TA,) with ذ. (K, TA.) [In
the present day, applied to Semoulia; a kind of
paste made of very fine wheat-flour, reduced to
small grains. See also إِسْمِيدٌ, below.]
سَامِدٌ Any [man or animal] raising his head
[in pride or otherwise]. (S, M, L.) ―
-b2-  A man
standing: (IAar; and so in a copy of the S:) or
standing, raising his head, and with his breast
erect; (A, IAth;) as the stallion [camel] does
when excited by lust. (A.) ―
-b3-  [And hence, as is
indicated in the A, (see 1,)] (assumed tropical:)  A singer; or singing. (M, L; and so in two copies of the S.) And
the latter is said to be the meaning of the pl. in
the Kur liii. 61. (M, L.) ―
-b4-  [Hence also,] Behaving proudly. (I 'Ab in explanation of the pl.
in the Kur liii. 61; and IAar.) ―
-b5-  Diverting
himself; playing; or sporting. (IAar, S, M;
and Bd in liii. 61,) ―
-b6-  Negligent, inattentive,
inadvertent, inconsiderate, or heedless. (Lth,
IAar A.) Thus the pl. is said by Lth to mean
in the Kur liii. 61. (TA.) ―
-b7-  Standing in a state
of confusion, perplexity, or amazement: (Mgh:)
and so the pl. is said to mean in the Kur liii. 61:
(TA:) or confounded, perplexed, or amazed, by
reason of inordinate exultation. (IAar.) ―
-b8-  And
Silent. (So in a copy of the S.) ―
-b9-  And Grieving,
or mourning, and lowly, humble, or submissive.
(So, too, in a copy of the S.) ―
-b10-  In the saying of
Ru-beh, (K,) describing camels, (TA,)
سَوَامِدُ اللَّيْلِ خِفَافُ الأَزْوَادْ
the meaning is, Continuing journeying, (K,) or
striving, labouring, or exerting themselves, or
wearying themselves, [during the night,] having
no fodder in their bellies: (L:) F says that J has
erred in saying that the meaning is, “having no
fodder in their bellies: ” but this is the explanation
of the words خفاف الازواد, as IM and others have
expressly stated; and this necessarily indicates
that سوامد has the meaning assigned to it in the
K; so that no error is attributable to J in this
case: or, as some say, خفاف الازواد means not
having upon their backs [much] provision for the
riders. (TA.) ―
-b11-  سَامِدٌ as an epithet applied to a
وَطْب [or skin in which milk is put] means (tropical:)  Full,
[so as to be] standing upright. (A, TA.)
إِسْمِيدٌ What is called in Persian سِمِدٌ [app. a
mistranscription for شَمَذْ, i. e. white bread]; an
arabicized word: [so says ISd; and he adds,] I
know not whether it be the same as سَمِيدٌ expl.
by Kr as signifying طَعَامٌ, or not. (M.)
مِسْمَدٌ i. q. زَبِيلٌ [i. e. A basket of palm-leaves;
probably one used for carrying سَمَاد, or manure]:
so says Lh; adding that one should not say
مِسْمَدَةٌ. (M.)
