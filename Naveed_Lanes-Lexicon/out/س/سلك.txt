سلك1
سَلَكَ الطَّرِيقَ, (IAar, MA, Msb,) or المَكَانَ,
(K,) aor.
سَلُكَ, (Msb, TA,) inf. n. سُلُوكٌ (MA, Msb,
K) and سَلْكٌ, (K, [but I doubt this latter's being
correctly used as an inf. n. of the verb in the
sense here immediately following,]) He travelled,
(MA,) or went along in, (Msb,) the road, (IAar,
MA, Msb,) or the place: (K:) or سَلَكَ المَكَانَ
he entered into the place. (TK.) [In these and
similar instances, it seems that the prep. فِى is
suppressed, and the noun therefore put in the
accus. case, as in دَخَلَ البَيْتَ &c.: for it is said
that] سَلَكَ as meaning He entered (دَخَلَ) is
intrans.: (Kull p. 206:) ↓ انسلك [likewise] has
this meaning: (S:) ↓ اسلك as an intrans. verb [in
the sense of سَلَكَ] is extr. (Msb.) [سَلَكَ طَرِيقًا
is also often used tropically, as meaning (tropical:)  He
pursued a course of conduct or the like.]
-A2-  And
سَلَكَهُ الطَّرِيقَ, (IAar, Msb,) or المَكَانَ, and فِيهِ,
(K,) [inf. n. سَلْكٌ;] and إِيَّاهُ ↓ اسلكهُ, (Msb, K,)
this also is allowable, (IAar, TA,) and فِيهِ, and
عَلَيْهِ; (K;) He made him [to travel or] to go
along in [or to enter] the road, (IAar, * Msb,) or
the place: (K:) and so سَلَكَ بِهِ الطَّرِيقَ: (Msb:)
and ↓ سلّكهُ, inf. n. تَسْلِيكٌ, signifies the same as
[سَلَكَهُ thus used, and] اسلكهُ. (TA.) And سلَكَتُ
الشَّىْءَ فِى الشَّىْءِ, (S, Msb,) inf. n. سَلْكٌ, (S,) I
made the thing to enter, or I inserted it, or introduced it, into the thing: (S:) or I made the thing to
go, or pass, through the thing: (Msb:) and ↓ أَسْلَكْتُهُ
signifies the same. (S. [See an ex. of the latter
verb in a verse of 'Abd-Menáf Ibn-Riba El-Hudhalee, voce إِذَا; cited there and here also in the S.])
You say, سَلَكَ الخَيْطَ فِى الإِبْرَةِ He inserted the
thread into the needle. (MA.) And سَلَكَ يَدَهُ
فِى الجَيْبِ He inserted [his hand, or arm, into
the opening at the neck and bosom of the shirt];
as also ↓ أَسْلَكَهَا: (K:) and so into the skin for
milk or water, and the like. (TA.) And it is
said in the Kur [xxvi. 200], كَذٰلِكَ سَلَكْنَاهُ فِى
قُلُوبِ المُجْرِمِينَ Thus we have caused it to enter
[into the hearts of the sinners]. (S.) And in the
same [xxxix. 22], فَسَلَكَهُ يَنَابِيعَ فِى الأَرْضِ [And
hath caused it to enter into springs in the earth].
(TA.)
