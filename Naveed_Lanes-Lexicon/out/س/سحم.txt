سَحَمٌ: see سُحْمَةٌ.
-A2-  A sort of tree; (S, K;)
like ↓ سَحْمَآءُ: (S:) the latter also signifies a sort
of tree: (K:) the former is said by ISk to be a
certain plant: and by AHn, to be a plant that
grows like the نَصِىّ and صِلِّيَان and عَنْكَث, except
that it is taller; the سَحَمَة [i. e. the single plant
of this species] being sometimes as tall as a man,
and larger. (TA.)

n. un. with ة; meaning a lump, or piece, of iron.

سُحْمَةٌ Blackness; (S, Msb, K;) as also ↓ سَحَمٌ,

the epithet ↓ أَسْحَمُ is applied. (Lth, TA.)

أَسْحَمُ Black; (S, Msb, K;) like أَسْخَمُ; (TA
in art. سخم;) applied to the crow; see سُحْمَةٌ:
(Lth, TA:) fem. سَحْمَآءُ; (Msb, TA;) applied to
a plant of that colour; (ISk, TA;) and particularly to the نَصِىّ when it is of that colour, and
thus applied as an intensive epithet; and to a
woman in the same sense: (TA:) and ↓ إِسْحِمَانٌ
signifies anything black (ISd, K) accord. to some;
but this is a mistake, for it is only أَسْحَمُ. (ISd,
TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] الأَسْحَمُ is the name of A certain idol, (K, TA,) which was black. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And
The night. (TA.) ―
-b4-  [Hence likewise,] أَسْحَمُ

some say, black clouds: and سَحْمَآءُ signifies a
black cloud. (TA.) ―
-b5-  Also Blood into which
are dipped the hands of persons swearing, one to
another; (K;) or blood into which the hand is
dipped on the occasion of swearing with another
or others: said to have this meaning in the saying
of El-Aashà,
رَضِيعَىْ لِبَانِ ثَدْىِ أُمٍّ تَحَالَفَا
بِأَسْحَمَ دَاجٍ عَوْضُ لَا تَتَفَرَّقُ
[Two foster-brothers by the sucking of the breast
of one mother swore together, by dark blood into
which they dipped their hands, that you, or they,
i. e. a tribe (قَبِيلَة) or a company of men (جَمَاعَة),
for, without the context, the meaning is doubtful,
should not ever become separated]: or it has here
one, or another, of three meanings here following. (S.) ―
-b6-  The womb. (S.) ―
-b7-  The nipple of a
woman's breast: (K:) or the blackness of the
nipple of a woman's breast. (S.) ―
-b8-  A skin such
as is termed زِقّ for wine: (S, K:) because of
its blackness: and ↓ سُحَيْمٌ also signifies a زِقّ
(TA.) ―
-b9-  Also A horn: (S, K:) thus in the saying of Zuheyr,
وَتَذَبِيبُهَا عَنْهُ بِأَسْحَمَ مِذْوَدِ
[And the frequent repelling of her, or them, from
him with a horn; so that مذود is merely an explicative adjunct, for it also means a horn, or it
may be rendered here an instrument for repel-ling]: (S, * TA:) or [اسحم is here an epithet,
and] the meaning is, with a black horn. (TA.)
Another poet uses the phrase تَذُبُّ بِسَحْمَاوَيْنِ.
[so in the TA, app. a mistranscription for تَذُبُّ,]
i. e., [reading تَذُبُّ, She repels] with a pair of
horns; using the fem, as meaning بِصِيصيَتَيْنِ;
as though he said بِصِيصِيتَيْنِ سَحْمَاوَيْنِ [with two
black horns]. (IAar, TA.) ―
-b10-  The fem., السَّحْمَآءُ
also signifies The دُبُر [here meaning anus]: (K:)
because of its colour. (TA.) ―
-b11-  For another signification of the fem., see سَحَمٌ.
أُسْحُمَانٌ Of the colour termed أُدْمَةٌ [here app.
meaning tawniness] in an intense degree. (TA.)
―
-b2-  Also A sort of tree. (M, K.) A poet uses
the phrase الأُسْحُمَانُ الأَسْحَمُ [The black, or dark,
اسحمان]. (M, TA.)
إِسْحِمَانٌ: see أَسْحَمُ, first sentence.
