سَتَّهُ, [aor.
سَتُ3َ, accord to rule, and inf. n. app.
سَتٌّ, q. v.,] He attributed or imputed to him, or
charged him with, or accused him of, a fault, or
defect, or the like; as also سَدَّهُ; syn. عَابَهُ. (TA.
[The sense in which عابه is there used is indicated
by the context.])
سَتٌ a dial. var. of اِسْتٌ: see the latter word in
art. سته, in two places.
سَتٌّ Foul, or evil, speech or language. (IAar,
K.) ―
-b2-  And also, [like سَدٌّ,] A fault, or defect, or
the like; syn. عَيْبٌ. (K.)
سِتٌّ: see سِتَّةٌ, of which it is the fem. ―
-b2-  سِتِّى
said to a woman means, (K, TA,) accord. to the
explanation of IAmb, (TA,) يَا سِتَّ جِهَاتِى [O
thou who occupiest the six places in relation to
me; or, who art above me, below me, before me,
behind me, on my right, and on my left]: (K,
TA:) as though alluding to her holding the
speaker in her possession: (TA:) or it is an incorrect expression; (K;) or it is vulgar, and
held in low estimation; (IAar, TA;) and is correctly سَيِّدَتِى [my lady, or my mistress]: (K:)
it may be regarded as a contraction of سَيِّدَتِى,
accord. to Esh-Shiháb El-Kásimee: (TA:) and
Es-seyyid 'Eesà Es-Safawee says that it should
not be restricted to the class of expression used
as vocatives. (MF, TA.)
سِتَّةٌ (Lth, T, S, M) and ↓ سِتَّ, (Lth, T, S, M,
K,) the former masc. and the latter fem., (S,)
[signifying Six,] are originally سِدْسَةٌ (Lth, T,
M) and سِدْسٌ; (Lth, T, S, M, K;) the latter س
is changed into ت, and the د is incorporated into
it; (Lth, T, S, M, K;) for the dim, of سِتَّةٌ is
سُدَيْسَةٌ [and that of سِتٌّ is سُدَيْسٌ], and the pl. is
أَسْدَاسٌ. (Lth, T, S.) You say, عِنْدِى سِتَّةُ رِجَالٍ
وَ نِسْوَةٍ [I have with me, or at my abode, six men
and women], i. e., three men and three women:
and you may say, عِنْدِى سِتَّةُ رِجَالٍ وَ نِسْوَةٌ, meaning, six men, and also women: and in like
manner you do in the ease of any number that
can be divided so as to apply to two plurals, as
six and seven and the higher numbers: but in the
case of a number that cannot be divided so as to
apply to two plurals, as five and four and three,
you put the latter noun in the nom. case only,
saying, for ex., عِنْدِى خَمْسَةُ رِجَالٍ وَ نِسْوَةٌ. (ISk,
S.) [Respecting a peculiar pronunciation of the
people of El-Hijáz, and a case in which سِتَّة is
imperfectly decl., see ثَلَاثَةٌ and تِسْعَةً.] ―
-b2-  سِتَّةَ عَشَرَ
[indecl. in every case, meaning Sixteen,] is pronounced by some of the Arabs سِتَّةَ عْشَرَ: and [the
fem.] سِتَّ عَشْرَةَ, thus in the dial. of El-Hijáz
[and of most of the Arabs], is pronounced سِتَّ
عَشِرَةَ in the dial of Nejd. (S in art. عشر.) ―
-b3-
سِتُّمِائَةٍ [meaning Six hundred] should be written
thus, without separating the two words; because
سِتٌّ is originally سِدْسٌ and the union of the two
words is to compensate for the incorporation of
the د into the ت. (El-Hareeree, in De Sacy's
Anthol. Gramm. Ar., p. 72 of the Arabic text.)
سِتُّونَ [Sixty,] one of the tenfold numbers, (M,
TA,) namely, that between خَمْسُونَ and سَبْعُونَ,
(TA,) is derived from سِتٌّ. (M, TA.) ―
-b2-  [Also
Sixtieth.]
سَاتٌّ [Sixth]. You say, جَآءَ فُلَانٌ سَادِسًا and
سَادِيًا and سَاتًّا [Such a one came sixth]; سادسا
being formed from سِدْسٌ; and ساتّا, from سِتَّةٌ and
سِتٌّ: in ساديا, the [latter] س [of سادسا] is changed
into ى; for certain letters in other cases are
sometimes so changed; as in أَمَّا and أَيْمَا and
تَسَنَّنَ and تَسَنَّى, and تَقَضَّضَ and تَقَضَّى, and
تَلَعَّعَ and تَلَعَّى, and تَسَرَّرَ and تَسَرَّى. (ISk, S.)
اِسْتٌ: see arts. است and سته: it is properly
mentioned in the latter art., being originally سَتَهٌ.
(S, TA.)
