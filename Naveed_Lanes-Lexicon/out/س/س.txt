سalphabetical letter
س
The twelfth letter of the alphabet; called
سِينٌ. It is one of the letters termed مَهْمُوسَة [or
non-vocal, i. e. pronounced with the breath only,
without the voice]; and of the letters termed
أَسَلِيَّة, as also ص and ز, because proceeding from
the tip of the tongue: its place of utterance is
between that of ص and that of ز: and Az says
hat it is never conjoined with either of these two
letters in any Arabic word: (TA:) it is a sibilant
letter; and is distinguished from ص by the
raising of the tongue to the palate [in the utterance of the latter], and from ز by the suppression
of the voice [in the utterance of the former].
(K in art. سين.) It is one of the letters of augmentation [occurring in the form اِسْتَفْعَلَ and its
derivatives]. (S and L in art. سين.) [See also
سِينٌ in art. سين. It is sometimes substituted for
ص; as in سَقْرٌ, for صَقْرٌ: and for ش, as in سِطْرَنْجٌ,
for شِطْرَنْجٌ: (see De Sacy's Chrest. Arabe, sec.
ed., ii. 230-233: and iii. 530-532:)] and AZ
says that some of the Arabs substitute for it ت,
(S and L and K * in art. سين,) as in the saying
(S and L in art. سين) of 'Alyà Ibn-Arkam,
(L ib.,)
يَا قَبَحَ اللّٰهُ بَنِى السِّعْلَاتِ
عَمْرَو بْنَ يَرْبُوعٍ شِرَارَ النَّاتِ
لَيْسُوا أَعفَّآءَ وَلَا أَكْيَاتِ
[O, may God remove far from good, or from
prosperity, the sons of the Sialáh, 'Amr Ibn-Yarbooa, the worst of mankind: they are not
chaste, nor sharp in intellect]: he means النَّاسِ
and بِأَكْيَاسِ: (S and L ib.:) and in like manner
one says طَسْتٌ for طَسٌّ. (TA in art. كيت.) ―
-b2-
يٰس in the Kur [commencing ch. xxxvi.] is like
آلم and حٰم at the commencement of chapters of
the same; and is said by 'Ikrimeh to mean
يَا إِنْسَانُ [O man]; because it is followed by the
words إِنَّكَ لَمِنَ المُرْسَلِينَ: (S and L in art. سين:)
or it means either thus, or يَا سَيِّدُ [O man of
dignity]. (K in art. سين.)
-A2-  سَ is a particle
peculiarly prefixed to the aor., rendering it clearly
denotative of the future, (Mughnee, and S * and
L * in art. سين,) as in سَيَفْعَلُ [He will do such a
thing], (S and L ib.,) and considered as forming
a part thereof, for which reason it does not exercise any government upon it: it is not contracted from سَوْفَ, contrary to what the Koofees
hold: nor is the extent of the future with it
shorter than it is with سَوْفَ, contrary to what the
Basrees hold: the analytical grammarians term
it حَرْفُ تَنْفِيسٍ, by which is meant a particle of
amplification; because it changes the aor. from
the strait time, which is the present, to the ample
time, which is the future: but plainer that their
expression is the saying of Z and others, [that it
is] a particle denoting the future. (Mughnee.)
Kh asserts that it corresponds [as an affirmative]
to [the negative] لَنْ. (S and L in art. سين.)
Some assert that it sometimes denotes continuance,
not futurity: this is mentioned in relation to the
saying in the Kur [iv. 93], سَتَجِدُونَ آخَرِينَ [as
though meaning Ye continually find others];
and they adduce as an evidence thereof the saying
in the same [ii. 136], سَيَقُولُ السَّفَهَآءُ مِنَ النَّاسِ مَا
وَلَّاهُمْ عَنْ قِبْلَتِهِمْ [as meaning The light-witted of
the people continually say, What hath turned
them away, or back, from their kibleh?]; affirming
that this was revealed after their saying مَا وَلَّاهُمْ:
but this the grammarians know not; and that
this verse was revealed after their saying ما ولّاهم
is not a fact agreed upon: moreover, if it be conceded, still continuance is inferred from the aor.;
like as when you say, فُلَانٌ يَقْرِى الضَّيْفَ and
يَصْنَعُ الجَمِيلَ, you mean that it is his custom to
do thus. (Mughnee.) Z asserts that when it is
prefixed to a verb signifying what is liked or
disliked, it denotes that the event will inevitably
happen: i. e., when it is prefixed to a verb signifying a promise or a threat, it corroborates and
confirms its meaning. (Mughnee.)
-A3-  [As a numeral, س denotes Sixty.]
