سجع1
سَجَعَ, aor.
سَجَعَ, inf. n. سَجْعٌ, He pursued an
even, uniform course; he pursued an even course,
following one order: this is the primary signification. (TA.) [It seems to be properly intrans.;
but is sometimes used as a trans. verb, لِ or إِلَى
being perhaps understood; as in the following
phrase;] سَجَعَ ذٰلِكَ المَسْجَعَ He pursued, or
aimed at, that object of pursuit or aim; (K,
TA;) occurring in a trad. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And It
was even and uniform, one part thereof being
like another. (TA.) ―
-b3-  [Hence,] سَجَعَتِ الحَمَامَةُ,
(IDrd, S, Msb, K,) aor.
سَجَعَ, (Msb, K,) inf. n.
سَجْعٌ, (Mbr, TA,) and quasi-inf. n. ↓ سِجْعٌ,
(TA,) The pigeon continued its cry uninterruptedly in one uniform way or manner; or
called, and prolonged its voice or cry, modulating
it sweetly: (Mbr, in the “ Kámil; ” and TA:)
or cooed: or reiterated its voice or cry: syn.
هَدَرَتْ: (S, Msb:) and صَوَّتَتْ: (Msb:) or رَدَّدَتْ
صَوْتَهَا. (IDrd, K.) It is said in a prov., لَا
آتَيكَ مَا سَجَعَ الحَمَامُ [I will not come to thee as
long as the pigeon cooes;] meaning I will never
come to thee. (Lh.) ―
-b4-  You say also, سَجَعَتِ
النَّاقَةُ, (S, TA,) inf. n. سَجْعٌ, (TA,) The she-camel prolonged her yearning cry in one uniform
manner. (S, TA.) ―
-b5-  And سَجَعَتِ القَوْسُ (tropical:)  The
bow prolonged its twang in one uniform manner,
monotonously. (TA.) ―
-b6-  And hence by way of
comparison to the سَجْع of the pigeon, سَجَعَ كَلَامَهُ
(tropical:)  He (a man) made his speech, or language, [to
be rhyming prose, i. e.,] to have فَوَاصِل like the
rhymes of verse, without its being measured.
(Msb.) And سَجَعَ [alone], (S, K,) aor.
سَجَعَ, (K,)
inf. n. سَجْعٌ; (S, TA;) and ↓ سجّع, inf. n. تَسْجِيعٌ;
(S, TA;) (tropical:)  He (a man, S) spoke, or uttered, [or
composed,] (S, * K, TA,) rhyming speech or language, (S,) [i. e., rhyming prose, i. e.,] speech, or
language, having فَوَاصِل (K, TA) like the فَوَاصِل
of verse, without measure: as is said in a description of Sijistán, وَتَمْرُهَا وَ لِصُّهَا بَطَلْ  مَاؤُهَا وَشَلْ
وَ إِنْ قَلُّوا ضَاعُوا  إِنْ كَثُرَ الجَيْشُ بِهَا جَاعُوا   دَقَلْ
[Its water is such as scantily distils, in interrupted
drops, from mountains or rocks, and its robber is
a man of courage, and its dates are of the worst
kind: if the army be numerous in it, they hunger; and if they be few, they perish]: so says
Lth. (TA.) You say also, سَجَعَ بِالشَّىْءِ, meaning
(tropical:)  He uttered the thing in the manner above
described. (TA.) [See also سَجْعٌ, below.]

سَجَّعَ see the preceding paragraph.
سَجْعٌ; [originally inf. n. of سَجَعَ, q. v.;] (S,
Msb, K, &c.;) or, as some say, ↓ سِجْعٌ, but the
former is that which commonly obtains, the
latter being said to be a subst. like ذِبْحٌ meaning
“ what is slaughtered,” unknown, however, in
the lexicons, and probably one of the instances of
the elicitations of the foreigners, (MF, TA,) the
object of him who says that it is سِجْعٌ being app.
to make a distinction between the simple subst.
and the inf. n., as in the case of the simple subst.
and the inf. n. of سَجَعَ said of the pigeon; [see
سَجَعَتِ الحَمَامَةُ;] (TA;) and ↓ أُسْجُوعَةٌ; (S, *
K;) (tropical:)  Rhyming speech or language; (S, K, TA;)
[i. e. rhyming prose; i. e.] speech, or language,
having فَوَاصِل like the rhymes of verse, without
being measured; so called as being likened to the
سَجْع of the pigeon; (Msb;) or because of its
uniformity, (TA,) and the mutual resemblance
and agreement of the words which end its clauses:
(IJ, TA:) or a consecution [of clauses] of speech
or language, with one رَوِىّ [which is the principal, or only, rhyme-letter]: (Jm, K:*) or it
consists in the agreement of the endings of words
[or clauses], in a certain order, like the agreement of the rhymes (قَوَافٍ) [of verses]: (Mbr, in
the “ Kámil; ” TA:) each clause ends with a
quiescent letter; and consists of at least two
words: (Kull p. 208:) [see an ex. in the first
paragraph of this art.:] you say also ↓ كَلَامٌ مُسَجَّعٌ
(S) and ↓ كَلَامٌ مَسْجُوعٌ, meaning the same as
سَجْعٌ: (TA:) the pl. of سَجْعٌ is أَسْجَاعٌ (S, K)
and , accord. to IJ, سُجُوعٌ, but ISd says, I know
not whether he have related this from another or
coined it, (TA,) and أَسَاجِيعُ, (S,) or this last is
pl. of ↓ أُسْجُوعَةٌ (K) [and is also a pl. pl., i. e. pl.
of أَسْجَاعٌ, like as أَزَاهِيرُ is pl. of أَزْهَارٌ which is pl.
of زَهْرٌ, and many similar instances might be
added, such instances being numerous app. because
أَفْعَالٌ is properly a measure of a pl. of paucity].
السَّجْعُ المُطَرَّفُ is That [rhyming prose] in which
the two words [that end two corresponding
clauses] agree in the letter of the سَجْع but not
in measure; as الرِّمَمْ and الأُمَمْ: and السَّجْعُ
المُتَوَازِى is that in which the measure is observed
in the two words as well as the letter of the
سَجْع; as القَلَمْ and القَسَمْ. (K T.) It is said in a
trad., that Mohammad forbade سَجْع in prayer:
[but many of the forms of prayer which he
himself prescribed, and many others commonly
used by Muslims in every age to the present time,
are سَجْع, and the Kur-án is a composition of the
same kind, though some do not allow this term
to be applied to it, because سَجْع is a highly
artificial style of prose-language, characterized
by a kind of rhythm as well as rhyme, and it is
obviously not proper to ascribe such artificial
language to God, nor is it proper to use it in
prayer, wherefore] Az says that سَجْع is disapproved in prayer because it resembles the
language of the diviners, or soothsayers, but
that other kinds of rhyming styles are allowable
in خُطَب and رَسَائِل. (TA.) He is also related
to have said, إِيَّاكُمْ وَ سَجْعَ الكُهَّانِ (tropical:)  [Avoid ye the
rhyming prose of the diviners, or soothsayers].
(TA.) One says also, ↓ بَيْنَهُمْ أُسْجُوعَةٌ [Between
them is a discourse, or colloquy, oral or written,
in rhyming prose]. (S.)
سِجْعٌ: see سَجَعَتِ الحَمَامَةُ: ―
-b2-  and see سَجْعٌ.
سَجُوعٌ: see سَاجِعٌ.
سَجَّاعٌ: see سَاجِعٌ.
سَجَّاعَةٌ: see سَاجِعٌ.
سَاجِعٌ Pursuing [an even, uniform, course, or]
a direct, or right, course, (AZ, S, K, TA,) in
going, or journeying, (AZ, S, TA,) [and] (tropical:)  in
speech, &c. (K, TA.) Dhu-r-Rummeh says,
قَطَعْتُ بِهَا أَرْضًا تَرَى وَجْهَ رَكْبِهَا
إِذَا مَا عَلَوْهَا مُكْفَأً غَيْرَ سَاجِعِ
i. e. [I traversed, or have traversed, with her a
land in which thou wouldst see the face of every
one of the company of travellers riding over it,
when they get upon it,] جَائِرًا غَيْرَ قَاصِدٍ [turning
aside from the right course, (or rather turned
aside, unless, which is not improbable, the right
reading be مُكْفِئًا,) not direct], (AZ, S, TA,) or
not direct towards one point: (TA:) but in the
O we find, as on the authority of AZ, غَيْرَ
سَاجِعِ غير جَائِرٍ عَنِ القَصْدِ [which is evidenily a
mistranscription; the right reading being غَيْرَ
سَاجِعِ أَىْ جَائِرًا عَنِ القَصْدِ, or the like]. (TA.)
―
-b2-  [Hence,] A face justly proportioned; [symmetrical;] well, or beautifully, formed. (K.) ―
-b3-
[Hence also,] حَمَامَةٌ سَاجِعَةٌ, and ↓ سَجُوعٌ, (K,)
without ة, (TA,) [A pigeon continuing its cry
uninterruptedly in one uniform way or manner;
or calling, and prolonging its voice or cry, modulating it sweetly: or cooing: (see 1:) or] reiterating its voice or cry: pl. [of the former or of
both] سُجَّعٌ and [of the former] سَوَاجِعُ. (K.) ―
-b4-
And نَاقَةٌ سَاجِعٌ A she-camel prolonging her
yearning cry in one uniform manner: (TA:) or
quavering, and prolonging her voice, [in the
copies of the K مُطْرِبَة, but correctly مُطَرِّبَة,] in
her yearning cry: (K:) or tall; (AA, K;) but
Az says, I have not heard this on any authority
beside that of AA. (TA.) ―
-b5-  [And hence,]
سَاجِعٌ also signifies (tropical:)  [A rhyming-proser, or
rhyming-prosaist;] one who speaks, or utters, [or
composes,] سَجْع: and in like manner, [↓ سَجَّاعٌ
(mentioned by Golius, and by Freytag as on the
authority of the K, in no copy of which do I find
it,) meaning one who speaks, or utters, or composes, سَجْع much: and] ↓ سَجَّاعَةٌ [meaning one
who does so very much: the three epithets being
similar to رَاجِزٌ and رَجَّازٌ and رَجَّازَةٌ]. (K, TA.)
أُسْجُوعَةٌ: see سَجْعٌ, in three places.
مَسْجَعٌ A place, or an object, [to which latter it
is applied in a phrase mentioned in the second
sentence of this art.,] of pursuit or aim; syn.
مَقْصِدٌ. (K.)
مُسَجَّعْ: see سَجْعٌ.
مَسْجُوعٌ: see سَجْعٌ.
