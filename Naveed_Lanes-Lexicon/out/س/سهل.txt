عَمْرَكَ اللّٰهَ كَيْفَ يَلْتَقِيَانِ

of God, (or, as it sometimes means, I ask God
to prolong thy life,) tell me, how can they meet
together? She is of the northern region when she
rises, and Suheyl, when he rises, is of the southern
region]. (Har p. 276. [But I have substituted
اللّٰهَ for اللّٰهُ, and يَمَانِى for يَمَانٍ. See also the
notice of the poet above named in the work of
Ibn-Khillikán: (I have the express authority of
the TA for thus writing this name:) and De
