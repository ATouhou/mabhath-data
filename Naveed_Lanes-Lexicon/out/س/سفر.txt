سَفِرَ, inf. n. سَفْرٌ, (M,
K,) He swept a house, or chamber, (S, M, A,

-b2-  And He, or it, [swept away;
or took away, or carried off, in every direction:
and] dispersed: (M, K:) and removed, took off,

covered. (M * A, * K.) You say, سَفَرَتِ الرِّيحُ
التُّرَابَ, and الوَرَقَ, (assumed tropical:)  The wind swept away the

سَفِرَ,
(M,) inf. n. سُفُورٌ, (M, Mgh,) meaning She removed her veil (M, A, Mgh) عَنْ وَجْهِهَا from her
face: (A, M:) and [elliptically] (M) she uncovered her face: (S, M, K:) [for] سَفَرْتُ الشَّىْءَ,
[being for سفرت عَنِ الشَّىْءِ,] aor.
سَفِرَ, inf. n. سَفْرٌ
[or سُفُورٌ?], signifies I uncovered the thing; made it
apparent, or manifest: (Mgh:) [but accord. to Mtr,]
the phrase تَسْفِرُ وَجْهَهَا [meaning she uncovers her
face] is of weak authority. (Mgh.) ―
-b3-  Hence,
i. e. from سَفَرَتْ meaning “ she uncovered her
face,” (M,) سَفَرْتُ بَيْنَ القَوْمِ, (S, M, Mgh, * Msb,

سَفُرَ,
(Msb,) inf. n. سُفُورٌ, (S,) or سَفَرٌ, (Msb,) [the
former of which inf. ns. perhaps indicates a radical
relation to سَفَرَتْ said of a woman, and of the
sun, expl. above,] He went forth to journey:
(S, Msb:) this verb, however, in this sense,
[which appears to have been unknown, or not
acknowledged, by the authors of the M and K,
(see مُسَافِرٌ,)] is obsolete; but its inf. n. سَفَرٌ is
used as a simple subst. (Msb. [See 3, the verb

prolong ye the prayer of daybreak until ye enter
upon the time when the dawn becomes white: (S,
TA:) some say that it relates especially to nights
in [the end of] which the moon shines, because in
such the commencement of daybreak is not

وَأُخْرَى بِذَاتِ الجَيْشِ آيَاتُهَاسِفْرُ
Skr says, [the poet means,] the marks, or traces,
thereof had become effaced: [accordingly, the
verse may be rendered, To Leylà there was in
Dhát-el-Beyn an abode that I knew, and another
in Dhát-el-Jeysh whereof the marks, or traces,
are effaced:] IJ says, [app. holding the meaning
to be, the marks, or traces, whereof are (like
those of) an ancient book, such as a portion of
the Mosaic Law,] the last word should be from
the phrase سَفَرْتُ البَيْتَ, i. e. “ I swept the house,
or chamber; ” as though the writing were swept
off from the طِرْس [or “ written paper ” or the
like, to which the poet seems to compare the site
of the abode in Dhát-el-Jeysh]. (M, TA.)
سَفَرٌ Journey, or travel; the act of journeying
or travelling; (S, A, K;) contr. of حَضَرٌ: (M,
K:) thus called because of the going and coming
in it, like the going and coming of the wind
sweeping away fallen leaves: (M:) or the act of
going forth to journey; an inf. n. used as a simple
subst.: (Msb:) [therefore] the pl. is أسْفَارٌ: (S,
M, A, Msb, K:) [and therefore it is often used
as a n. un.; but, properly speaking, the n. un. is
↓ سَفْرَةٌ:] you say, كَانَتْ سَفْرَتُهُ قَرِيبَةً [His journey
was near]: and the pl. of سَفْرَةٌ, accord. to rule,
is سَفَرَاتٌ. (Msb.) In law, [as relating to the
obligation of fasting &c.,] The going forth with
the intention of performing a journey of three
days and nights, or more. (KT.)
-A2-  Also The
whiteness of dawn or daybreak: (A:) or the
whiteness of the day: (S, M:) and i. q. صَبَاحٌ
[dawn, or morning, or forenoon; but app. here
used in the first of these senses]: (M:) and
↓ سَفِيرٌ, the whiteness [of the sky] before night:
(A, TA:) or the former, the remains of the
whiteness of day after sunset. (K.) You say
سَفَرًا i. e. صَبَاحًا [app. as meaning In the dawn].
(A.) And the prose-rhymer says, إِذَا طَلَعَتِ
الشِّعْرَى سَفَرًا لَمْ تَرَفِيهَا مَطَرًا (S, * TA) i. e. When
Sirius rises in the whiteness of day [meaning in
the clear twilight of morning, thou seest not then
rain: for Sirius rises aurorally, in Arabia, in the
middle and the latter half of July, when rain
scarcely ever falls there]. (S. [Accord. to the
TA, the meaning, app. taken without consideration from one of the foregoing explanations of
سَفَرٌ, is, when Sirius rises at nightfall: but this
is during the usual winter-rains.]) You say also,
لَقِيتُهُ سَفَرًا, and فِى سَفَرٍ, meaning ↓ عِنْدَاسْفِرَارِ
الشَّمْسِ لِلغُرُوبِ, thus related, with س [in the
word اسفرار (not with ص), and app. meaning
I met him when the sun was becoming white,
previously to the setting]. (M.) And بَقِىَ سَفَرٌ
مِنْ نَهَارٍ [There remained a white gleam of daylight]. (A.)
سَفْرَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
سُفْرَةٌ The food of the traveller; (M, K;) the
food that is prepared for the traveller, (S, Msb,)
or for a journey: (TA:) pl. َسُفَرٌ. (Msb.) This
is the primary signification. (TA.) You say,
أَكَلُوا السُّفْرَةَ They ate the food for the journey.
(A.) ―
-b2-  Hence, (tropical:)  The receptacle thereof; (TA;)
the piece of skin in which it is put. (S, * M, *
Msb, K, * TA.) [This is commonly of a round
form, with a running string; so that it is converted into a bag to contain the food, at one
time, and at another time is spread flat upon the
ground, when persons want to eat upon it.] ―
-b3-
And hence, (tropical:)  The thing [whatever it be] upon
which one eats: (TA:) [in the desert, it is generally a round piece of skin, such as I have
described above: in the towns, in the houses of
the middle classes, a round tray of tinned copper,
which is usually placed on a low stool; and in
the dwellings of some of the highest classes, and
the lowest, respectively, of silver and wood:]
accord. to the T, سُفْرَةٌ has the last of the significations given before this, and the thing which it
denotes is thus called because it is spread when
one eats upon it. (TA.)
