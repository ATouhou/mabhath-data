سفه1
سَفِهَ, (S, MA, Msb,) aor.
سَفَهَ; (Msb;) and
سَفُهَ, [aor.
سَفُهَ;] (S, Msb;) inf. n. سَفَهٌ and سَفَاهَةٌ
(S, MA, Msb, K *) and سَفَاهٌ, (S, MA, K, *) [all
mentioned in the MA as of the former verb, and
so in the TA when that verb is trans., but
properly] the first is of the former verb, and
the second is of the latter verb, (S, Msb,) and
so is the third; (S;) He (a man, S) was, or
became, such as is termed سَفِيه; (S, TA;) [i. e.]
he was, or became, unwise, witless, or destitute of
wisdom or understanding, or [rather] lightwitted.
(MA.) ―
-b2-  The phrase سَفِهَ نَفْسَةُ, [of which an
instance occurs in the Kur ii. 124, and] to which
غَبِنَ رَأْيَهُ and بَطِرَ عَيْضْلَرRَهُ and أَلِمَ بَطْنَهُ and وَفِقَ أَمْرَهُ
and رَضْلَرRِدَ أَمْرَهُ are similar, was originally سَفِهَتْ
نَفْسُ زَيْدٍ [or rather سَفِهَتْ نَفْسُهُ i. e. Himself, or
his mind, was, or became, lightwitted, &c.]; but
when [the dependence of] the verb became transferred [from the نفس] to the man, what followed
the verb was put in the accus. case by being its
objective complement, for the phrase became
identical in meaning with نَفْسَهُ ↓ سَفَّهَ [he made
himself, or his mind, lightwitted, &c.]: so say the
Basrees and Ks; and it is allowable with them to
make this accus. to precede [the verb]; like as it
is allowable to say, غُلَامَهُ ضَرَب زَيْدٌ: (S, TA:)
accord. to the K, the verb thus used has three
forms; (TA;) you say سَفِهَ نَفْسَهُ and رَأْيَهُ, (K,
TA,) and حِلْمَهُ, (TA,) and سَفُهَ, and سَفَهَ, meaning حَمَلَهُ عَلَىالسَّفَهِ [which is virtually the same
as سَفَّهَهُ i. e. he made himself, or his mind, lightwitted, or unwise, &c., and in like manner his
judgment, or opinion, and he made his gravity,
or forbearance, or the like, to become levity, or
hastiness, &c.]: or he attributed سَفَه [i. e. lightwittedness, &c., to himself, or his mind, and to
his judgment, or opinion]: or he destroyed it;
(K, TA;) agreeably with the meaning assigned
to سَفِهَ نَفْسَهُ by AO: (TA:) or this means he
held himself in mean, or light, estimation; (MA,
and Ksh and Bd in ii. 124;) and rendered himself low, base, or contemptible: (Bd ibid.:) but
Lh says that سَفِهَ نَفْسَهُ, with kesr [to the ف],
inf. n. سَفَهٌ and سَفَاهَةٌ and سَفَاهٌ, means حَمَلَهُ عَلَى
السَّفَهِ [or حَمَلَهَا], and is the approved form,
and that some say سَفُهَ, which is rare: and accord.
to J and others, (TA,) when they say سفه نَفْسَهُ, and
رَأْيَهُ, they do not say it otherwise than with kesr
[to the ف], because فَعُلَ is not trans.: (S, TA:)
so that the three forms of the verb mentioned in
the K require consideration: (TA:) accord. to
Fr, when [the dependence of] the verb in the
phrase سَفِهَ نَفْسَهُ became transferred from the
نفس to the possessor thereof, what followed the
verb became an explicative, to indicate that the
سَفَه [or lightwittedness, &c.,] was therein; and by
rule it should be سَفِهَ زَيْدٌ نَفْسًا, for the explicative
should not be otherwise than indeterminate; but
it was left in its state of a prefixed noun, and put
in the accus. case in the manner of an indeterminate noun as being likened thereto; [the meaning, therefore, accord. to him, is he was, or
became, lightwitted, &c., as to his mind;] it is
not allowable, however, in his opinion, to make
this accus. to precede [the verb], because the explicative may not precede; and similar to this is
the phrase ضِقْتُ بِهِ ذَرْعًا, and طِبْتُ بِهِ نَفْسًا, meaning ضَاقَ ذَرْعِىبِهِ and طَابَتْ نَفْسِى بِهِ: (S, TA:)
but this saying [of Fr] is disallowed by the
grammarians; for they say that explicatives are
indeterminate, and that determinate nouns may
not be used as indeterminate: some of the grammarians say that إِلَّامَنْ سَفِهَ نَفْسَهُ in the Kur
[ii. 124] means الّا من سَفِهَ فِىنَفْسِهِ [but he who
is lightwitted, &c., in his mind], i. e., who becomes
سَفِيه; [the prep.] فى being suppressed [and the
noun therefore put in the accus. case agreeably
with a general rule]: Zj holds that the approvable saying is, that it means إِلَّا مَنْ جَهِلَ نَفْسَهُ,
i. e., but he who is [ignorant or silly or foolish or]
unreflecting in his mind: and in like manner,
سَفِهَ رَأْيَهُ means جَهِلَهُ [i. e. he was ignorant, &c.,
in his judgment, or opinion]; and his judgment,
or opinion, was unsound, without rectitude: and
سَفِهَ نَفْسَهُ signifies also he lost himself, or his own
soul. (TA.) سَفِهَ الحَقَّ is likewise expl. as meaning الحَقَّ ↓ سَفَّهَ [He made the truth, or right, to
be foolishness, or the like]; and Yoo held the one
to be a dial. var. of the other, and the measure of
the former verb to denote intensiveness; and
accord. to this explanation one may say, سَفِهْتُ
زَيْدًا meaning زَيْدًا ↓ سَفَّهْتُ [I pronounced Zeyd
lightwitted, &c.]: or the meaning is جَهِلَ الحَقَّ
[he ignored the truth, or right], and he did not
see it to be the truth, or right: (TA:) or he regarded the truth, or right, as foolishness, or ignorance. (S and TA in art. غمط.) See also 2. ―
-b3-
سَفِهَ عَلَيْهِ signifies جَهِلَ [i. e., when thus trans.
by means of عَلَى, He feigned ignorance to him];
as also سَفُهَ, (K, TA,) and ↓ تسافه. (K.) ―
-b4-  And
سَفِهْتُ نَصِيبِى [and it is implied in the K that
one says سَفَهْتُ نصيبى also, but only the former
is authorized by the TA,] I forgot my share, or
portion. (Th, K, TA.) ―
-b5-  And سَفَهَ صَاحِبَهُ, aor.
سَفُهَ,
He overcame his companion in what is termed
مُسَافَهَة [inf. n. of 3, q. v.]. (K.) You say, ↓ سَافَهَهُ
فَسَفَهَهُ. (TA.) ―
-b6-  سَفِهَتِ الطَّعْنَةُ, (JK, K, TA,)
inf. n. سَفَهٌ, (TA,) (tropical:)  The spear-wound, or the like,
emitted blood which came from it quickly (JK,
K, TA) and dried up (وَجَفَّ [in the TK وِخف]):
(K, TA:) so in the A. (TA.) ―
-b7-  سَفِهَ الضْلَرRَّرَابَ,
(S, K,) inf. n. سَفَهٌ, (TA,) He drank much of
the beverage, or wine, without having his thirst
satisfied thereby. (S, K, TA.) See also 3. And
سَفِهَ المَآءَ (tropical:)  He drank the water immoderately.
(TA.) ―
-b8-  And سَفِهْتُ and سَفَهْتُ signify ضْلَرRُغِلْتُ,
(so in the CK,) in [some of] the copies of the K
ضْلَرRَغَلْتُ, but the right reading is ضْلَرRُغِلْتُ [i. e. I was
occupied, or busied, or diverted from a thing]:
or, accord. to the copies of the K, تَضْلَرRَغَّلْتُ; but
correctly, or ضْلَرRَغَلْتُ [i. e. I occupied, or busied, or
diverted from a thing]. (TA.)
2
سَفَّهَ see 5. ―
-b2-  [Hence,] سِفِهِهُ, inf. n. تَسْفِيهٌ, (S,
Msb, K,) signifies جَعَلَهُ سَفِيهًا [i. e. He, or it,
made him to be, or he pronounced him to be,
lightwitted, &c.]; as also ↓ سَفِهَهُ; (K, TA;) on
the authority of Akh and Yoo: (TA:) or he
attributed to him what is termed سَفَه [i. e. lightwittedness, &c.]: (S, Msb:) or he said to him
that he was such as is termed سَفِيه. Msb.) And
سفّه الجَهْلُ حِلْمَهُ Ignorance made him light, inconstant, unsteady, irresolute, or fickle; syn.
أَطَاضْلَرRَهُ and أَخَفَّهُ. (TA.) See also 1, in three
places.
3
سافههُ, (S, MA, K,) inf. n. مُسَافَهَةٌ, (S, KL,)
He acted [in a lightwitted manner,] foolishly, or
ignorantly, with him; (MA, KL;) showed lightness, levity, weakness of mind, and lack of حِلْم
[or gravity, &c.], with him. (KL.) You say,

[سافهه in this instance may mean as above, or
may have the meaning here next following.] ―
-b2-
He reviled him; or he reviled him, being reviled
by him; syn. ضْلَرRَاتَمَهُ: whence the prov., سَفِيهٌ لَمْ

reviler, or mutual reviler]; (K, TA;) mentioned
in the S. (TA.) [See also 5.] ―

And سَافَهَتِ النَّاقَةُ الطَّرِيقَ (tropical:)  The she-camel kept to
the road, or way, (A, K, TA,) or took to it, (A,
TA,) with a vehement pace: (A, K, TA:) or

4
أَسْفَهْتُهُ I found him to be سَفِيه [i. e. lightwitted, &c.]. (TA. [There said to be tropical;
but I see not why.]) ―
-b2-  أَسْفَهَكَ اللّٰه الضْلَرRَّرَابَ (assumed tropical:)  May
God make thee to drink of the beverage, or wine,
without having thy thirst satisfied thereby: or
أَسْفَهَهُ اللّٰهُ God made him, or may God make
him, to drink without having his thirst satisfied:
(S, accord. to different copies:) or اسفه اللّٰهُ فُلَانَّا
المَآءَ God made, or may God make, such a one to
drink much water. (TA.)
5
تسفّهت الرِّيَاحُ The winds became in a state
of commotion. (TA.) ―
-b2-  تسفّهت الرِّيحُ الضْلَرRَّجَرَ,
(S,) or الغُصُونَ, (K, TA,) and الرِّيحُ ↓ سَفَّهَتِ
الغُصُونَ, (Ham p. 359,) The wind made the trees,
(S,) or the branches, (K,) to bend, or incline:
(S, K:) and put the branches in motion: (K,
and Ham ubi suprà:) or ruffled, and put in
motion, the branches. (TA. [There said to be
tropical: but see what is said of the primary
signification of سَفَهٌ, below.]) ―
-b3-  [Hence,] it is
said in a prov., فُرَارَةٌ تَسَفَّهَتْ قَرَارَةً A lamb, or kid,
made a sheep, or goat, to incline [to silly behaviour]: applied to the old whom the young
incites to lightwittedness (السَّفَه) and levity.
(Meyd. [See also a similar prov. in Freytag's
Arab. Prov., ii. 253.]) ―

(S, K.) ―
-b5-  تسفّه عَلَيْهِ He acted with سَفَاهَة [i. e.

verse of Khalaf Ibn-Is-hák El-Bahránee, [describing swift camels,] means Their sides of the
mouth casting forth their foam, one at another:
like the saying of El-Jarmee,
تَسَافَهُ أَضْلَرRْدَاقُهَا بِاللُّغَامِ
[Their sides of the mouth casting forth the foam,
one at another]. (TA. [تسافه, there written
without any syll. signs, is app. thus, (for تَتَسَافَهُ,)
not تُسَافِهُ.])
سَفَهٌ, (S, TA,) as also ↓ سَفَاهَةٌ and ↓ سَفَاهٌ, (TA,)
[all mentioned as inf. ns. in the first paragraph of
this art.,] primarily signifies خِفَّةٌ [in its proper
sense of Lightness], and motion, commotion, or
agitation. (S, TA.) ―
-b2-  And hence (S, TA) the
first, (S, K, TA,) like each of the others, (K,
TA,) signifies [generally Lightwittedness, or the
like;] the contr. of حِلْمٌ; (S, K, TA;) [i. e.] خِفَّةٌ
[as meaning lightness or levity, inconstancy,
unsteadiness, irresoluteness; or lightness or levity,
&c., and hastiness; for, as is said in the TA in
art. رجح, the contr. of حِلْمٌ is described by the
terms خِفَّةٌ and عَجَلٌ, like as حِلْمٌ is described by
the term ثِقَلٌ]; and slenderness, shallowness, or
weakness, of judgment; qualities which deficiency
of intellect, or understanding, necessarily involves:
(Bd in ii. 12, in explanation of سَفَهٌ:) or خِفَّةُ حِلْمٍ
[i. e. slightness of gravity or staidness or sedateness or calmness &c.]: or جَهْلٌ [i. e. ignorance,
or silliness or foolishness]: (K, TA:) all of which
explanations are nearly alike: (TA:) or سَفَهٌ is a
deficiency in intellect or understanding: (Msb:)
or a lightness, or levity, accidental to a man,
arising from joy or anger, inducing him to act
unreasonably and unlawfully. (KT.)
سَفَاهٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
سَفيِهٌ [Having the quality termed سَفَهٌ; i. e.,
accord. to the explanation of the primary signification of the latter, above, Light; and in a state
of motion, commotion, or agitation:] applied to a
camel's nose-rein, (S, K,) light: (S:) or quivering; (K, TA;) because of the she-camel's shaking
it, and contending in pulling it. (TA: but there
said to be, when thus applied, tropical.) Dhu-rRummeh says,
عَلَى ظَهْرِ مِقْلَاتٍ سَفِيهٍ جَدِيلُهَا
i. e. [Upon the back of a she-camel that had
brought forth but once and not conceived after,]
whose nose-rein was light. (S. In the TA,
زِمَامُهَا is here put in the place of جَدِيلُهَا.) And
one says also نَاقَةٌ سَفِيهَةُ الزِمَامِ, (K, TA,) meaning
[A she-camel whose nose-rein is light, or quivering:
or] light, or agile, in pace or going. (TA: in
which this, also, is said to be tropical.) ―
-b2-  Also
Lightwitted; light of intellect or understanding;
(TA;) deficient in intellect or understanding;
(Msb;) ignorant; (Mujáhid, K, TA;) weak;
foolish, stupid, unsound in intellect or understanding, dull therein, or having little, or no,
intellect, or understanding; (Mujáhid, TA;) and
↓ سَافِهٌ, also, [which is syn. with سَفِيهٌ in all the
senses mentioned above,] is expl. by IAar as
having this last meaning of foolish, stupid, &c.:
(TA:) the fem. is سَفِيهَةٌ: (Msb, K:) and the pl.
of the masc., (K,) or of the masc. and fem.,
(Msb, TA,) is سُفَهَآءُ, (Msb, K, TA,) and of both,
سِفَاهٌ, and of the fem., سَفِيهَاتٌ also and سَفَائِهُ and
سُفَّهٌ. (K, TA.) In the Kur ii. 282, سَفِيهًا means,
accord. to Ibn-'Arafeh, Ignorant of the ordinances, or statutes; one who does not dictate well,
and knows not what dictation is; for he who is
ignorant in all his circumstances may not deal
with another upon credit: accord. to ISd, ignorant
or صَغِير [meaning under the age of puberty]; not
ignorant of dictating, as Lh asserts it to mean,
because it is added, “or not able to dictate, himself: ” this, says Er-Rághib, denotes سَفَه in respect of worldly matters: in the Kur lxxii. 4,
سَفِيهُنَا denotes سَفَه in religion. (TA.) In the
Kur iv. 4, the pl. السُّفَهَآء is said to mean Women,
and young children; because they are ignorant
of the proper object of expense: and I'Ab is
related to have said that women are termed السُّفَّهُ
and السُّفَهَآءُ: (Lh, TA:) Az, also, says that a
woman is termed سَفِيهَةٌ because of the weakness
of her intellect, and because she does not manage
well her property; and in like manner are termed
children as long as they are not known to be
characterized by maturity of intellect, and rectitude of actions, and good management of affairs.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  ثَوْبٌ سَفِيهٌ (tropical:)  A garment, or piece of
cloth, badly woven; thin, flimsy, unsubstantial,
or scanty in the yarn. (K, * TA.)
سَفَاهَةٌ: see سَفَهٌ.
سَافِهٌ: see سَفيهٌ. ―
-b2-  Also, applied to a man,
(assumed tropical:)  Vehemently thirsty: and so سَاهِفٌ. (Az, TA.)
وَادٍ مُسْفَهٌ (tropical:)  A valley filled [with water]: (K,
TA:) as though it exceeded the due bounds, and
became such as is termed سَفِيه: imagined to be
from أسْفَهْتُهُ signifying “ I found him to be سَفِيه. ”
(TA.)
طَعَامٌ مَسْفَهَةٌ, (K, TA, in the CK [erroneously]
مُسْفِهٌ,) as also مَسْهَفَةٌ, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  Food that incites
[in the CK يُتْعِبُ is erroneously put for يَبْعَتُ] to
the drinking of much water. (IAar, * K, TA.)

سفو and سفى
1
سَفَا, (S, M,) aor. يَسْفُو, inf. n. سُفُوُّ, (S, TA,)

(K,) a dial. var. of weak authority, mentioned by
Sgh on the authority of Fr; (TA;) [or it may be
thus expl. by a mistake originating from the fact
that] IAar mentions سَفَتِ الرِّيحُ and أسْفَتْ, [as
syn.,] but [in a sense to be expl. hereafter,] not
making either of them trans.: (M:) [and ↓ سَافَتِ
الرِّيحُ التُّرَابَ occurs in the M and L in art. سنف:]
and تَسْفِي بِهِ, relating to the wind and the dust,
also occurs; the ب being redundant, or added
because the verb implies the meaning of رَمَت
[which is trans. by means of بِ]. (Mgh.) ―
-b2-
And سَفَتِ الرِيحُ The wind blew; as also ↓ أسْفَت.
(IAar, TA.) And سَفَتْ عَلَيْهِ الرِيَاحُ [The winds

سَفَآءٌ, He was, or became, lightwitted; or unwise,
witless, or destitute of wisdom or understanding;
i. q. سَفِهَ, inf. n. سَفَهٌ and سَفَاهٌ; (M, K;) as also
↓ اسفى. (Az, K.)
3
سافت الرِيحُ التُّرَابَ: see 1.
-A2-  سافاهُ, (S, K,)
inf. n. مُسَافَاةٌ and سِفَآءٌ, i. q. سَافَهَهُ [He acted in a
lightwitted manner, foolishly, or ignorantly, with
him]. (S, K.)
-A3-  And He treated him medically,
or curatively: (K:) from سَفَآءٌ. (TA. [But see

awn, or extremities]. (M, K.) ―
-b3-  And اسفى
said of a man, He took the prickles [or awn or
extremities] of the بُهْمَى [or barley-grass]. (TA.)
-A4-  Also, said of a man, He removed dust, or
earth, (سَفًا, TA) from one place to another.
(Az, K.)
-A5-  And اسفت said of a she-camel, (tropical:)  She
became lean, or emaciated, (K,) so that she was
like the سَفا [or prickles of barley-grass]. (TA.)
-A6-  See also 1, last sentence.
-A7-  اسفاهُ It (an
affair, or event, M) incited him (a man, K) to
unsteadiness, and levity. (M, K.) ―
-b2-  And hence,
perhaps, (M,) اسفى بِهِ He did evil or ill, or
acted ill, to him, or with him, (M, K,) i. e., his
companion. (M.)
8
استفى وَجْهَهُ i. q. اِصْطَرَفَهُ, (Sgh, K,) i. e. He

in which it is discommended, (S, * Z, Mgh,) and
of the mule and ass, in both of which it is commended: (Z, Mgh:) or shortness, and scantiness,
of the forelock: accord. to Th, it is ↓ سَفَآءٌ, with
medd: which is metaphorically used by a poet
as meaning scantiness in milk. (M.) [Accord.

the verb is ↓ سَفِىَ, said of a horse, as meaning
He was, or became, light, thin, or scanty, in the
forelock.] ―
-b2-  And, accord. to IAar, A whiteness

art. سفو.)
-A2-  Also, [but more properly written
سَفًى, the last radical in this case being ىِ,]
Dust, or earth; (S, M, K;) and so ↓ سَافٍ:
(TA:) or this is applied to earth, or dust, [as
meaning pouring down,] from سَفَى التُّرَابُ [expl.
above]: (Ham p. 454:) the former signifies dust,
or earth, though not raised and carried away, or
dispersed, by the wind: or, accord. to the T,
whatever is raised and carried away, or dispersed, by the wind: (TA:) accord. to IAar,
dust, or earth, taken forth from a grave or a
well: (M:) سَفَاةٌ is a more special term, (S,) the
n. un., (M,) سَفَاةٌ مِنْ تُرَابٍ signifying a collection
(كُبَّةٌ) of dust, or earth. (Ham p. 810.)
-A3-  Also

taken from what here follows:]) the prickles [or
awn or beard] of بُهْمَى [or barley-grass], (S, M,)
and of the ears of corn, [of wheat or barley,
(TA in art. خدضْلَرR,)] and of anything having
prickles: accord. to Th, the extremities of بُهْمَى:
n. un. سَفَاةٌ, as above. (M.)
-A4-  Also Leanness,
or emaciation, (K, TA,) in consequence of disease.
(TA.)
-A5-  It is also an inf. n. of سَفِىَ as syn. with
سَفِهَ, expl. above. (M, K.)
سَفَآءٌ: see the first sentence of the next preceding
paragraph: it is expl. in the K [and also in the
M] as signifying A stopping, stopping short, or
ceasing, of the she-camel's milk: and ISd cites
[in the M, after Th], from a poet, the phrase
فَى أَلْبَانِهِنَّ سَفَآءُ [ending a verse,] referring to
[she-camels such as are termed] قَلَائِص: but Az
relates it differently, فِى أَلْبابِهِنَّ with ب [in the
place of ن]; saying that سَفَآءٌ means lightness, or
levity, in anything; and ignorance; and that the
phrase, as he cites it, means in whose faculties of
understanding is lightness. (TA.) [See 1, last
sentence: and] see also what next follows.
سِفَآءٌ, accord. to the K, signifies A medicine, or
remedy: [see 3, last signification:] but this
requires consideration; for it is said in the M,
[↓ السَّفَآءُ signifies unsteadiness, and levity; and
IAar says,] السَّفَآءُ from السَّفِىُّ is like الضْلَرRَّقَآءُ from
الضْلَرRَّقِىُّ. (TA.)
سَفِىُّّ Dust raised, or made to fly, and carried
away, or dispersed, by the wind; (S, K;) and
(K) so ↓ سَافٍ, (M, K,) i. q. ↓ مَسْفِىٌّ; a possessive
epithet, or of the measure فَاعِلٌ in the sense of the
measure مَفْعُولٌ. (M. [See another explanation
of سَاف voce سَفًا, from the Hamáseh. Freytag
explains both سَفِىٌّ and سَافٍ, as on the authority
of the K, as epithets applied to the wind, not to
the dust.]) ―
-b2-  Also Clouds; [app. as being driven
by the wind;] syn. سَحَابٌ. (S.)
-A2-  And i. q. سَفِيهٌ
[Lightwitted, &c.: see 1, last sentence]. (M, K.)
[And it seems to be indicated in the S that ↓ سَافٍ
is syn. with سَافِهٌ, which is syn. with سَفِيهٌ.]
سَفَّآءٌ: see مُسْفٍ.
سَافٍ: fem. سَافِيَةٌ, pl. سَوَافٍ: see this last in the
next paragraph: ―
-b2-  and for the first, see سَفًا: and
سَفِىٌّ, first sentence.
-A2-  See also سَفِىٌّ again, last
sentence.
سَافِيَآءُ Dust, syn. غُبَارٌ: (M, K:) or dust (تُرَابٌ)
and dry herbage or the like: (Ham p. 445:) or
dust (تُرَابٌ) with the wind: (M:) or wind that
bears, or carries, or carries away, dust, (M, K,
TA,) much, upon the surface of the earth, impelling it against men: (TA, and in like manner
in the Ham ubi suprà:) and ↓ رِيَاحٌ سَوَافٍ, (TA,)
pl. of رِيحٌ سَافِيَةٌ, (Ham ubi suprà,) winds that
raise the dust, or make it to fly, and carry it
away, or disperse it: you say, لَعِبَتْ بِهِ السَّوَافَى
[The winds raising the dust, &c., made sport with
him, or it]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Also Tracks, or streaks,
upon a pool put in motion by the wind: so says
Freytag; but he names not any authority for
this.]
أسْفَى applied to a horse, (As, S, M, Mgh,)
Light, thin, or scanty, in the hair of the forelock:
(As, S, M, Mgh, K:) or short and scanty therein:
fem. سَفْوَآءُ: (M:) [and accord. to some, it seems
to be in like manner applied to a mule and an ass:
(see سَفًا:)] one says فَرَسٌ أَسْفَى and بَغْلَةٌ سَفْوَآءُ:
(Mgh:) [or,] accord. to As, أَسْفَى in the sense
first expl. above is not applied to anything but a
horse: applied to a mule, it means (assumed tropical:)  quick, or
swift: (S:) or بَغْلَةٌ سَفْوَآءُ signifies (tropical:)  a she-mule
that is quick, or swift, (S, M, A, K, TA,) like the
wind, (A, TA,) active, or light, (S,) of middling
make, compact and strong in the back; (M, TA;)
and in like manner سَفْوَآءُ is applied to a wild she-ass. (M.) ―
-b2-  Accord. to IAar, الأَسْفَى applied to
the horse signifies اَلَّذِي تَنْزِعُهُ ضْلَرRَعَرَةٌ بَيْضَآءُ [app.
meaning Distinguished by some white hairs,
though I find no authority for thus rendering the
verb here used] whether he be bay or of some
other colour: or having that whiteness of the
hair which is termed سَفًا [expl. above], which is
particularly said by him in one place to be in
such as is termed أَدْهَم, and such as is أَضْلَرRْقَر: and
the fem. in this sense also is as above. (M.) ―
-b3-
One says also رِيحٌ هَوْجَآءُ, meaning (tropical:)  A swift wind;
like as one says مُسْفٍ. (TA.)
مُسْفٍ [and, accord. to Golius, ↓ سَفَّآءٌ, mentioned
by him as on the authority of the K, in which,
however, I do not find it, nor did Freytag,] A
calumniator, or slanderer. (K.)
مَسْفِىٌّ: see سَفِىٌّ.
