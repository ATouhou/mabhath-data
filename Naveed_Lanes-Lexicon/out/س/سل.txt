out or forth from another thing: (Jel in xxiii. 12:)
or he pulled out the thing, or drew it forth, gently:

[In the morning when ye turned back, as though
your swords were ذآنين (pl. of ذُؤْنُونٌ a species
of fungus) upon your necks, (for the sword was
hung upon the shoulder, not by a waist-belt,) not
drawn forth], he has separated the doubled letter:
thus the verse is related by IAar: but by Th,
↓ لَمْ تَسَلَّلِ [for تَتَنَسَلَّلِ]. (M.) It is said in a trad.,
لَأَسُلَّنَّكَ مِنْهُمْ كَمَا تُسَلُّ الشَّعْرَةُ مِنَ العَجِينِ [I will
assuredly draw thee forth from them like as the
single hair is drawn forth from dough]. (TA.)
And in another trad., اَللّٰهُمَّ أْسْلُلْ سَخِيمَةَ قَلْبِى
(tropical:)  [O God, draw forth the rancour of my heart]:
and hence the saying الهَدَايَا تَسُلُّ السَّخَائِمَ وَتَحُلُّ
الشَّكَائِمَ (tropical:)  [Presents draw away feelings of rancour, and loose, or melt, resistances, or incompliances]. (TA.) And سُلَّ, said of a colt, means
He was drawn forth a سَلِيل [q. v.]. (M,
TA.) ―
-b2-  Also He took the thing. (Msb.) Hence
one says, تُسَلُّ المَيِّتُ مِنْ قِبَلِ رَأْسِهِ إِلَى القَبْرِ, i. e.
[The dead body] is taken [head-foremost to the

sheep or goat, شاة; (M;) He, or it, lost his, or

to steal, or to steal covertly, secretly, or clandestinely. (TA.) ―
-b5-  [See also إِسْلَالٌ below. Accord. to Freytag, اسلّ signifies He received a
bribe: but this requires consideration: he gives
no authority but the K, which does not justify
this explanation.]
-A2-  اسلّهُ He (God) caused him
to be affected with the disease termed سِلّ [q. v.].
(S, M, Msb, K.)

-b2-  Also i. q. اِضْطَرَبَ [It
was, or became, in a state of commotion, agitation, &c.]; said of a thing; as though it were
imagined to be repeatedly drawn forth. (Er-Rághib, TA.)
7
انسلّ It (a thing) became pulled out, or
drawn forth, gently; (M;) it became drawn, or
pulled out or forth, as a sword from its scabbard,
and a hair from dough. (Mgh.) You say, انسلّ
السَّيْفُ مِنَ الغَمْدِ The sword [became drawn from
the scabbard: or] slipped out from the scabbard.
(TA.) And انسلّ قِيَادُالفَرَسِ مِنْ يَدِهِ [The leading-rope of the horse slipped out or] came forth
[from his hand]. (Mgh.) ―
-b2-  And [hence], as
also ↓ تسلّل, (S, M, K,) He slipped away, or
stole away; i. e., went away covertly, secretly, or
clandestinely: (M, K:) or he went forth, مِنْ
بَيْنِهِمْ [from among them]. (S.) And اِنْسَلَلْتُ
مِنْ بَيْنِ يَدَيْهِ I went away, and went forth, deliberately, or leisurely, and by degrees, from before
him. (TA.) Sb says that اِنْسَلَلْتُ [used in this
or a similar sense] is not a quasi-pass. verb; but
is only like [a verb of the measure] فَعَلْتُ; like
as اِفْتَقَرَ is like ضَعُفَ. (M.) It is said in a prov.,
رَمَتْنِى بِدَائِهَاوَانْسَلَّتْ [She reproached me with
her own fault, and slipped away]: (S, Meyd,
TA:) [originally] said by one of the fellow-wives
of Ruhm, daughter of El-Khazraj, wife of Saad
Ibn-Zeyd-Menáh, on Ruhm's reproaching her
with a fault that was in herself. (Meyd, TA.
[See also Freytag's Arab. Prov. cap. x. no. 2;

-b3-  And تَسَلْسُلٌ signifies (assumed tropical:)  The glistening, and [apparent] creeping,

sword. (TA. [See also أَثْرٌ.]) ―
-b4-  And تَسَلْسَلَ said
of a garment, (assumed tropical:)  It was worn until it became thin;

erroneous term of the vulgar, and that the latter
is the right term, (TA,) signify the same, (S, M,
K,) as also ↓ سُلٌّ and ↓ سَلَّةٌ, (K,) [Consumption:

(تُعَقِّبُ [grammatically referring to سَلَّة]) either

ذَات الجَنْب [i. e. pleurisy]: (in the CK, بِعَقَبِ
ذات الرِّيّةِ اوذاتِ الجَنْبِ is [erroneously] put in
the place of تُعَقِّبُ ذَاتَ الرِّئَةِ أَوْ ذَاتَ الجَنْبِ: and
in what here follows, the gen. case is put in the
place of the nom. in four instances:) or a rheum

of swords]. (S, M, K.) ―
-b2-  And Theft: (S, Msb:)
or covert, secret, or clandestine, theft; (M, K;)

covert theft]. (TA.)
-A2-  Also (tropical:)  The rush (دُفْعَة)
of a horse among other horses, in running:
(TA:) or the rush (دُفْعَة) of a horse in striving
to outstrip: (S, TA: [I read فِى سِبَاقِهِ, as in a
copy of the S; instead of فى سِيَاقِهِ, as in other
copies of the S and in the TA:]) so in the saying,
فَرَسٌ شَدِيدُ السَّلَّةِ (tropical:)  [A horse of which the rush &c.
is vehement]: (S, TA:) and خَرَجَتْ سَلَّتُهُ عَلَى

horses]. ―
-b2-  And A revulsion of shortness of
breathing (اِرْتِدَادُ رَبْوٍ) in the chest of a horse, in
consequence of his suppressing such shortness of
breathing [so I render مِنْ كَبْوَةٍ يَكْبُوهَا, but this
phrase admits of other renderings, as will be seen
in art. كبو]: (M, K:) when he is inflated
thereby, one says, أَخْرَجَ سَلَّتَهُ [app. meaning he
has manifested his revulsion of shortness of breathing]; and thereupon he is urged to run with
vehemence, and made to sweat, and coverings
are thrown upon him, and that shortness of
breathing (ذٰلِكَ الرَّبْوُ) passes forth. (M.) ―

حَوَرٌ:) in the present day commonly applied to a
basket made of twigs, oblong and deep, generally
between a foot and a foot and a half in length:]
and ↓ سَلٌّ signifies the same: (M, K:) what is
termed سَلَّةُ الخُبْزِ [the bread-basket] is well
known: (S:) سَلَّةٌ meaning as expl. above is not
thought by IDrd to be an Arabic word: (M:)
[the dim. ↓ سُلَيْلَةٌ occurs in the K voce جُونَةٌ, and
in the Mgh voce رَبْعَةٌ, &c.:] the pl. is سِلَالٌ (M,
K) and سَلَّاتٌ (Msb) and [coll. gen. n.] ↓ سَلٌّ, of
which Abu-l-Hasan says that it is in his opinion
a rare kind of pl. [or coll. gen. n.] because it
denotes what is made by art, not created, and it
should more properly be regarded as of the class
of كَوْكَبٌ and كَوْكَبَةٌ [which are syn.] because
this is more common than the class of سَفِينَةٌ and
سَفِينٌ. (M.)
-A5-  Also A fault, or defect, in a water-ing-trough or tank, or in a [jar of the kind called]
خَابِيَة: (M, K:) or a breach between the أَنْصَابِ,

with ة a filly; (S, * M, TA;) the ة being affixed,
though سليل is of the measure فَعِيلٌ in the sense
of the measure مَفْعُولٌ, because the word is made
a subst.: (Ham p. 102:) or, as some say, (M, in
the K “ and ”) the former signifies a colt that is
born not in a [membrane such as is called] مَاسِكَة
nor [in one such as is called] سَلًى: if in either

or particles of rubbish or the like, and from
turbidness; of the measure فَعِيلٌ in the sense of

descent] in the throat, or fauces. (TA.) [See

(En-Nadr, K, TA.) One says سَلِيلٌ مِنْ سَمُرٍ
