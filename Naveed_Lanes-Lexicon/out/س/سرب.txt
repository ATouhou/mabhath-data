and he went away. (M.) You say, سَرَبَ فِى الأَرْضِ,
(M, A, Mgh, Msb,) aor. as above, (M, Msb,) and
so the inf. n., (M, A, Msb,) He went away [into
the country, or in the land]. (M, A, Mgh, Msb.)
And سَرَبَ فِى حَاجَتِهِ He went, or went away,
(A'Obeyd, M,) or, as some say, during the day,
(M,) for the accomplishment of his want.

حَوَائِجِهِ [He goes, or goes away, all the day,
accomplishing his wants]. (A.) ―
-b2-  سَرَبَ [or rather
سَرَبَ فِى الأَرْضِ] also signifies He (a man) went
away at random into the country, or in the land.
(Har pp. 448 and 511.) A poet says, (S,) namely,
Keys Ibn-El-Khateem, (TA,)
↓ أَنَّى سَرَبْتِ وَكُنْتِ غَيْرَ سَرُوبِ
[i. e. Whence hast thou gone away at random?
for thou wast not one wont to go away at
random:] (S, TA:) thus, سربت, as related by
IDrd: accord. to others, [سَرَيْتِ,] with ى.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  سَرَبَتِ الإِبِلُ, aor. and inf. n. as above,
The camels went away into the country, or in the
land, going forth whithersoever they would: and
in like manner سَرَبَ is said of a stallion [camel]':
(Az, TA:) or سَرَبَ, (S, K,) said of a stallion
[camel], aor. as above, (S,) and so the inf. n.,
signifies he repaired, or betook himself, to the
place of pasture: (S, A, K:) and سَرَبَ المَالُ,
aor.
سَرُبَ, inf. n. سَرْبٌ, the camels, or cattle, pastured

-b4-
سَرَبَ المَآءُ, (A, Mgh, Msb,) aor. as above, (Msb,)
inf. n. سُرُوبٌ; (Mgh, Msb;) or سَرِبَ, [aor.
سَرَبَ,]
inf. n. سَرَبٌ; (M;) The water ran (A, Mgh)
upon the surface of the ground: (A:) or flowed;
as also ↓ انسرب: (M:) [or the latter signifies it
ran swiftly: (see Har p. 586:)] and in like
manner one says of the سَرَاب [or mirage], يَسْرَبُ,
inf. n. سَرَبٌ, it runs. (AHeyth, TA.) And
سَرِبَتِ العَيْنُ, inf. n. سَرَبٌ; and سَرَبَتْ, aor.

water-bag] flowed. (S, K.) And خَرَجَ المَآءُ سَرَبًا
The water came forth from the punctures made
in sewing the skin. (TA.) [Or] سَرِبَتْ said of a
new [water-skin such as is termed] قِرْبَة, or of a
مَزَادَة, signifies It had water poured into it in
order that the thong [with which it was sewed]
might become moistened, so as to swell, and fill
up the holes made in the sewing. (M.) ―
-b5-  See
also سَرَبٌ, below. ―
-b6-  [Golius explains سَرَبَ, inf. n.
سَرَبَانٌ, as on the authority of the KL, as signifying “ Ingressus fuit in rem, totum subivit implevitve
locum: ” but this is a mistake, evidently occasioned by his finding سَرَبَانٌ, explained in this
sense, instead of سَرَيَان, the reading in my copy
of the KL.]
-A2-  سَرْبٌ [as an inf. n.] is [also] syn.
with خَرْزٌ [signifying The sewing of a skin or the
like]. (Kr, K, TA. [In a copy of the M, I find
السَّرَبُ الخَرَزُ erroneously written for السَّرْبُ الخَرْزُ.])
You say, سَرَبْتُ القِرْبَةَ, inf. n. سَرْبٌ, I sewed the
قربة [i. e. water-skin, or milk-skin]. (TK.)

(TA,) He became affected with suppression of
the feces, or constipation of the bowels, (أَخَذَهُ حُصْرٌ
or حَصَرٌ accord. to different copies of the K,) by

أُسْرُبٌّ] into the innermost parts of his nose, and
other passages, (K,) or into his mouth, and the
innermost parts of his nose, and his anus, (M, *
TA,) and other passages: (TA:) the epithet applied to a man thus affected is ↓ مَسْرُوبٌ: (K:)
sometimes he recovers, and sometimes he dies.
(TA.)

سَرَّبَ [سرّب app. signifies, primarily, He sent
camels in a herd or drove, together, to pasture.
And hence, ―
-b2- ] سرّب عَلَىَّ الإِبِلَ (tropical:)  He sent
[against me] the camels [app. with armed riders],
one detached number after another: (As, S, A,
K, TA:) and in like manner, الخَيْلَ (tropical:)  [the horsemen]. (S, A, Mgh, TA.) It is said in a trad. of
' Áïsheh, [referring to girls who were her playmates,] كَانَ يُسَرِّبُهُنَّ إِلَىَّ فَيَلْعَبْنَ مَعِى (assumed tropical:)  He used
to send them to me [app. party after party, and
they would play with me]. (TA.) And one says,
سَرَّبْتُ إِلَيْهِ الشَّىْءَ (assumed tropical:)  I sent to him the thing, one
by one; or rather, portion by portion. (L, TA.)
And سَرَّبْتُ إِلَيْهِ الأَشْيَآءَ (tropical:)  I gave him the things,
one after another. (A, TA.) And سَرَّبَهُ He sent
him back in his سرب [i. e. سَرْب], meaning way
[by which he had come]. (Har p. 20.) ―
-b3-  See
also 4.
-A2-  سرّب سَرَبًا He made a subterranean
excavation. (M, A.) ―
-b2-  سرّب الحَافِرُ, (As, TA,)
inf. n. تَسْرِيبٌ, (S, K,) The digger [of a well], in
digging, took [i. e. dug] towards the right and left:
(As, S, * K, * TA:) in some copies of the K, [and
in the S,] right or left: but the former is the
correct explanation. (TA.)
-A3-  سرّب القِرْبَةَ, (S,
M, A,) inf. n. as above, (K,) He poured water
into the قربة [i. e. water-skin, or milk-skin], in
order that the holes made in the sewing might
become filled up (S, M, A, K) by their being
moistened, (S, K,) or by the moistening, and consequent swelling, of the thong [with which it was
sewed]; the قربة being new. (M.)
4
اسرب He made water to flow; as also
↓ سرّب. (M.)
5
تَسَرَّبَ see 1, near the middle of the paragraph. ―
-b2-
[Hence, app.,] تسرّبوا فِيهِ (assumed tropical:)  They followed one
another continuously in it; namely, a road.
(M.) ―
-b3-  See also 7.
-A2-  تسرّب مِنَ المَآءِ He became
full of water. (TA.)
7
إِنْسَرَبَ see 1, near the middle of the paragraph. ―
-b2-
انسرب فِيهِ He entered into it; (S, M, K;) i. e.,
a wild animal, into his سَرَب, (S, M, Msb,) meaning his subterranean habitation, (S, Msb,) or his
place of abode; (M;) and a fox, (S,) into his
burrow; as also ↓ تسرّب. (S, K.)
سَرْبٌ Pasturing مَال, (M, A, TA,) i. e. camels:
(M, TA:) or camels, and مَال [here meaning
cattle in general], that pasture: (S:) or مَال [i. e.
camels or cattle] pasturing during the day without a pastor; an inf. n. used as a subst. in this
sense; and ↓ سَارِبٌ [meaning مَالٌ سَارِبٌ] signifies
the same: (Msb:) or, accord. to IAar, (M,) any
مَاشِيَة [i. e. camels and other cattle]; (M, K;)
thus say IJ and Ibn-Hishám El-Lakhmee: and
accord. to Kz, ↓ سِرْبٌ also, [q. v.,] with kesr,
signifies مَالٌ [syn. with مَاشِيَةٌ]; and IO says the
like: (TA:) pl. of the former سُرُوبٌ, (M, TA,)
and some say أَسْرَابٌ [which is a pl. of pauc.].
(TA.) Hence the saying, اِذْهَبْ فَلَا أَنْدَهُ سَرْبَكَ,
i. e. Go thou away, for I will not drive back thy
[pasturing] camels; (S, Msb; *) they shall go,
(S,) or I will leave them to pasture, (Msb,)
where they will; (S, Msb;) meaning, I have no
need of thee: (S:) in the Time of Ignorance,
they used to divorce by saying thus, (S, M, Msb,)
اِذْهَبِى فَلَا أَنْدَهُ سَرْبَكِ. (S, M, A.) ―
-b2-  [Freytag
also explains it, from the Deewán el-Hudhaleeyeen,
as meaning A sheep-fold.]
-A2-  Also A way, or
road; (AZ, S, M, A, Mgh, Msb, K;) and so
↓ سِرْبٌ with kesr; (M, K;) the latter accord. to
Aboo-' Omar and Th, but' disallowed by Mbr, who
knew only the former in this sense; said by Ibn-Es-Seed to have been pronounced by AZ with
fet-h, and by Aboo-' Omar with kesr: (TA:) and
one's way, or course; (M, K, * TA;) the way by
which one goes. (T, TA. [See also سُرْبَةٌ, and
مَسْرَبٌ.]) One says, خَلِّ سَرْبَهُ Leave thou free,
or unobstructed, his way (T, M, Mgh, Msb, TA)
by which he goes, (T, TA,) and his course; (M,
TA;) and so ↓ سِرْبَهُ, with kesr; (M, TA;) accord.
to Aboo-' Omar: (TA:) or خَلِّ لَهُ سَرْبَهُ leave thou
free, or unobstructed, to him his way. (S, A.)
And أَطْلَقَ الأَسِيرَ وَخَلَّى سَرْبَهُ [He loosed the captive and left free to him his way]. (A.) Hence,
in a trad., مَنْ أَصْبَحَ آمِنًا فِى سَرْبِهِ, meaning
فِى مُتَقَلَّبِهِ and مُتَصَرَّفِهِ [i. e. He who has become
secure in his scope, or room, for free action]: or,
accord. to one reading, the last words are فِى
↓ سِرْبِهِ, meaning, (tropical:)  in respect of his wives, or
women under covert, and his household, or
family; a metaphorical sense, from the سِرْب of
gazelles &c. (A, and so in the Fáïk. [See also
سِرْبٌ.]) Hence also the saying, إِذَا كَان مُخَلَّى
السَّرْبِ, meaning When he is made to be in ample
circumstances; not straitened. (Mgh.) And you
say وَاسِعُ السَّرْبِ, instead of السِّرْبِ; meaning
Whose way that he pursues is ample. (TA.
[But see what follows.])
-A3-  Also The bosom, or
breast; or the mind; syn. صَدْرٌ. (Mbr, M, K.) إِنَّهُ
لَوَاسِعُ السَّرْبِ means Verily he is of ample bosom,
or mind; and judgment; and love: (M, TA:)
or, as some say, ample of bosom, or mind; slow
of anger. (M. [The latter meaning is assigned
in the Msb and TA to وَاسِعُ السِرْبِ: see the next
paragraph.])
سِرْبٌ: see سَارِبٌ. ―
-b2-  [Hence, app.,] A قَطِيع,
(S, M, K,) or جَمَاعَة, (Mgh, Msb,) [i. e. herd,]
of gazelles, (S, M, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) and of
oxen, (M, Mgh, Msb,) [app. meaning wild oxen,]
and of [wild] asses, (M,) and of wild animals [in
general], (S, Msb,) and [a flock or herd] of sheep
or goats, (M,) and [a flock] of the birds called
قَطًا, (S, Msb,) and of birds [in general], (M,)
and [a party, or bevy,] of women, (S, M, Msb,
K,) &c.; (K;) and, as used by El-' Ajjáj, it is of
men also: (Sh, TA:) and a poet of the Jinn, as
they assert, used it metaphorically in speaking of
a سِرْب of the [lizards called] عَظَآء: (M:) it signifies also (assumed tropical:)  a collection of palm-trees; (M, K; in
some copies of the latter of which النَّحْل is erroneously put for النَّخْل; TA;) so says AHn; and
Abu-l-Hasan thinks it to be by way of comparison: and ↓ سُرْبَةٌ is like it [in its meanings]:
(M: [particularly mentioned in the K as used in
the last of the senses above mentioned:]) each of
these words is said to be applied to a قطيع of the
birds called قَطًا, and of gazelles, and of sheep or
goats, on the authority of As; and the latter [or
each] of them is applied to a قطيع of women as
being likened to gazelles: (TA:) the pl. of the
former is أَسْرَابٌ; (Sh, M, Msb, TA;) and of ↓ the
latter, سُرُبٌ, (K, accord. to the TA,) with two
dammehs, (TA,) [in the CK سُرُوبٌ,] or سُرْبٌ,
(so in my MS. copy of the K, [either a contraction of the former pl. or a coll. gen. n. of
which سُرْبَةٌ is the n. un.,]) or both. (TA. [See
also سُرْبَةٌ below, where the pl. is said to be سُرَبٌ.])
―
-b3-  [Hence, as some explain them, two phrases
mentioned below in this paragraph.] ―
-b4-  See also
سَرْبٌ, first sentence.
-A2-  It is also syn. with سَرْبٌ
as meaning A way, or road: and a course: see
سَرْبٌ in two places. ―
-b2-  Also i. q. بَالٌ [app. as syn.
with حَالٌ, i. e. State, or condition]. (S, Msb,
K.) One says, فُلَانٌ وَاسِعُ السِّرْبِ, meaning رَخِىُّ
البَالِ [i. e. Such a one is in an ample, or unstraitened,
state or condition: or the meaning may be, such
a one is easy, or unstraitened, in mind: see what
follows, and see also بَالٌ]: (S, Msb:) or, as some
say, ample of bosom, or mind; slow of anger:
(Msb, TA:) [see also وَاسِعُ السَّرْبِ, in two places
near the end of the next preceding paragraph:]
MF thinks that for بَال we should read مَال,
agreeably with an explanation of a phrase in
what here follows. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Also The قَلْب
[meaning heart, or mind]: (M, K:) and the
نَفْس [meaning self]. (IAar, M, Msb, K.) One
says, هُوَ آمِنٌ فِى سِرْبِهِ He is secure in, or in
respect of, his heart, or mind: or, himself: (M:)
but IDrd disallows this latter explanation; and
says that the meaning is, his family, and his مَال
[or camels, or cattle, or other property], and his,
children; as though the phrase آمن فى سربه
were originally used in relation to the pastor,
and the stallion [camel], and then extended
in its relation to others, metaphorically: (TA:)
or the meaning is [simply], his مَال: or, his
people, or party: (M, TA:) or as expl. above,
voce سَرْبٌ, q. v.: or, accord. to Kz, his way.
(TA.) The pl. is سِرَابٌ. (El-Hejeree, M, TA.)
-A3-  See also مَسْرُبَةٌ.
سَرَب A subterranean excavation: (M, K:) or
a habitation (S, Mgh, Msb, TA) of a wild animal, (S, * Msb,) in, (S, Mgh, Msb,) or beneath,
(TA,) the earth, or ground, (S, Mgh, Msb, TA,)
having no passage through it; also called وَكْرٌ:
(Msb:) such as has a passage through it is
termed نَفَقٌ: (Mgh, Msb:) the burrow, or hole,
(M, K,) of a wild animal, (K,) or of a fox, and
likewise [the den] of a lion, and of a hyena, and
of a wolf; and the place into which a wild
animal enters: (M:) pl. أَسْرَابٌ. (M, A, Msb.)
In the saying in the Kur [xviii. 60], فَاتَّخَذَ
سَبِيلَهُ فِى الْبَحْرِ سَرَبًا [And it (the fish) took its
way into the sea &c.], Fr says that when the fish
was restored to life by the water that came upon
it from the fountain [of life], and fell into the sea,
its way became congealed, and like a سَرَب [or
subterranean excavation, &c.]: Zj says that سربا
may be considered as put in the accus. case in
two ways; either as a second objective complement of the verb, or as an inf. n. [of ↓ سَرِبَ,
q. v.]: and AHát thinks that it here means ذَهَابًا
[going away]: or, accord. to IAth, سَرَبٌ signifies
a secret, or hidden, place of passage: or, as used
by El-Moatarid Edh-Dhafaree, it means [simply]
a road, or way. (TA.) It signifies also A subterranean channel or conduit, by which water
enters a حَائِط [or garden, or walled garden of
palm-trees]. (M, K.) And طَرِيقٌ سَرَبٌ means
A way, or road, in which people follow one
another continuously. (M.) ―
-b2-  Also Flowing
water: (M, K: [see also سَرِبٌ:]) or water flowing
from a مَزَادَة [or leathern water-bag] and the
like: (S:) or water dropping from the punctures
made in the sewing of a water-skin. (A.) ―
-b3-  And
Water that is poured into a قِرْبَة [or skin for
water or milk], (M, K,) when it is new, or into
a مَزَادَة [or leathern water-bag], (M,) in order
that the thong [with which it is sewed] may
become moistened, (M, K,) so as to swell, and fill
up the holes made in the sewing. (M.)
سَرِبٌ Flowing water. (S, * M. [See also سَرَبٌ.])
You say also مَزَادَةٌ سَرِبَةٌ, i. e. [A leathern-water-bag] flowing. (S, K.)
سَرْبَةٌ: see the next paragraph.
-A2-  I. q. خَرْزَةٌ
[A single puncture, or stitch-hole, made in sewing
a skin or the like]. (K. [There expressly said
to be, in this sense, with fet-h; but I think that
we should read سُرْبَةٌ, and خُرْزَةٌ: see, again, the
next paragraph.])
سُرْبَةٌ A short journey; (IAar, M;) or so
↓ سَرْبَةٌ. (K. [But I think that the former is the
right.]) You say, إِنَّكَ لَتُرِيدُ سُرْبَةً Verily thou
desirest a short journey. (IAar, M.) A long
journey is termed سُبْأَةٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And i. q. مَذْهَبٌ
(S, M, A, K) and طَرِيقَةٌ (A, K) [i. e. A way by
which one goes or goes away, a proper meaning
of the former word; and a way, course, mode, or
manner, of acting or conduct or the like, which
is a meaning of both of these words]. One says,
فُلَانٌ بَعِيدُ السُّرْبَةِ, (S, A, TA,) meaning [Such a
one is] one who takes a distant way into the
country, or land: (TA:) or meaning بَعِيدُ المَذْهَبِ
(S, A) and الطَّرِيقَةِ (A) [i. e., who follows a distant, or remote, way in journeying, and a long
way, course, mode, or manner, of acting or conduct or the like. See also سَرْبٌ, and مَسْرَبٌ].
Esh-Shenfarà says,
عَدَوْنَا مِنَ الوَادِى الَّذِى بَيْنَ مِشْعَلٍ
وَبَيْنَ الحَشَا هَيْهَاتَ أَنْسَأْتُ سُرْبَتِى
[We passed from the valley that is between
Mish' al and El-Hashà: distant was it: I made
my way to lead me far off]; meaning, how
distant was the place from which I commenced
my journey! (TA.) And one says also, إِنَّهُ
لَقَرِيبُ السُّرْبَةِ, meaning قَرِيبُ المَذْهَبِ [i. e. Verily
he is one who pursues a near way]; who hastens,

called قَطًا, and of horses, and asses, and gazelles:
(S:) pl. سُرَبٌ, like غُرَفٌ pl. of غُرْفَةٌ. (Msb.) See
also سِرْبٌ, in two places; in the latter of which
the pl. is said to be سُرُبٌ and سُرْبٌ. ―

twenty to thirty, (M, K,) or from ten to twenty.

or the semblance of water, (S, M, A, K,) of running water, (M,) at midday, (S, M, A, K,)
cleaving to the ground, (M,) and [in appearance]
lowering everything so that it becomes [as though
it were] cleaving to the ground, having no شَخْص;
(TA;) whereas the آل is that which is in the
ضُحَى [or early part of the day when the sun is
yet low], raising figures seen from a distance, and
making them to quiver: (M:) [several other
distinctions between the سراب and the آل, mentioned here in the TA, see voce آلٌ:] سَرَابٌ has
no pl. (S and K voce نَهَارٌ.) One says أَخْدَعُ
مِنْ سَرَابٍ [More deceitful than a middaymirage]. (A.)
-A2-  سَرَابِ, like قَطَامِ, (A, K, TA,)
i. e. indecl., with kesr for its termination, as also
سَرَابُ, imperfectly decl., (TA,) determinate, (K,
TA,) as a proper name, not having the article ال
prefixed to it, (TA,) is the name of The she-camel of El-Basoos (البَسُوس), (K,) or the she-camel El-Basoos, (A, TA,) for El-Basoos was
her surname: (TA:) whence the saying أَشْأَمُ مِنْ
سَرَابِ [More inauspicious than Sarábi]: (A, K,
TA:) a celebrated prov.: for she was the cause of
a famous war. (TA.)
سَرُوبٌ [Wont to go away at random]: see 1,
near the beginning of the paragraph.
سَرِيبَةٌ A sheep, or goat, (شَاةٌ,) which one drives
back, or brings back, from the water, when the
sheep, or goats, are satisfied with drinking, and
which they follow. (M, TA. [See also شَرِيبَةٌ.])
سَارِبٌ Going forth: and going away; as also
↓ سِرْبٌ; the latter expl. by IAar as syn. with
ذَاهِبٌ and مَاضٍ: (M: [in one place in the TA
the latter is erroneously written سيرب:]) or going
away at random into the country, or in the land.
(S, K.) See also سَرْبٌ, first sentence. You say
مَالٌ سَارِبٌ, (A,) and فَحْلٌ سَارِبٌ, (TA,) i. e.
[Camels, or cattle, and a stallion-camel,] repairing
to the place of pasture: (A, TA:) and ظَيْبَةٌ سَارِبٌ
(M) or سَارِبَةٌ (TA) [a she-gazelle] going away in
her place of pasture. (M, TA.) A poet says,
(S, M,) namely, El-Akhnas Ibn-Shiháb ElTeghlibee, (TA,)
وَكُلُّ أُنَاسٍ قَارَبُوا قَيْدَ فَحْلِهِمْ
وَنَحْنُ خَلَعْنَا قَيْدَهُ فَهُوَ سَارِبُ
[And all other men have contracted the shackles
of their stallion-camel; but we have pulled off his
shackles, and he is going away whithersoever he
will in his place of pasture]: (S, M, TA: but in
the last, حَلَلْنَا is put in the place of خَلَعْنَا: [in
the Ham (p. 347) it begins thus: أَرَى كُلَّ قَوْمٍ:])
this, says As, is a prov.; meaning [other] men
have abode in one place, not daring to remove to
another, and have contracted the shackles of their
stallion, that is, confined him, that he may not
advance, and be followed by their [other] camels;
fearing a hostile attack upon them: but we are
people of might, wandering about the land, and
going whithersoever we will; and we have pulled
off the shackles of our stallion, that he may go
whither he will; and whithersoever he hastes
away to herbage produced by the rain, thither we
follow him: (IB, TA:) or it may be that by the
