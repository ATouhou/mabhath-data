سرى1
سَرَى, (S, M, K,) or سَرَى اللَّيْلَ (Msb) and
بِاللَّيْلِ, (Mgh, Msb,) aor. يَسْرِى, (K,) inf. n.
سُرًى (S, M, Mgh, K) and مَسْرًى (S, K) and
سَرْيَةٌ and سُرْيَةٌ (M, K) and سِرَايَةٌ; (S, * and TA
as from the K, but not in the CK nor in my MS.
copy of the K;) the first of a form rare among
inf. ns., because it is one of the forms of pls., as
is shown by the fact that some of the Arabs make
it and هُدًى fem., namely, Benoo-Asad, supposing them to be pls. of سُرْيَةٌ and هُدْيَةٌ, (S,) and
Lh knew not سُرًى but as a fem. noun; (M;) or
the inf. n. is سَرْىٌ, and سُرْيَةٌ and سَرْيَةٌ are more
special [in meaning, as will be shown below, voce
سَرْيَةٌ], and سُرًى is pl. of سُرْيَةٌ; (Msb;) or سَرْيَةٌ
is an inf. n. un., and سُرْيَةٌ is a simple subst., and
so is سُرًى, (S, TA,) and so is سِرَايَةٌ (Msb, TA)
also, as some say; (TA;) He journeyed, or
travelled, by night, or in the night, (S, M, Mgh,
Msb, K,) in a general sense; (M, K;) accord. to
AZ, in the first part part of the night, and in the
middle thereof, and in the last part thereof;
(Msb, TA;) and ↓ اسرى signifies the same (S,
M, Mgh, Msb, K) in the dial. of El-Hijáz, (S,
Msb,) inf. n. إِسْرَآءٌ; (M;) as also ↓ استرى; (M,
K;) and perhaps ↓ تسرّى likewise. (Mgh.) [See
also سُرًى and سَرْيَةٌ below.] It is said in a prov.,
قُنْفُذٍ ↓ ذَهَبُوا إِسْرَآءَ [They went away in the manner
of a hedge-hog's night-travelling; meaning they
went away by night]; because the قنفذ goes all
the night, not sleeping. (M.) ―
-b2-  [Hence, as
denoting unseen progress,] it is said also of the
root of a tree, meaning It crept along beneath
the ground; (Az, M, K;) aor. as above, (M,)
inf. n. سَرْىٌ. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And it is said of ideal
things, as being likened to corporeal things;
tropically, and by extension of the signification;
(Msb, TA;) or metaphorically; [as, for instance,]
of calamities, and wars, and anxieties: (M, TA:)
and the predominant inf. ns. [in these cases] are
سِرَايَةٌ and سَرَيَانٌ. (TA.) One says, سَرَى عِرْقُ
السُّوْءِ فِى الإِنْسَانِ (tropical:)  [The root, or strain, of evil
crept in the man]. (Es-Sarakustee, Msb, TA.)
And سَرَى فِيهِ السَّمُّ (tropical:)  [The poison crept in him, or
pervaded him]; and similarly one says of wine;
and of the like of these two things. (El-Fárábee,
Msb, TA. [See also دَبَّ.]) And the lawyers say,
سَرَى الجُرْحُ إِلَى النَّفْسِ (tropical:)  [The wound extended to
the soul], meaning that the pain of the wound
continued until death ensued in consequence
thereof: (Mgh, * Msb, TA:) and قُطِعَ كَفُّهُ فَسَرَى
إِلَى سَاعِدِهِ (tropical:)  [His hand was cut off, and it extended to his upper arm], meaning that the effect
of the wound passed by transmission: and سَرَى
التَّحْرِيمُ, and العِتْقُ, (tropical:)  The prohibition, and the
emancipation, [extended, or] passed by transmission: phrases current among the lawyers, but not
mentioned in books of repute, though agreeable
with others here preceding and following. (Msb,
TA.) One says also, سَرَى عَلَيْهِ الهَمُّ (tropical:)  Anxiety
came to him [or upon him] by night: and سَرَى
هَمُّهُ (tropical:)  His anxiety went away. (Msb, TA.) And
similar to these is the phrase in the Kur [lxxxix.
3], وَاللَّيْلِ إِذَا يَسْرِ (tropical:)  And by the night when it
goes away: (Msb, TA:) or, as some say, when
one journeys in it; like as one says لَيْلٌ نَائِمٌ
meaning “ night in which one sleeps: ” the [final]
ى [of the verb] is elided because it terminates a
verse. (TA.) ―
-b4-  It is made trans. by means of
ب: (Msb:) one says, سَرَى بِهِ [He made him to
journey, or travel, or he transported him, by
night, or in the night; or it may be rendered he
journeyed, or travelled, with him, by night, or in
the night]; (M, Msb, K;) and in like manner,
[and more commonly,] بِهِ ↓ أَسْرَى; (S, M, Msb,
K;) and ↓ أَسْرَاهُ; (S, M, K;) like as one says,
أَخَذَ بِالخِطَامِ as well as اخذ الخِطَامَ. (S.) As to
the saying in the Kur [xvii. 1], سُبْحَانَ الَّذِى
بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلًا ↓ أَسْرَى [Extolled be the glory of Him
who transported his servant by night!], it is an
instance of corroboration, (S, K, * TA,) like the
saying, سِرْتُ أَمْسِ نَهَارًا and البَارِحَةَ لَيْلًا: (S, TA:)
or the meaning is [simply] سَيَّرَهُ: (K, TA:) accord. to 'Alam-ed-Deen Es-Sakháwee, لَيْلًا is
added, although الإِسْرَآء is not otherwise than by
night, because the space over which he was
transported is not to be traversed in less than
forty days, but was traversed by him in one
night; as though the meaning [intended] were,
فِى لَيْلٍ وَاحِدٍ; and it denotes wonder: لَيْلًا is here
used instead of لَيْلَةً because when they say سَرَى
لَيْلَةً the meaning generally is he occupied the
whole of the night in journeying: Er-Rághib
holds the verb in this instance to be from سَرَاةٌ
signifying “ a wide tract of land,” to belong to
art. سرو, and to be like أَجْبَلَ and أَتْهَمَ; the meaning being, who transported his servant over a
wide tract of land: but this is strange. (TA.)
-A2-
سَرَى مَتَاعَهُ, (M, K,) aor. يَسْرِى, (M, TA,) inf. n.
سَرْىٌ, (TA,) He threw his goods, or utensils and
furniture, upon the back of his beast. (M, K.)
―
-b2-  And سَرَى عَنِّى الثَّوْبَ, inf. n. سَرْىٌ, He removed from over me the garment: but و is more
approved [as the final radical: see 1 in art, سرو].
(M, TA.) You say, سَرَيْتُ الثَّوْبَ and ↓ سَرَّيْتُهُ I
pulled off the garment: and عَنْهُ ↓ سُرِّىَ It was
removed from over him, and removed from its
place: the teshdeed denotes intensiveness. (TA.)
2
سرّى, (K,) or سرّى سَرِيَّةً, (TA,) inf. n.
تَسْرِيَةٌ, He (the leader of an army, TA) detached a
سَرِيَّة [q. v.] (K, TA) to the enemy by night. (TA.) ―
-b2-
سرّى العَرَقَ عَنْ بَدَنِهِ, inf. n. as above, He exuded
the sweat from his body. (TA.) ―

سُرًى, [said by some to be an inf. n., by some
to be a simple subst., and by some to be pl. of
سُرْيَةٌ, or supposed to be so, and therefore made
fem., as mentioned in the first sentence of this
art.,] meaning A journeying, or travelling, by
night, or in the night, in a general sense, is masc.
and fem., (M, K,) by some of the Arabs made
fem., (S,) and not known to Lh but as a fem.
noun. (M.) It is said in a prov.,
عِنْدَ الصَّبَاحِ يَحْمَدُ القَوْمُ السُّرَى
[At daybreak, the party commend night-journeying]: applied to the man who endures difficulty,
or distress, or fatigue, hoping for rest, or ease:
(Meyd:) and in inciting to labour for the accomplishment of an affair with patience, and to dispose
and subject the mind, until one commends the result thereof. (Har p. 555, q. v.)
سَرَاةٌ: see art. سرو.
سَرْيَةٌ and ↓ سُرْيَةٌ are inf. ns. of سَرَى: (M, K:)
or have a more special signification than the
inf. n. of that verb, which is سَرْىٌ: one says,
سَرَيْنَا سَرْيَةً مِنَ اللَّيْلِ and ↓ سُرْيَةً [We journeyed
by night a journey of the night]: and the pl. of
↓ سُرْيَةٌ is [said to be] سُرًى: (Msb:) or one says,
سَرَيْنَا سَرْيَةً وَاحِدَةً [We journeyed by night a
single night-journey]: and the subst. [signifying
a journeying, or travelling, by night, or in the
night,] is ↓ سُرْيَةٌ, and سُرًى. (S, TA.)
سُرْيَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in
four places.
سِرْيَةٌ meaning An arrow-head, (As, M, TA,)
such as is small, short, round and smooth, having
no breadth, (M, TA,) is a dial. var. of سِرْوَةٌ
[q. v.], (As, TA,) or formed from the latter word
by the substitution of ى for و because of the
kesreh: (M, TA:) accord. to the K, ↓ سَرِيَّةٌ
signifies a small round arrow-head; but this is a
mistake; the correct word being سِرْيَةٌ, with kesr,
and without teshdeed to the ى. (TA.)
-A2-  It is
also a dial. var. of سِرْوَةٌ signifying The locust in
its first state, when it is a larva. (S in art. سرو.)
سَرَآءٌ A certain tree, (AHn, S, M, K,) from
which bows are made, (AHn, S, M,) the wood
whereof is of the best of woods, and which is of
the trees of the mountains: (AHn, M:) ElGhanawee El-Aarábee says, the نَبْع and شَوْحَط
[q. v.] and سَرَآء are one: (TA in art. شحط:) [it
is also mentioned in the TA in art. سرأ:] n. un.
سَرَآءَةٌ. (M, K.)
سَرِىٌّ i. q. نَهْرٌ [A river, &c.]: (Th, M:) or a
rivulet, or streamlet: (S, M, Msb:) or a rivulet
running to palm-trees: (M, K:) pl. [of pauc.]

M, Msb, K:) أَسْرِيَآءُ as its pl. has not been heard.
(S.) Thus it has been expl. as occurring in the
Kur xix. 24. (M, TA.)
-A2-  See also art. سرو.
سَرِيَّةٌ A portion of an army: (S, Msb:) of the
measure فَعِيلَةٌ in the sense of the measure فَاعِلَةٌ;
because marching by night, privily; (Mgh,
Msb;) thus originally, and afterwards applied
also to such as march by day: (Ham p. 45:) or
it may be from الاِسْتِرَآءُ “ the act of choosing, or
selecting; ” because a company chosen from the
army: (Mgh: [but if so, belonging to art. سرو:])
from five persons to three hundred: (M, K:) or
four hundred: (K:) or, of horsemen, about four
hundred: (M:) or the best thereof, (S,) or the
utmost, (Nh,) consists of four hundred: (S,
Nh:) or, accord. to the “ Fet-h el-Bári,” from
a hundred to five hundred: (TA:) or nine, and
more than this; three, and four, and the like

as having previously travelled in the night:] or,
accord. to Lh, a rain that comes in the night:

سَوَارٍ, being indeterminate]. (K, TA.) ―
