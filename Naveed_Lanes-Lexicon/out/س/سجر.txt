filled the wells]. (A.) And سُجِرَتِ الثِّمَادُ The
ثماد [see its sing. ثَمَدٌ] became filled by the rain.
(S.) In the Kur [lxxxi. 6], وَ إِذَا الْبِحَارُ سُجِرَتْ,
some read thus; and others, ↓ سُجِّرَتْ; (Zj;) and
Th explains it, and so Zj the former reading, as
signifying, And when the seas shall be filled:
but ISd says that there is no way of understanding this unless it mean filled with fire: or it
means and when the seas shall overflow: or shall
meet together and become one sea: (TA:) or
↓ سُجِّرَتْ signifies shall flow forth, one into another, and thus become one sea, (Zj, Bd,) and so be
filled: (Bd:) and there are other explanations of
the above-mentioned words of the Kur, which
see below. ―
-b2-  سَجَرَ المَآءَ فِى حَلْقِهِ He poured the

(Bd in lxxxi. 6;) or the latter has an intensive
signification; (Mgh;) He heated the oven; (S,
A, K;) kindled fire in it: (Msb:) or filled it
with firewood, to heat it: (Mgh Bd:) or he
heated it fully with fuel. (TA.) The words of
the Kur quoted above, و اذا البحار سُجِرَتْ, are said
to signify And when the seas shall be set on fire:
(El-Hasan El-Basree:) or shall become without
water, (Katádeh,) or shall be dried up, by the kindling of fire therein: (B:) or shall be kindled, and
become fire: (Jel:) or shall be mixed together, and
dry up, and become fire; (El-Ubbee;) an explanation founded upon the license to employ a homonym
in its several significations together: (MF:) or
by “ sea ” is meant hell. (Kaab.) You say also,
