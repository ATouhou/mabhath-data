سنت2
سنّت القِدْرَ, inf. n. تَسْنِيتٌ, He put سَنُّوت,
(S, K,) meaning كَمُّون [i. e. cumin, or cuminseed], (S,) into the cooking-pot. (S, K.)
3
سانتوا الأَرْضَ They sought after the herbage
of the land, doing so diligently, or with labour or
perseverance, or time after time. (M, K.)
4
اسنتوا They experienced drought, or barrenness: (S, M, A, K:) derived from سَنَةٌ; the و
being changed into ت, [for سَنَةٌ is originally
سَنْوَةٌ, or, accord. to one dial. سَنْهَةٌ,] to distinguish
between this verb and أَسْنَى as signifying “ he
remained in a place a year: ” or, as Fr says, they
imagined the ه [meaning ة, in سَنَةٌ,] to be a
radical letter, finding it to be the third letter, and
therefore changed it into ت: (S:) accord. to Sb,
the ت [in أَسْنَتَ] is substituted for the ى [in
أَسْنَى]; and there is no instance of the like except
ثِنْتَانِ [in which the ت is substituted for the final
radical, ى], (M in the present art.,) and in words
of the measure اِفْتَعَلَ [as اِتَّسَرَ for اِيتَسَرَ]. (M in
art. ثنى.)

تَسَنَّتَهَا [He married her, or took her as his
wife, he being an ignoble, or a low-born, but rich,
man, and she being a noble, or high-born, but
poor, woman; or] he, an ignoble, or a low-born,
man, married her, a noble, or high-born woman,
because of the paucity of her property and the
abundance of his property. (S) And تسنّت
كَرِيمَةَ آلِ فُلَانٍ He married the noble or highborn, woman of the family of such a one in the
