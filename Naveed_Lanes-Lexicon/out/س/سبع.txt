The Arabs also said, سَبَّعَ اللّٰهُ لَكَ أَجْرَهَا May
God multiply to thee the reward, or recompense,
for it; meaning, for this good act: (Aboo-Sa'eed:) [for] تَسْبِيعٌ is used by them to signify

like manner, دراهمه ↓ سَبْعَنَ, meaning the same,

language, and in frequency of coïtus, and in
speaking plainly of such subjects as should only

reviling, vilifying, or vituperating; (K, TA;)
when each of two men assails the other with foul

[which may be rendered He gave him as food
the animal of prey, or he gave him as food to the
animal of prey; but it seems from what here

“ Mufradát,” [he gave him as food] the flesh of
the سَبُع. (TA.)
-A4-  He gave him, or delivered
him, (namely, his son,) to the ظُؤُورَة [which

Q. Q. 1
سَبْعَنَ: see 2. last sentence but one.
سَبْعٌ fem. of سَبْعَةٌ, q. v.
-A2-  See also سَبُعٌ in two
places.
-A3-  السَّبْعُ The place to which mankind
shall be congregated (K, TA) on the day of
resurrection. (TA.) Hence the trad., (K, TA,)
which relates that while a pastor was among his
sheep, or goats, the wolf rushed upon him, and
took from them a sheep, or goat, and the pastor
pursued him until he rescued it from him; whereupon the wolf looked aside towards him, and
said to him, (TA,) مَنْ لَهَا يَوْمَ السَّبْعِ, meaning
Who will be for it [namely, the sheep, or goat, as
aider, or defender,] on the day of resurrection?
(K, TA:) thus expl. by I Aar, and mentioned by
Sgh and the author of the L: (TA:) but to this
is contradictory, or repugnant, يَعْكُرُ, [in the CK
erroneously written يَعْكَرُ,]) the saying of the
wolf, (K, TA,) after the words mentioned above,
(TA,) “ the day when it shall have no pastor but
me; ” for the wolf will not be a pastor on the day
of resurrection: or the meaning is, who shall be
for it on the occasion of trials, when it shall be
left to itself, without pastor, a spoil to the
animals of prey: the animal of prey being thus
made to be a pastor to it: (K, TA:) this is in the
way of a trope: and accord. to this explanation,
it may be [↓ يَوْمَ السَّبُعِ] with damm to the ب:
(TA:) or يَوْمُ السَّبْعِ was a festival of their's in the
Time of Ignorance, on which they were diverted
from everything by their sport: (AO, K, TA:)
and accord. to one relation [of the trad.] it is
with damm to the ب. (L, K.)
سُبْعٌ (S, Msb, K) and ↓ سُبُعٌ, (Mgh, Msb,)
of which the former is a contraction, (Msb,) A
seventh part; one of seven parts; (S, Mgh, Msb,
K;) as also ↓ سَبِيعٌ; (S, Msb, K;) the last not
heard by Sh on any authority beside that of AZ:
(TA:) pl. of the first (Msb) and second (Mgh,
Msb) أَسْبَاعٌ. (Mgh, Msb, TA.) Hence, أَسْبَاعٌ
القُرْآنِ [The seven sections, or volumes, of the
Kur-an,] in which one reads: said to be postclassical. (Mgh.)
-A2-  See also أُسْبُوعٌ, in three
places.
سِبْعٌ A certain ظِمْء of the أَظْمَآء of camels;
(T, S, K;) i. e. their coming to the water on the
seventh day [counting the day of the next preceding watering as the first]; (K;) or [in other
words, which have virtually the same meaning,]
their remaining in their places of pasturing five
complete days, and coming to the water on the
sixth day, not reckoning the day of the [next
preceding] return from the water. (Az, TA.)
You say, وَرَدَتْ إِبْلُهُ سِبْعًا His camels came to
the water &c. (S, K.) ―
-b2-  Also The seventh young
one, or offspring. (A in art. ثلث.)
سَبَعٌ: see what next follows.
سَبُعٌ (S, Sgh, Msb, K) and ↓ سَبْعٌ, (Sgh, Msb,
K,) a dial. var., (Sgh, Msb,) and the form in
common use with the vulgar, (Msb,) adopted
also by several readers of the Kur in v. 4, (Msb,
TA,) and often occurring in the poems of the
Arabs, (TA,) and ↓ سَبَعٌ, (Sgh, K,) a form
adopted by two readers of the Kur in the place
above mentioned, and perhaps a dial. var., (Sgh,
TA,) The animal of prey; the rapacious animal;
(K;) [whether beast or bird; being sometimes
applied to the latter, as, for instance, in the K,
voce مِخْلَبٌ; but generally to the former:] or
whatsoever has a fang, or canine tooth, with
which it makes hostile attacks, and seizes its
prey; (Msb;) such as the lion, [to which it is
particularly applied by most of the Arabs in the
present day,] and also (TA) such as the wolf and
the lynx and the leopard, (Msb, TA,) and the
like of these, that has a fang, and attacks men
and beasts and makes them its prey: (TA:) the
fox, however, is not thus called, though having
a fang, (Msb, TA,) because he does not attack
with it nor take prey, (Msb,) or because he does
not attack small beasts, nor seize with his fang
any animal; (TA;) and in like manner the hyena
(Msb, TA) is not reckoned among the hostile
animals thus called, wherefore the Sunneh allows
that its flesh may be eaten, and requires that a
compensation be made for it [by the sacrifice of a
ram] if it be smitten [and killed] in the sacred
territory or by a person in the state of ihrám: but
as to the jackal, it is a noxious سبع, and its flesh
is unlawful, because it is of the same kind as
wolves, except that it is smaller in size and
weaker in body: thus says Az: but some others
say that the سبع is any hostile beast having a
مِخْلَب [or tearing claw]: and it is said in the
Mufradát to be thus called because of the perfectness of its strength; for السَّبْعُ [seven] is one of the
perfect numbers: (TA:) the pl. is سِبَاعٌ, (Sb, S,
Msb, K,) i. e., of سَبُعٌ, which has no other pl.;
(Sb, Msb;) أَسْبُعٌ is also a pl., (Sgh, Msb, K,)
but this is pl. of pauc. of ↓ سَبْعٌ, (Sgh, Msb,)
which, not being a contraction [of سَبُعٌ, but a
dial. var. thereof], has also for its pls. [of mult.]
سُبُوعٌ and سُبُوعَةٌ, like صُقُورٌ and صُقُورَةٌ, pls. of
صَقْرٌ. (TA.) See also سَبْعٌ: [and see سَبُعَةٌ.]
You say of him who is very injurious, or mischievous, مَا هُوَ إِلَّا سَبُعٌ مِنَ السِّبَاعِ (tropical:)  [He is none
other than one of the animals of prey]. (TA.) ―
-b2-
السَّبُعُ is also the name of (assumed tropical:)  The constellation
[Lupus] behind [i. e. on the east of] Centaurus,
containing nineteen stars in the figure. (Kzw.)
سُبُعٌ: see سُبْعٌ.
سَبْعَةٌ, (S, K,) sometimes pronounced ↓ سَبَعَةٌ
but some disallow this latter, and say that it is
pl. of سَابِعٌ, (K,) [Seven;] a well-known number;
and called one of the perfect numbers: (TA:)
fem. سَبْعٌ. (S, K.) You say, سَبْعَةُ رِجَالٍ [Seven
men]: and سَبْعُ نِسْوَةٍ [seven women]. (S, K.) ―
-b2-
أَخَذَهُ أَخْذَ سَبْعَةٍ: see سَبُعَةٌ. ―
-b3-  وَزْنَ سَبْعَةٍ means
Of the weight of seven مَثَاقِيل: (S, K:) one says,
أَخَذْتُ مِنْهُ مِائَةَ دِرْهَمٍ وَزْنَ سَبْعَةٍ, meaning [I
took, or received, from him a hundred dirhems]
every ten whereof were of the weight of seven
mithkáls. (TA.) [But see دِرْهَمٌ.] ―
-b4-  إِحْدَى مِنْ
سبْعٍ [lit. One of seven;] means (assumed tropical:)  a great,
momentous, or difficult, thing, or affair: (Sh,
K: *) an affair difficult to decide: perhaps as
being likened to one of the seven nights in which
God sent the punishment upon [the tribe of]
'Ád: or, as some say, the seven years [of famine
in the days] of Joseph. (Sh, TA.) ―
-b5-  السَّبْعُ
المَثَانِى The Fátihah; [or first chapter of the
Kur-án;] because it consists of seven verses: or
the long chapters from البَقَرَة to الأَعْراف [a mistake for الأَنْفَال]; as in the Mufradát: or, as in
the L, to التَّوْبَة, reckoning التوبة and الانفال as
one chapter, for which reason they are not
separated by the بَسْمَلَة. (TA.) [See also مَثْنًى.]
―
-b6-  El-Farezdak says,
وَكَيْفَ أَخَافُ النَّاسَ وَاللّٰهُ قَابِضٌ
عَلَى النَّاسِ وَالسَّبْعَيْنِ فِى رَاحَةِ اليَدِ
meaning [And how should I fear men when God
is comprehending mankind and] the seven heavens
and seven earths [in the palm of the hand?].
(K.) ―
-b7-  See also أُسْبُوعٌ; last sentence. ―
-b8-  [سَبْعَةٌ
is also used in a vague manner, as meaning
Seven or more; or several; or many; as Bd says,
in ix. 81, and as is indicated, though not plainly
declared, in the TA. See 2: and see also سَبْعُونَ.
―
-b9-  Respecting a peculiar pronunciation of the people
of El-Hijáz, and a case in which سَبْعَة is imperfectly decl., see ثَلَاثَةٌ. See also سِتَّةٌ.] ―
-b10-  سَبْعَةَ
عَشَرَ [indecl. in every case, meaning Seventeen,]
is pronounced by some of the Arabs سَبْعَةَ عْشَرَ:
and [the fem.] سَبْعَ عَشْرَةَ, thus in the dial. of El-
Hijáz [and of most of the Arabs], is pronounced
سَبْعَ عَشِرَةَ in the dial. of Nejd. (S in art. عشر.)
-A2-  See also سَبُعَةٌ, in two places.
سَبَعَةٌ: see سَبْعَةٌ.
سَبُعَةٌ and ↓ سَبْعَةٌ, the latter a contraction of the
former, The lioness. (ISk, S, Msb, K.) Hence
the saying, ↓ أَخَذَهُ أَخَذَ سَبْعَةٍ, (ISk, S, K,) or
السَّبْعَةِ, (Msb,) He seized him with the seizing of
a lioness, (ISk, S, K,) or of the lioness, (Msb,)
which is more impetuous (أَنْزَقُ) than the lion,
(ISk, S,) or more bold than the lion: (Msb:) or
the saying is, أَخَذَهُ أَخْذَ سَبْعَةَ (S, K) he seized
him with the seizing of Seb'ah, who was a certain
strong man, (Ibn-El-Kelbee, S,) or a certain
insolent and audacious rebel, (Ibn-El-Kelbee,
Lth, K,) of the Arabs, (TA,) whom one of the
kings of El-Yemen seized, and, after having cut
off his hands and feet, or arms and legs, crucified;
[so that the meaning is, he punished him with
the punishment of Seb'ah;] and hence it was
said, لَأُعَذِّبَنَّكَ عَذَابَ سَبْعَةَ [I will assuredly punish
thee with the punishment of Seb'ah]; (El-Kelbee,
Lth, K; *) and لَأَعْمَلَنَّ بِكَ عَمَلَ سَبْعَةَ I will
assuredly do with thee as was done with Seb'ah:
(O:) or the man's name was سَبُعٌ, and it was
contracted, and made fem. by way of contempt:
or the meaning of the first saying is, he seized
him with the seizing of seven men: (K:) and in
like manner the last saying is expl. by some [who
say سَبْعَةٍ instead of سَبْعَةَ]. (TA.) The dim. is
↓ سُبَيْعَةٌ. (Msb.) [See also سَبُعٌ.]
[
سَبُعِىٌّ Of, or relating to, an animal of prey.]
سَبْعُونَ [Seventy;] a well-known number; (K;)
the round number that is between سِتُّونَ and
ثَمَانُونَ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  The Arabs also use it as meaning [Seventy or more; or] many. (TA.) Thus
it is used in the Kur [ix. 81], where it is said,
إِنْ تَسْتَغْفِرْ لَهُمْ سَبْعِينَ مَرَّةً فَلَنْ يَغْفِرَ اللّٰهُ لَهُمْ, meaning If thou beg forgiveness for them many times,
even then God will not forgive them; not that God
would forgive them if forgiveness were begged
more than seventy times: (Bd, * TA:) and سَبْعَةٌ
and سَبْعُمِائَةٍ and the like are used in the same
manner. (Bd.) ―
-b3-  [Also Seventieth.]
[
سُبَاعَ as meaning Seven and seven, or seven and
seven together, or seven at a time and seven at a
time, seems not to have been used; for] A'Obeyd
says that more than أُحَادَ and ثُنَآءَ and ثُلَاثَ and
رُبَاعَ has not been heard, excepting عُشَارَ. (TA in
art. عشر.)

cubits, or seven spans, in length. (TA.) ―

great and tall camel; (En-Nadr, K;) [as though

سُبَاعِىُّ البَدَنِ, (S, K,) applied to a man, has the
like meaning; (K;) complete, or full-grown, in
body; (S, TA;) [or seven spans in height; for]
when a boy has attained seven spans, he is a man.
(S, voce خُمَاسِىٌّ, q. v.)
سَابِعٌ [act. part. n. of 1: generally meaning
Seventh]: pl. سَبَعَةٌ. (K.) You say, كُنْتُ سَابِعَهُمْ
[I was the seventh of them]. (S, K.) And هٰذَا
هٰذَا ↓ سَبِيعُ, meaning سَابِعُهُ [This is the seventh
of this: not the seventh part; though the former
has also this latter meaning]. (TA.) And هُوَ
سَابِعُ سَبْعَةٍ [He is the seventh of seven]. (TA.)
And هُوَ سَابِعٌ سِتَّةً [He is making six to become
seven]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  إِبِلٌ سَوَابِعُ [pl. of سَابِعَةٌ] Camels
coming to the water on the seventh day [counting
the day of the next preceding watering as the

-b3-  [سَابِعَ عَشَرَ and
سَابِعَةَ عَشْرَةَ, the former masc. and the latter fem.,
meaning Seventeenth, are subject to the same
rules as ثَالِثَ عَشَرَ and its fem., expl. in art.
ثلث, q. v.]
أُسْبُوعٌ A certain number of days; (S, * Msb,
K; *) i. e. seven days; a week; (Msb;) also

what follows:] pl. of the first أَسَابِيعُ. (Msb, TA.)
One says, ↓ أَقَمْتُ عِنْدَهُ سُبْعَيْنِ [in the sense of
أُسْبُوعَيْنِ, which is more common,] i. e. I remained at his abode two weeks. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also
The seventh day; and so ↓ سُبُوعٌ; as in a trad.,
where it is said, إِذَا كَانَ يَوْمَ سُبُوعِهِ, meaning
When his seventh day after the celebration of his
marriage is come. (TA.) [↓ يَوْمُ السُّبُوعِ is used
in this sense in the present day: and also as
meaning The seventh day after childbirth; in
which sense it is generally to be understood when
used unrestrictedly; as this day is celebrated with
more rejoicing than the former: also as meaning
the seventh day after the return from pilgrimage.] ―
-b3-
And Seven circuitings [round the House of God,
meaning the Kaabeh]: (Lth, Mgh, Msb:) pl.
أَسَابِيعُ (S, Mgh, Msb) and أُسْبُوعَاتٌ. (Lth, Mgh,
Msb.) You say, طَافَ بِالبَيْتِ أُسْبُوعًا, (S, Mgh, *
K,) and ↓ سُبُوعًا, (Lth, IDrd, K,) but A boo Sa'eed
says, I know not any one who has said this
except IDrd, and the former is the word commonly known, (TA,) and ↓ سَبْعًا, (K,) and ↓ سُبْعًا,
(TA,) He circuited round the House [of God]
seven times, (S, TA,) or seven circuitings; (Mgh;)
and ثَلَاثَةَ أَسَابِيعَ [thrice seven times, or thrice
seven circuitings]. (S.)
مُسْبَعٌ Given, or delivered, to the ظُؤُورَة [which
means both nurse and nurses]: (Skr, S, TA:)
this is the primary signification: (Skr:) or whose
mother dies, and who is therefore suckled by
another; (K; in which the next following signification may be regarded as implied, TA;) left
to himself; or left without work, or occupation;
applied to a slave; syn. مُهْمَلٌ: (Skr, S:) or مُتْرَفٌ,

مُهْمَلٌ, for he who is مُهْمَل is usually مُتْرَف: (TA:)
or one who is left to himself with the سِبَاع [or
animals of prey] so that he becomes like one of
them in mischievousness, or noxiousness, or evilness: (AO, K:) or who is left to himself and not
