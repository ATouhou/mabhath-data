سَتْهٌ and سُتْهٌ: see اِسْتٌ, below.
سِتْهٌ: see اِسْتٌ, below, in two places.
سَتَهٌ: see اِسْتٌ, below, in two places.
-A2-  Also
Largeness of the اِسْت. (S, K.)
سَتِهٌ; and its fem., with ة: see أَسْتَهُ, in two
places: and see what next follows.
سَتَهِىٌّ Of, or relating to, the اِسْت; and in the
same sense, if you will, you may say ↓ اِسْتِىٌّ;
and ↓ سَتِهٌ also, with kesr to the ت, like as they
said حَرِحٌ. (S.)
سُتْهُمٌ: see أَسْتَهُ, in three places.
سُتَيْهَةٌ dim. of اِسْتٌ, from the original of the
latter, i. e. سَتَهٌ. (TA.)
سُتَاهِىٌّ: see أَسْتَهُ, in two places.
سُتَيْهِىٌّ: see what next follows.
سَيْتَهِىٌّ, thus correctly, in the handwriting of
Sgh, on the authority of Fr; in the K, ↓ سُتَيْهِىٌّ;
(TA;) One who always walks, or goes, at the
rear of a people, or party, (IB, K, TA,) remaining behind them, and looking to their goods.
(IB, TA.)
اِسْتٌ (S, Mgh, K, written with the conjunctive
hemzeh, Msb in art. است) and ↓ سَتَهٌ (S Mgh, K)
and ↓ سَتْهٌ (K) and ↓ سِتْهٌ (CK [but not in my MS.
copy of the K nor in the TA, and of doubtful authority, as will be seen from what follows,]) signify the
same, (S, * Mgh, * K,) i. e. The podex, buttock or buttocks, posteriors, rump, or croup; and sometimes
the anus; (S;) ↓ سَتَهٌ being the original form, as
is shown by the pl., (S, Mgh,) which is أَسْتَاهٌ;
(S, Mgh, K;) like جَمَلٌ and أَجْمَالٌ: it may not
be [↓ سِتْهٌ and ↓ سُتْهٌ] like جِذْعٌ and قُفْلٌ, of which
the pls. are also of the measure أَفْعَالٌ, because,
when you restore the ء which is the final radical,
and reject the medial radical [which is ت], you
say سَهٌ, with fet-h, (S, Mgh, *) which has both of
the meanings expl. above, as also سُهٌ, (K,) but
[SM says,] this last, mentioned by the author of
the K, is strange, and I have not seen it on the
authority of any one [else]: (TA:) and some say
سَتٌ, (IKh, S, Mgh, TA,) suppressing the final
radical [of سَتَهٌ], (S,) i. e., without ه at the end
and without hemzeh [or ا] at the beginning.
(TA.) [All are of the fem. gender.] It is said in
a trad., العَيْنُ وِكَآءُ السَّهِ, or, as some relate it,
السَّتِ, (S, Mgh, TA,) [The eye is the tie of the
anus,] meaning that when one [closes the eye
and] sleeps, the tie of the سَه becomes loosed, and
the excrement and wind issue. (TA.) And أَبُو
الأَسْتَاهِ means He who has large posteriors. (Az,
TA.) بِاسْتِ فُلَانٍ is a phrase of the Arabs significant of reviling; (S;) said when holding one in
contempt; meaning لَصِقَ العَارُ بِاسْتِ فُلَانٍ (assumed tropical:)  [May
disgrace cleave to the است of such a one]. (Mgh.)
And يَا ابْنَ اسْتِهَا (tropical:)  [O son of her است], (K, TA,)
a prov. of the Arabs, (TA,) is an allusion to one's
father's إِحْمَاض [see 2 in art. حمض] of the
former's mother; (Z, TA;) and is said to mean
أَنَّهُ وُلِدَ مِنِ اسْتِهَا: (TA:) and the Arabs called
the sons of the female slave بَنُو اسْتِهَا. (Sh, TA.)
And one says to a man who is deemed abject and
weak, اِسْتُ أُمِّكَ أَضْيَقُ [lit. Thy mother's است is
too contracted], and اِسْتُكَ أَضْيَقُ مِنْ أَنْ تَفْعَلَ كَذَا
وَ كَذَا [Thine است is too contracted, meaning
(assumed tropical:)  thine ability is too small, for thy doing such
and such things]: (TA: [see also Freytag's Arab.
Prov., i. 607:]) and أَنْتُمْ أَضْيَقُ أَسْتَاهًا مِنْ أَنْ تَفْعَلُوهُ
[in like manner] is an allusion to inability [meaning (assumed tropical:)  Ye are unable to do it]. (K.) The saying
of a poet,
وَ أَنْتَ مَكَانُكَ مِنْ وَائِلٍ
مَكَانُ القُرَادِ مِنِ اسْتِ الجَمَلْ
(tropical:)  [And thou, thy place in the tribe of Wáïl is
like the place of the tick in the rump of the
camel,] is tropical; for they do not [properly]
say اِسْتُ الجَمَلِ, but عَجُزُ الجَمَلِ. (S.) One
says also to a man who is deemed low, or base,
أَنْتَ الاِسْتُ السُّفْلَى, (TA,) and انت السبَّهُ السُّفْلَى,
meaning (assumed tropical:)  Thou art among others in the condition of the است of mankind: (S, TA:) and of
low, or base, men, one says, هٰؤُلَآءِ الأَسْتَاهُ; and of
such as are excellent, هٰؤُلَآءِ الأَعْيَانُ, and الوُجُوهُ.
(TA.) And one says, لَقِيتُ مِنْهُ اسْتَ الكَلْبَةِ, (A,
K,) a prov., (TA,) meaning (assumed tropical:)  I experienced
from him, or it, what I disliked, or hated. (A,
K, TA. [See also Freytag's Arab. Prov., ii. 445.])
And اِسْتُ البَائِنِ أَعْرَفُ, or أَعْلَمُ: see art. بين.
And مَا لَكَ اسْتٌ مَعِ اسْتِكَ (assumed tropical:)  Thou hast no one
[with thee] to assist thee: (A, K, TA:) another
prov., related on the authority of AZ as said to
one who has no large amount of property, nor
number of men. (Sgh, TA.) And تَرَكْتُهُ بِاسْتِ
الأَرْضِ, another prov., (TA,) meaning (assumed tropical:)  I left
him destitute, poor, (K, TA,) possessing nothing:
(TA:) or تَرَكْتُهُ بِاسْتِ المَتْنِ (assumed tropical:)  I left him on the
hard ground, alone. (Meyd.) And مَا لَكَ فِى هٰذَا
الأَمْرِ اسْتٌ وَ لَا فَمٌ (assumed tropical:)  Thou hast not in this thing,
or affair, root nor branch: Jereer says,
فَمَا لَكُمُ اسْتٌ فِى العَلَآءِ وَ لَآ فَمُ
[And ye have not any root in eminence, nor
branch]. (TA.) And كَانَ ذٰلِكَ عَلَى اسْتِ الدَّهْرِ
(tropical:)  That was in the beginning of time: (A, K, TA:)
or in the olden time; (AO, S, TA;) as also
عَلَى إِسِّ الدَّهْرِ. (AO, TA.) See also art. است.
[And see other exs. in Freytag's Arab. Prov. i. 355
and 378 (a variation of a prov. mentioned in the
preceding page) and 607 and 622 and 729-730.]
