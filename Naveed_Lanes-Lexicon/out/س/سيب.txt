Msb:) the latter signifies, accord. to Th, metals,
or minerals: (M, TA:) accord. to Aboo-Sa'eed,
veins of gold and of silver, that come into existence, and appear, in the mines: so called
because of their running (لِانْسِيَابِهَا) in the earth:
accord to Z, treasure buried in the Time of Ignorance: or metal, or mineral: (TA:) because of
the gift of God, (M, Z, Mgh, TA,) to him who
finds it. (Z, TA.) The Prophet said, (Mgh, TA,)
فِى السُّيُوبِ الخُمْسُ, i. e. In the case of رِكَاز, the
fifth part [is for the government-treasury]. (A,
Mgh, TA.)
-A2-  Also The hair of the tail of a
horse. (M, K.)
-A3-  And A pole with which a ship
or boat is propelled. (M, K.)
سِيبٌ A place, or channel, in which water runs:
(S, M, K:) or so سِيبُ مَآءٍ: (A:) pl. سُيُوبٌ. (M.)
-A2-  And The apple: in this sense a Pers. word
[arabicized]: and hence the name of [the celebrated grammarian] سِيبَوَيْهِ; as though meaning
“ the scent of apples; ” (M, K, * TA;) accord. to
Abu-l-'Alà, (M, TA,) and Seer: (TA:) by some,
[app. such as mispronounce it,] this name is said
to be from the Pers. سِىْ signifying “ thirty ” and
بُويَهْ signifying “ odour; ” as though meaning
“ thirty odours: ” (MF, TA:) and some say that
وَيْهِ is an ejaculation; and that the relaters of
traditions dislike pronouncing this name therewith,
as also other similar names, and therefore say
سِيبُويَهْ, changing the ه into ة, but pausing upon
it [so as to pronounce it ه]. (TA.)
سَيَابٌ and ↓ سُيَّابٌ (S, M, K) and ↓ سَيَّابٌ (K)

called] بَلَح: (S, M, K:) or [in the state in which
they are called] بُسْر: (K:) or green بُسْر: (AHn,
M:) As says that the flowers of the palm-tree
when they have become بَلَح are termed سَيَابٌ,
without teshdeed: (TA:) [but see بُسْرٌ:] the n. un.
is سَيَابَةٌ (S, M) and سُيَّابَةٌ (S) [and سَيَّابَةٌ]: Sh says
that they are called سَدَآء in the dial. of ElMedeeneh, and one is called سيابة in the dial. of
Wádi-l-Kurà: and he adds, I have heard the
Bahránees say ↓ سُيَّاب and سُيَّابَة. (TA.)
سَيَابَةٌ n. un. of سَيَابٌ; (S, M;) like as سُيَّابَةٌ is of
سُيَّابٌ. (S.) ―
-b2-  Also Wine. (K.)
سُيَّابٌ and سَيَّابٌ: see سَيَابٌ, in three places.
سَائِبٌ Running water. (Msb.) [See also سَيْبٌ,
first sentence.]
سَائِبَةٌ (tropical:)  Any beast that is left to pasture where
it will, without a pastor: (M, A, K: *) pl. سَوَائِبُ
and سُيَّبٌ. (A.) (assumed tropical:)  A camel that has lived until
his offspring have had offspring, and is therefore
set at liberty, and not ridden, (M, K,) nor laden
with a burden. (M.) In the Kur v. 102, (TA,)
(assumed tropical:)  A she-camel that was set at liberty to pasture
where it would, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) in the Time
of Ignorance, (S, K,) on account of a vow (S,
Mgh, Msb, K) and the like: (S, K:) or the
mother of a بَحِيرَة; (S, Mgh; [in the Msb, said
to be a بَحِيرَة (itself); and in one place in the TA
said to be a she-camel of which the dam is a
بَحِيرة; but both of these explanations require consideration, as will be seen from what follows;])
or (K) a she-camel which, having brought forth
females at ten successive births, was set at liberty
to pasture where she would, (S, K,) and not ridden,
nor was here milk drunk except by her young one
or a guest, until she died, when the men and the
women ate her together; and the ear of her last
female young one was slit, and she was [therefore]
called بَحِيرَة, and was a سَائِبَة like her mother:
(S:) or a she-camel of which a man, (M, IAth,
K,) in the Time of Ignorance, (M,) when he
came from a far journey, (M. IAth, K,) or re-
covered from a disease, (IAth, TA,) or had been
saved by his beast from difficulty or trouble, (M,
IAth,) or when his beast had been saved therefrom,
(K,) or from war, said, هِىَ سَائِبَةٌ; (M, IAth,
K;) i. e. she was left to pasture where she would,
without a pastor, and no use was made of her
back, nor was she debarred from water, nor from
herbage, nor ridden: (IAth, TA:) thus it signifies in the Kur: (M:) or a she-camel from
whose back a vertebra or [some other] bone was
taken forth, (M, K,) so that she became known
thereby, (M,) and which was not debarred from
water nor from herbage, nor ridden, (M, K,) nor
milked: (TA:) the pl. is سُيَّبٌ, like نُوَّحٌ pl. of
نَائِحَةٌ, and نُوَّمٌ pl. of نَائِمَةٌ; (S;) and سَوَائِبُ.
(TA.) It is said in a trad., “I saw 'Amr Ibn-Loheí dragging his intestines in the fire [of
Hell]: ” and he was the first who set at liberty
سَوَائِب: the doing of which is forbidden in the
Kur v. 102. (TA.) And it is related that a
hostile attack was made upon a certain man of the
Arabs, and he found not any [other] beast to
ride, so he rode a سَائِبَة: whereupon it was said
to him, “Dost thou ride what is forbidden? ” and
he replied, يَرْكَبُ الحَرَامَ مَنْ لَا حَلَالَ لَهُ [He
rides what is forbidden who has not what is
allowed]: and this saying became a proverb.
(M.) السَّائِبَتَانِ means The بَدَنَتَانِ [i. e. two
camels, or cows or bulls, for sacrifice,] which the
Prophet brought as offerings to the House [of
God at Mekkeh], and which one of the believers
in a plurality of gods took away: they are thus
called because he gave them up (سَيَّبَهُمَا) to God.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  Also (assumed tropical:)  A slave emancipated so that the
emancipator has no claim to inherit from him,
(S, M, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) except, accord. to EshSháfi'ee, in the case of the slave's dying without
appointing any heir, in which case his inheritance
belongs to his emancipator, (TA,) [for] such an
emancipated slave may bestow his property where
[or on whom] he pleases, (S, Mgh, Msb, TA,)
agreeably with a trad.: (Mgh, TA:) [in the S,
and in the Msb as on the authority of IF, it is
added, that “ this is what is related to have been
forbidden: ” but from what has been stated above,
this appears to be a mistake; and I think that
these words have been misplaced in the S and
Msb, and that they relate only to the she-camel
termed سَائِبَة:] a slave is thus emancipated by his
owner's saying to him, أَنْتَ سَائِبَةٌ. (S.) 'Omar
said, السَّائِبَةُ وَالصَّدَقَةُ لِيَوْمِهِمَا [The sáïbeh and alms
are for their day]: i. e., for the day of resurrection; so that one may not return to the deriving
of any advantage from them in the present world.
(AO, Mgh, TA.)
