سطو1
سَطَا بِهِ (S, M, Msb, K, &c.) and عَلَيْهِ (M,
Msb, K,) aor. يَسْطُو, (Msb,) inf. n. سَطْوٌ (S, M,
Msb, K) and سَطْوَةٌ, (M, Msb, K,) or the latter is
an inf. n. un., (S,) He sprang, or rushed, upon
him; made an assault, or attack, upon him; syn.
صَالَ: (M, K:) he sprang upon him and seized
him violently or laid violent hands upon him:
(Bd in xxii. 71:) he seized him violently with
uplifted hand: (Er-Rághib, TA:) he overbore
him, overpowered him, or subdued him, (قَهَرَهُ,
Lth, S, Msb, K, or تَطَاوَلَ عَلَيْهِ, T, TA,) by
seizing him violently, or laying violent hands
upon him, (Lth, S, K,) and abased him; or he
seized him with great violence: (Msb:) or he
stretched forth his hand to him [to seize him].
(Th, M, TA.) And in like manner, (M,) one
says of a stallion [camel], يَسْطُو عَلَى طَرُوقَتِهِ
[He springs, or rushes, upon, or he overbears, the
she-camel that he covers]. (S, M. *) ―
-b2-  سَطَا عَلَى
النَّاقَةِ, (S, M, K,) and الفَرَسِ, inf. n. سَطْوٌ and
سُطُوٌّ, (M,) He (the pastor) put his hand into the
رَحِم [or vulva] of the she-camel, (S, M, K,) and
of the mare, (M,) to extract, (S, K,) or and
extracted, (M,) the sperma of the stallion: (S,
M, K:) when this is not extracted, the she-camel
does not conceive: (S:) or this is done when she
has been leaped by a stallion of low race; or when
the sperma is bad, and she has not conceived in
consequence of it. (M.) And He extracted from
her (i. e. a she-camel, TA) the fœtus, dead: (M,
TA:) and مَسَطَ signifies “ he extracted the sperma
of the stallion: ” thus Az distinguishes between
the two verbs. (TA.) Accord. to IAar, one
says, سَطَا عَلَى الحَامِلِ, and سَاطَ, which is formed
by transposition, meaning He extracted the fœtus,
or young one, of the pregnant female. (TA.)
And A'Obeyd mentions السَّطْوُ as used in relation
to a woman: it is said in a trad. of El-Hasan,
لَا بَأْسَ أَنْ يَسْطُوَ الرَّجُلُ عَلَى المَرْأَةِ [There is, or
will be, no harm in the man's extracting the
fœtus of the woman]; (M, TA;) which Lth
explains by saying, when her child sticks fast in
her belly, dead, it may be extracted [by him]
when fear is entertained for her and a woman is
not found to do this. (TA.) ―
-b3-  سَطَا said of a
horse, (M, K,) inf. n. سَطْوٌ, (M,) He went at
random, heedlessly, or in a headlong manner, not
obeying guidance. (M, K.) ―
-b4-  Also, said of a
horse, He went with wide step: (S, M, K:) or
raised his tail in running; the doing of which is
approved. (M.) ―
-b5-  Also (tropical:)  It was, or became,
abundant, or copious; said of water. (S, M,
Msb, K, TA.) ―
-b6-  And (tropical:)  He tasted food; (K,
TA;) and took it with the hand, or with the
extended hand. (TA.) ―
-b7-  And i. q. عَاقَبَ [app.
as meaning He punished: see سَطْوَةٌ, below].
(M, TA.) ―
-b8-  And سَطَاهَا He compressed her;
[and so سَطَأَهَا and شَطَأَهَا;] on the authority of
Aboo-Sa'eed. (TA.)
3
ساطاهُ, (K,) inf. n. مُسَاطَاةٌ, (TA,) He treated
him with hardness, severity, or rigour: (K, TA:)
so says Az, on the authority of IAar. (TA.) ―
-b2-
And He treated him with gentleness, or tenderness.
(IAar, T, TA.) Thus it has two contr. significations. (TA.)
سَطْوَةٌ [as a simple subst., or] as an inf. n. un.,
has for its pl. سَطَوَاتٌ. (S.) It signifies [A
spring, or rush; or an assault, or attack: &c.:
(see 1, first sentence:) impetuosity in war or
battle:] a reviling: a beating: and punishment,
or chastisement; as in the saying, اِتَّقِ سَطْوَتَهُ
[Guard thyself against his punishment, or chastisement; or it may mean in this phrase, his
violence, or impetuosity]. (TA.)
سَاطٍ [act. part. n. of 1, Springing, or rushing;
making an assault, or attack: &c. ―
-b2-  Hence,]
applied to a horse, That springs, or rushes, upon
other horses, and stands upon his hind legs and
attacks with his fore legs: (T, TA: [in the Ham
p. 383, and raises his fore legs:]) or a horse
wide in step: (As, S, M, K:) or that attacks
other horses: (S:) or that raises his tail in his
running; (S, M, K;) the doing of which is
approved. (M.) ―
-b3-  And A stallion-camel excited
by lust, and going forth from camels to other
camels (S, K) in consequence thereof. (S.) ―
-b4-
And What is tall, or long, (K, TA,) of camels
&c. (TA.) ―
-b5-  الأَيْدِى السَّوَاطِى The hands that
reach, or take, or take hold of, a thing. (TA.)
