سحر1
سَحَرَهُ He, or it, hit, or hurt, his سَحْر [or
lungs, &c.], (Mgh, TA,) or his سُحْرَة [i. e. heart].
(TA.) ―
-b2-  And the same, aor.
سَحَرَ, inf. n. سِحْرٌ, (T,
TA,) [said to be] the only instance of a pret. and
aor. and inf. n. of these measures except the verb
فَعَلَ, aor. يَفْعَلُ, inf. n. فِعْلٌ, (MF,) (tropical:)  He turned
it, (T,) or him, (TA,) عَنْ وَجْهِهِ [from its, or his,
course, or way, or manner of being]: and hence
other significations here following. (T, TA.
[Accord. to the T, this seems to be proper; but
accord. to the A, tropical.]) In this sense the
verb is used in the Kur xxiii. 91. (Fr.) The
Arabs say to a man, مَا سَحَرَكَ عَنْ وَجْهِ كَذَا وَ كَذَا
(tropical:)  What has turned thee from such and such a
course? (Yoo.) أُفِكَ and سُحِرَ are syn. [as meaning (tropical:)  He was turned from his course &c.]. (TA.)
―
-b3-  And (tropical:)  He turned him from hatred to love.
(TA.) ―
-b4-  Hence, (TA,) aor. and inf. n. as above,
(T, S, TA,) and inf. n. also سَحْرٌ, (KL, TA,) (tropical:)  He
enchanted, or fascinated, him, or it; (S, * K, *
KL, PS;) and so ↓ سحّرهُ (MA, TA) [in an
intensive or a frequentative sense, meaning he
enchanted, or fascinated, him, or it, much, or (as
shown by an explanation of its pass. part. n.)
time after time]: and سَحَرَ عَيْنَهُ He enchanted, or
fascinated, his eye. (MA.) You say, سَحَرَ
الشَّىْءَ عَنْ وَجْهِهِ, meaning (tropical:)  He (an enchanter,
سَاحِرٌ) apparently turned the thing from its
proper manner of being, making what was false
to appear in the form of the true, or real;
causing the thing to be imagined different from
what it really was. (T, TA. [See سِحْرٌ, below.])
And المَرْأَةُ تَسْحَرُ النَّاسَ بِعَيْنِهَا (tropical:)  [The woman enchants, or fascinates, men by her eye]. (A.)
And سَحَرَهُ بِكَلَامِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He caused him, or enticed
him, to incline to him by his soft, or elegant,
speech, and by the beauty of its composition.
(Msb.) ―
-b5-  (tropical:)  He deceived, deluded, beguiled, circumvented, or outwitted, him; (S, Mgh, K; *)
as also ↓ سحّرهُ, [but app. in an intensive or a frequentative sense,] (K, TA,) inf. n. تَسْحِيرٌ. (TA.
[Accord. to the Mgh, the former verb in this
sense seems to be derived from the same verb in
the first of the senses expl. in this art.]) ―
-b6-  And
in like manner, (assumed tropical:)  He diverted him [with a thing],
as one diverts a child with food, that he may be
contented, and not want milk; syn. عَلَّلَهُ; as also
↓ سحّرهُ, inf. n. تَسْحِيرٌ. (S, TA.) One says,
سَحَرَهُ بِالطَّعَامِ وَ الشَّرَابِ, and ↓ سحّرهُ, (assumed tropical:)  He fed
him, and diverted him [from the feeling of want],
with meat and drink. (TA.) ―
-b7-  And سَحَرْتُ
الفِضَّةَ (assumed tropical:)  I gilded the silver. (Ham p. 601.) ―
-b8-
سِحْرٌ is also syn. with فَسَادٌ [as quasi-inf. n. of
أَفْسَدَ, as is indicated in the TA; thus signifying
The act of corrupting, marring, spoiling, &c.:
see the pass. part. n. مَسْحُورٌ]. (TA.) [Hence,]
one says, سَحَرَ المَطَرُ الطِّينَ and التُّرَابَ, (assumed tropical:)  The
rain spoiled the clay, and the earth, or dust, so
that it was not fit for use. (TA.) ―
-b9-  And one
says of the adhesion of the lungs to the side by
reason of thirst, يَسْحَرُ أَلْبَانَ الغَنَمِ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  It
causes the milk of the sheep, or goats, to descend

TA.)
-A3-  سَحِرَ, aor.
سَحَرَ, (assumed tropical:)  He went forth early in
the morning, in the first part of the day; or

سحّر, inf. n. تَسْحِيرٌ: see 1, in four places. ―
-b2-
Also (tropical:)  He fed another, or others, with the food,
or meal, called the سَحُور: (M, Mgh, TA:) or
سَحَّرَهُمْ signifies he gave to them the meal so
called. (Mgh.)
4
اسحر (tropical:)  He was, or became, in the time
called the سَحَر; (S, A, K;) as also ↓ استحر.
(TA.) And (tropical:)  He went, or journeyed, in the time
so called: (S, K, TA:) or he rose to go, or journey, in that time; and so ↓ استحر: (TA:) or this
latter signifies he went forth in that time. (A.
[See also 1, last sentence.])
5
تسحّر (A, Mgh, Msb) and تسحّر السَّحُورَ
(Az, TA) (tropical:)  He ate the food, or meal, [or drank
the draught of milk,] called the سَحُور. (Az, A,
Mgh, Msb, TA.) ―
-b2-  And تسحّر بِهِ (tropical:)  He ate it,
(S, * K, * TA,) namely, food, or سَوِيق [q. v.], [or
drank it, namely, milk,] at the time called the
سَحَر. (TA.)
8
استحر: see 4, in two places. ―
-b2-  Also (assumed tropical:)  He
(a cock) crowed at the time called the سَحَر: (S,
K:) and he (a bird) sang, warbled, or uttered his
voice, at that time. (TA.)
سَحْرٌ, and ↓ سَحَرٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) sometimes thus because of the faucial letter, (S,) and
↓ سُحْرٌ, (S, Msb, K,) and, accord. to El-Khafájee,
in the 'Ináyeh, ↓ سِحْرٌ, but this is not mentioned
by any other, and therefore requires confirmation,
(TA,) The lungs, or lights: (S, A, Mgh, Msb,
K:) or what adheres to the gullet and the windpipe, of [the contents of] the upper part of the
belly: or all that hangs to the gullet, consisting of
the heart and liver and lungs: (Msb, TA:) and
the part of the exterior of the body corresponding
to the place of the lungs: (Mgh, TA: *) and
سَحْرٌ signifies also the liver; and the core, or
black or inner part, (سَوَاد,) and sides, or regions,
of the heart: (TA:) and ↓ سُحْرٌ, the heart; (ElJarmee, K;) as also ↓ سُحْرَةٌ: (TA:) the pl. (of
سَحْرٌ, S, Msb) is سُحُورٌ, and (of ↓ سُحْرٌ, S, Msb,
and of ↓ سَحَرٌ, Msb) أَسْحَارٌ. (S, Msb, K.) ―
-b2-
Hence, اِنْتَفَخَ سَحْرُهُ, (S, A, K,) and اِنْتَفَخَتْ
↓ مَسَاحِرُهُ, (A, K,) (tropical:)  His lungs became inflated,
or swollen, by reason of timidity and cowardice:
(A:) said of a coward: (S:) and of one who has
exceeded his due bounds: Lth says that, when
repletion arises in a man, one says انتفخ سحره,
and that the meaning is, [as given also in the
K,] he exceeded his due bounds: but Az says that
this is a mistake, and that this phrase is only said
of a coward, whose inside is filled with fear, and
whose lungs are inflated, or swollen, so that the
heart is raised to the gullet: and of the same
kind is the phrase in the Kur [xxxiii. 10]
وَبَلَغَتِ القُلُوبُ الحَنَاجِرَ. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And المُقَطَّعَةُ
الأَسْحَارِ, and السُّحُورِ, (assumed tropical:)  [She that has her lungs
burst asunder], an appellation given to the أَرْنَب
[i. e. hare, or female hare], (S, K,) or to the
swift ارنب, (TA in art. قطع,) by way of good
omen, meaning that her lungs will burst asunder;
like المُقَطَّعَةُ النِّيَاطِ: (S:) and some (of those of
later times, S) say المُقَطِّعَةُ, with kesr to the ط;
(S, K;) as though, by her speed and vehemence
of running, she would burst asunder her lungs;
(S;) or because she bursts the lungs of the dogs
by the vehemence of her running, and the lungs
of him who purses her. (ISh, Sgh.) ―
-b4-  And
اِنْقَطَعَ مِنْهُ سَحْرِى (tropical:)  I despaired of him, or it.
(A, K.) And أَنَا مِنْهُ غَيْرُ صَرِيمِ سَحْرٍ (tropical:)  I am not

صُرِمَ سَحْرُهُ means (tropical:)  His hope was cut off. (TA.)
-A2-  Also The scar of a gall on the back of a
camel, (K, TA,) when it has healed, and the
place thereof has become white. (TA.)
-A3-  And

-A4-  See also سَحَّارَةٌ.
-A5-  And see سَحَرٌ, in two
places.
سُحْرٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in
three places.
سِحْرٌ: see سَحْرٌ, first sentence.
-A2-  [Also] an
inf. n. of سَحَرَهُ, meaning (tropical:)  The turning a thing
from its proper manner of being to another
manner: (T, TA: [accord. to the T, this seems
to be proper; but accord. to the A, tropical:])
and hence, (T, TA,) (tropical:)  enchantment, or fascination: (T, * S, * MA, KL, PS:) for when. the
enchanter (السَّاحِرُ) makes what is false to appear
in the form of truth, and causes a thing to be
imagined different from what it really is, it is as
though he turned it from its proper manner of
being: (T, TA:) the producing what is false in
the form of truth: (IF, Msb:) or, in the common
conventional language of the law, any event of
which the cause is hidden, and which is imagined
to be different from what it really is: and embellishment by falsification, and deceit: (Fakhred-Deen, Msb:) or a performance in which one
allies himself to the devil, and which is effected
by his aid: (TA:) i. q. أَخْذَةٌ [meaning a kind of
enchantment, or fascination, which captivates the
eye and the like, and by which enchantresses
withhold their husbands from other women]: (S:)
and anything of which the way of proceeding or
operation (مَأْخَذُهُ) is subtile: (S, K:) accord. to
Ibn-Abee-'Áïsheh, سِحْر is thus called by the
Arabs because it changes health, or soundness, to
disease: (Sh:) [and in like manner it is said to
change hatred to love: (see 1:)] pl. أَسْحَارٌ and
سُحُورٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also (tropical:)  Skilful eloquence: (TA:)
or used absolutely, it is applied to that for which
the agent is blamed: and when restricted, to that
which is praiseworthy. (Msb.) Thus it is in the
saying of Mohammad, إِنَّ مِنَ البَيَانِ لَسِحْرًا
(tropical:)  [Verily there is a kind of eloquence that is
enchantment]: because the speaker propounds an
obscure matter, and discloses its true meaning by
the beauty of his eloquence, inclining the hearts
[of his hearers] in like manner as they are inclined
by سِحْر: or because there is in eloquence a
novelty and strangeness of composition which
attracts the hearer and brings him to such a pass
as almost diverts him from other things; therefore it is likened to سِحْر properly so called: and
it is said to be السِّحْرُ الحَلَالُ [or lawful enchantment]. (Msb.) The saying of Mohammad mentioned above was uttered on the following
occasion: Keys Ibn-'Ásim El-Minkaree and EzZibrikán Ibn-Bedr and 'Amr Ibn-El-Ahtam came
to the Prophet, who asked 'Amr respecting EzZibrikán; whereupon he spoke well of him: but
Ez-Zibrikán was not content with this, and said,
“ By God, O apostle of God, he knows that I
am more excellent than he has said; but he
envies the place that I have in thine estimation: ”
and thereupon 'Amr spoke ill of him; and then
said, “By God, I did not lie of him in the first
saying nor in the other; but he pleased me, and I
spoke as pleased; then he angered me, and I
spoke as angered: ” then Mohammad uttered the
above-mentioned words. (TA.) Their meaning
is, but God knows best, he praises the man,
speaking truth respecting him, so as to turn the
hearts of the hearers to him, (K,) or to what he
says; (TA;) and he dispraises him, speaking
truth respecting him, so as to turn their hearts
also to him, (K,) or to what he says after. (TA.)
A' Obeyd says nearly the same. Or, as some say,
the meaning is, that there is an eloquence that is
sinful like سِحْر. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Also (tropical:)  Skill; science:
Mohammad said, مَنْ تَعَلَّمَ بَابًا مِنَ النُّجُومِ فَقَدْ
تَعَلَّمَ بَابًا مِنَ السِّحْرِ (tropical:)  [He who learneth a process
of the science of the stars (meaning astrology or
astronomy) learneth a process of enchantment],
which may mean that the science of the stars is
forbidden to be learned, like the science of enchantment, and that the learning of it is an act of
infidelity: or it may mean that it is skill, and
science; referring to what is acquired thereof by
way of calculation; as the knowledge of eclipses
of the sun or moon, and the like. (ISd, TA.) ―
-b4-
Also (tropical:)  Food; aliment; nutriment: so called because its effect is subtile. (TA.) ―
-b5-  غَيْثٌ ذُو سِحْرٍ
means (assumed tropical:)  Superabundant rain. (TA.)
سَحَرٌ: see سَحْرٌ, in two places.
-A2-  Also, (S, A,
Mgh, Msb, K, &c.,) and ↓ سَحْرٌ, (TA,) and ↓ سُحُرٌ,
(Msb,) and ↓ سَحَرِىٌّ, and ↓ سَحَرِيَّةٌ, (K,) (tropical:)  The
time a little before daybreak: (S, K:) or [simply]
before daybreak: (Msb:) or the last part of the
night: (Lth, Mgh:) or the last sixth of the night:
(Mgh:) the pl. of سَحَرٌ (Msb) and of ↓ سَحْرٌ
(TA) and of ↓ سُحُرٌ, (Msb,) is أَسْحَارٌ: (Msb, K,
TA:) the سَحَر is thus met. called because it is the
time of the departure of the night and the coming
of the day; so that it is the مُتَنَفَّس [lit. the “ time
of the breathing,” by which is meant the “ shining
forth,”] of the dawn: (A:) there are two times
of which each is thus called; one, which is
[specially] called السَّحَرُ الأَعْلَى, [or the earlier
سَحَر,] (A, Mgh,) is before daybreak; (Mgh;) or
a little before daybreak: (A:) and the other, at
daybreak: (A, Mgh:) like as one says “ the
false dawn ” and “ the true: ” (A:) the earlier
سَحَر is also called ↓ سُحْرَةٌ: (S, K:) or the
سُحْرَة is the same as the سَحَر: or it is the last
third of the night, to daybreak. (TA.) Using
سَحَر indeterminately, you make it perfectly decl.,
and say, أَتَيْتُهُ بِسَحَرٍ [I came to him a little before
daybreak], agreeably with the phrase in the Kur
liv. 34; (S;) and in like manner, ↓ بِسُحْرَةٍ [in the
earlier سَحَر]: (S, K:) you also say سَحَرًا, and
↓ سُحْرَةً, (A,) and سَحَرًا مِنَ الأَسْحَارِ: and مَا زَالَ
عِنْدَنَا مُنْذُ السَّحَرِ [He ceased not to be with us, or
at our abode, from a little before daybreak]: and
لَقِيتُهُ بِالسَّحَرِ الأَعْلَى, and بِأَعْلَى سَحَرَيْنِ, and
بِأَعْلَى السَّحَرَيْنِ, (TA,) and فِى أَعْلَى السَّحَرَيْنِ,
(A, TA,) [I met him in the earlier سَحَر;] but
بِأَعْلَى سَحَرٍ, a phrase used by El-'Ajjáj, is erroneous: (TA:) and هٰذِهِ اللَّيْلَةِ ↓ لَقِيتُهُ سَحَرِىَّ and
↓ سَحَرِيَّتَهَا [I met him in the time a little before
daybreak of this last night]. (TA.) When, by
سَحَر alone, you mean the سَحَر of the night immediately preceding, you say, لَقِيتُهُ سَحَرَ يَا هٰذَا
[I met him a little before daybreak this last night,
O thou man], (S, K,) making it imperfectly decl.
because it is altered from السَّحَرَ, (S,) or because
it is for بِالسَّحَرِ; (TA;) and it is thus determinate
by itself, (S, K,) without its being prefixed to
another noun and without ال: (S:) and in the
same sense you say بِسَحَرَ: (TA:) and you say,
سِرْ عَلَى فَرَسِكَ سَحَرَ يَا فَتَى [Go thou on thy
horse a little before daybreak this night, O youth:
so in the TA; but in two copies of the S, for
سِرْ I find سِيرَ]: you do not make it to terminate
with damm, [like قَبْلُ and بَعْدُ &c.,] because it is
an adv. n. which, in a place where it is fitting to
be such, may not be used otherwise than as such:
(S:) and [in like manner] you say, ↓ لَقِيتُهُ سُحْرَةَ
يَا هٰذَا [I met him in the earlier سَحَر of this last
night, O thou man]. (TA.) If you make سَحَر
the proper name of a man, it is perfectly decl.:
and so is the dim.; for it is not of the measure of
a noun made to deviate from its original from,
like أُخَرُ: you say, ↓ سِرْ عَلَى فَرَسِكَ سُحَيْرًا [Go
thou on thy horse a very little before daybreak:
so in the TA; but here again, in two copies of
the S, for سِرْ I find سِيرَ]: you do not make it to
terminate with damm, [like قَبْلُ &c.,] because its
being made of the dim. form does not bring it
into the class of adv. ns. which may also be used
as nouns absolutely, though it does bring it into
the class of nouns which are perfectly declinable.
(S, TA.) ―
-b2-  سَحَرٌ also signifies (tropical:)  Whiteness overspreading blackness; (K;) like صَحَرٌ; except that
the former is mostly used in relation to the time
so called, of daybreak; and the latter, in relation
to colours, as when one says حِمَارٌ أَصْحَرُ; (TA;)
and ↓ سُحْرَةٌ signifies the same; (TA;) i. q.
صُحْرَةٌ. (K.) ―
-b3-  And (tropical:)  The extremity (T, A, K)
of a desert, (T,) and of the earth or a land, (A,)

[particularly] سَوِيق [generally meaning meal of
parched barley], that is eaten at the time called
the سَحَر; (S, * Mgh, Msb, K* TA;) or a draught
of milk that is drunk at that time. (TA.) It is repeatedly mentioned in trads. [relating to Ramadán,
when the Muslim is required to be exact in the
time of this meal], and mostly as above; but some
say that it is correctly [in these cases] with damm,
[i. e. سُحُور, which see below,] because the blessing and recompense have respect to the action,
and not to the food. (TA.)
سُحُورٌ, an inf. n. [without a verb properly belonging to it, or rather a quasi-inf. n., for its
verb is تَسَحَّرَ], (TA,) The act of eating the meal,
or food, [or drinking the draught of milk,] called
the سَحُور [q. v.]. (Msb, TA.)
سَحِيرٌ: see مَسْحُورٌ. ―

سُحَيْرًا: see سَحَرٌ, in the latter half of the paragraph.
سُحَارَةٌ The parts, of a sheep or goat, that the

and the windpipe, (K, TA,) and the appendages
of these. (TA.)
سَحَّارٌ: see سَاحِرٌ, in two places.
سَحَّارَةٌ (tropical:)  A certain plaything of children; (A,
K, TA;) having a string attached to it; (A;)
which, when extended in one direction, turns out
to be of one colour; and when extended in another
direction, turns out to be of another colour: (A, *
TA:) it is also called ↓ سَحْرٌ: and whatever. resembles it is called by the former appellation: so
says Lth. (TA.)
سَاحِرٌ (tropical:)  [An enchanter;] a man who practices
سِحْر; as also ↓ سَحَّارٌ [in an intensive sense, or
denoting habit or frequency]: pl. of the former
سَحَرَةٌ and سُحَّارٌ; and of ↓ the latter, سَحَّارُونَ
only, for it has no broken pl. (TA.) [Hence,]
one says, لَهَا عَيْنٌ سَاحِرَةٌ (tropical:)  [She has an enchanting,
or a fascinating, eye], and عُيُونٌ سَوَاحِرُ [enchanting, or fascinating, eyes]. (A, TA.) And أَرْضٌ

lungs]; (Bd, TA;) or created with سَحْر [or
lungs]; (S;) i. e. a human being: (Bd:) or
diverted [from want] with food and drink: (S, *
TA:) and this seems to be implied by the explanation in the K; which is hollow; from Fr:
(TA:) or enchanted time after time, so that his
intellect is disordered, or rendered unsound: (A,
TA:) or enchanted much, so that his reason is
overcome: (Bd, Jel:) [see also مَسْحُورٌ:] or deceived, deluded, beguiled, circumvented, or outwitted. (TA.)
