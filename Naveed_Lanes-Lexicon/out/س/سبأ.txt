سَبَاَ, (M, K,) inf. n.
سَبْءٌ (S, M, K) and سِبَآءٌ, (M, K, TA,) like
كِتَابٌ, (TA, in the CK سَباء,) [but see سِبَآءٌ below,] and مَسْبَأٌ; (S, K;) and ↓ استبأها; (S, M, K;)
He bought wine, syn. شَرَاهَا, (M, K,) which
mostly means “ he sold it,” (TA,) or اِشْتَرَاهَا,
(S, O,) which is well known as meaning “ he
bought it,” wherefore it is here used in the S and
O, (TA,) in order that he might drink it: (S,
O:) accord. to Ks, (TA,) when you buy wine to
carry it to a place, you say, سَبَيْتُ الخَمْرَ, without
ء; (S, TA;) and so say the [other] celebrated
lexicologists, except Fei, accord. to whom you
say in this case [as in others], سَبَأْتُهَا; and it is
itself called سَبِيْئَةٌ: (TA:) the verbs are only
used, in the sense of buying, in relation to wine.
(S, Msb, TA.) [See also art. سبى.] ―
-b2-  And
سَبَأَ الشَّرَابَ He collected the wine in vessels:
occurring in this sense in a trad. (Aboo-Moosà,
TA.)
-A2-  سَبَأَتْهُ, (M,) or سَبَأَتِ الجِلْدَ, (K,) said
of fire, (M, K,) and of whips, (M,) It, or they,
burned, or hurt, (M, K,) or, as some say, (M,
but in the K “ and,”) altered, (M, K,) him,
(M,) or the skin: (K:) and in like manner one
says of the sun, and of fever, and of journeying.
(M.) ―
-b2-  And سَبَأْتُهُ بِالنَّارِ I burned him with fire:
(AZ, S:) or سَبَأَ جِلْدَهُ, inf. n. سَبْءٌ, He burned
his skin; or, as some say, stripped it off: (M:)
or سَبَأَ الجِلْدَ he burned the skin: and سَبَأَ signifies
also he stripped off [skin], or he skinned. (K.)
―
-b3-  And سَبَأْتُ الرَّجُلَ, (inf. n. سَبْءٌ, TA,) I
flogged the man. (S, K. *)
-A3-  سَبَأَ عَلَى يَمِينٍ
كَاذِبَةٍ, (S, M,) aor.
سَبَاَ, inf. n. سَبْءٌ, (M,) He
passed over a false oath [that he had sworn], not
caring for it: (S): or he swore a false oath: and
some say, سَبَأَ عَلَى يَمِينٍ, aor. and inf. n. as
above, meaning he passed over an oath [that he
had sworn], lying. (M.)
-A4-  سَبَأَ is also syn. with
صَافَحَ [He took by the hand: &c.]: (O, K:)
deemed by MF a strange meaning. (TA.)

(Sh, TA in art. رطم.) ―
-b2-  اسبأ لِأَمْرِ اللّٰهِ He,
(M, K,) or his heart, (L,) was, or became, submissive to the decree of God. (M, L, K.) ―
-b3-
And اسبأ عَلَى الشَّىْءِ His heart became in a bad
state, or heavy, (خَبُثَ, [so in the M and in a copy
of the K, in the CK and TA خَبَتَ, and thus in
my MS. copy of the K, but there altered from
خَبُثَ, app. on the authority of the TA, and I
think it a mistranscription, although expl. in the
TA as meaning اِنْخَضَعَ, which is a signification
of أَخْبَتَ, the explanation of اسبأ in the next preceding sentence,]) at the thing. (M, K.)
7
انسبأ It (the skin) was, or became, stripped.
off. (S, M.) ―

سَبَأٌ: see سَبِيْئَةٌ
-A2-  تَفَرَّقُوا أَيْدِى سَبَا, and أَيَادِى
سَبَا, (M, K,) and with ذَهَبُوا in the place of تفرّقوا,
(T, TA,) They became scattered, or dispersed,
(K, TA,) and they went away in a state of dispersion, in the ways of Seba, (T, TA,) a people
of El-Yemen, who were dispersed in consequence
of the inundation of their lands by the bursting
of their [famous] dam, (TA,) and who became
proverbial on that account: (M, K, TA:) سَبَا is
here made indecl., (M, K, TA, [بَنُوهُ in the CK
being a mistranscription for بَنَوْهُ, wherefore كما
تَبَدَّد has been there interpolated, immediately
before بَنُوهُ,]) with the last letter quiescent, and
forms, with the preceding word, a compound like
خَمْسَةَ عَشَرَ [which implies that we should read
أَيْدِى سَبَا and أَيَادِىَسَبَا, but I have never found
it thus written]: (TA:) it is not formed from
سَبَأَ by suppression of the ء, but is a substitute for
that word, (M, K, TA,) on account of the frequent use of this phrase. (M, TA.) [See also
art. سبى.]
سُبْأَةٌ A long, or far, journey, (IAar, T, M, K,)
that alters one: (IAar, M, TA:) so termed because the sun alters him who makes a long
journey. (T, TA. [See 1.]) You say, إِنَّكَ لَتُرِيدُ
سُبْأَةً Verily thou desirest a long journey, (IAar,
M, K, *) that will alter thee. (IAar, M.) In the
case of a short journey, you say, تُرِيدُ سُرْبَةً.
(T, TA.)
السَّبَئِيَّةُ, (S, and so in a copy of the K,) or
↓ السَّبَائِيَّةُ; (so in another copy of the K and
accord. to the CK;) MF says that the former is
the correct term, but both are correct; (TA;)
Certain of the غُلَاة, (S, K, TA,) i. e. extravagant
zealots of the class of innovators; a party of the
غُلَاة of the شِيعَة [q. v.]; who are divided into
eighteen sects: (TA:) they are so called in relation to Seba (سَبَأ) the father of 'Abd-Allah, (K,)
or in relation to 'Abd-Allah Ibn-Seba. (S.)
سِبَآءٌ [The purchase of wine;] a subst. from
سَبَأَ الخَمْرَ; (S;) or an inf. n. (M, K, TA.)
-A2-
See also سَبِيْئَةٌ, in two places.
سَبِىْءٌ The skin, or slough, of a serpent; (K;)

(TA.)
سَبِيْئَةٌ (S, M, K) and ↓ سِبَآءٌ (M, K) and, accord.
to Ks, ↓ سَبَأْ, but the form commonly known is
↓ سِبَآءٌ, with kesr to the س, and with medd, (IAmb,
TA,) Wine, (S, M, K,) in an absolute sense;
(TA;) or, [as is perhaps meant in the S,] wine
that is bought to be drunk, not for merchandise.
(Har p. 409, in explanation of the first word.)
[See an ex. of the second in a verse of Lebeed
cited in art. دكن: and see also سَبِيَّةٌ, in art. سبى.]
السَّبَائِيَّةُ: see السَّبَئِيَّةُ, above.
سَبَّآءٌ A vintner, or seller of wine. (S, M, K.) ―
-b2-
[It is said in a marginal note in my MS. copy of
the K that it signifies also A seller of graveclothes: but this is evidently a mistake, app.
occasioned by a mistranscription, for سَيَّآء, with ى.]
مَسْبَأٌ A road (S, K) in a mountain. (S.)
