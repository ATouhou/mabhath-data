(L;) He lied, affected lying, or lied purposely;
and forged, or fabricated: (S, L, K: [in the

انسدج He fell prostrate; fell upon his
face; (O, K, TA;) like him who is prostrating
himself in prayer: (TA:) [it may perhaps be a
mistranscription for انسدح; which seems to be
better known in this sense: but it is said to be]
formed by transposition from انسجد and [so]
اندسج. (TA.)
سَدَاجَةٌ, used by Ibn-El-Khateeb and others of
the people of El-Andalus, [and by post-classical
writers of other countries,] as meaning Easiness,
and goodness of nature or disposition, [or rather
simplicity, or plainness, of mind or manners,] is
from سَاذَجٌ, an arabicized word from [the Pers.]
سَادَهْ, signifying, with them, “free in intellect,”
and “ easy in nature or disposition: ” frequent
usage occasioned the change of the ذ into د.
(TA. [See De Sacy's Chrest. Ar., 2nd ed.,
ii. 292.])
سَدَّاجٌ A great, or habitual, liar, (S, O, L, K,)
