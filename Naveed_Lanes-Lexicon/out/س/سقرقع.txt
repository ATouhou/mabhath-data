سقرقعسُقُرْقَعٌ, an arabicized word from سُكُرْكَه, (S,
K,) [or سُكُرْگَهْ, so written in Persian,] A certain
beverage, (O, K,) the wine of the Abyssinians,
(S,) made from ذُرَة [or millet]: (S, K:) or a
certain beverage of the people of El-Hijáz, from
barley and [other] grains; to which they have
become addicted: (Lth, K:) Lth says, (TA,) it is
an Abyssinian word, (K, TA,) not of the language
of the Arabs, because (TA) there is not in the
language a quinqueliteral-radical word having
damm to the first syllable and fet-h to the last,
(K, TA,) except such as is reduplicative, like
ذُرَحْرَحٌ. (TA.) [See also سُكُرْكَةٌ, and مِزْرٌ, and
غُبَيْرَآءُ.]
