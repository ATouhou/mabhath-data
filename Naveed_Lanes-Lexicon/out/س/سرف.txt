سرف1
سَرِفَ, aor.
سَرَفَ, inf. n. سَرَفٌ, He was ignorant:
or he was unmindful, negligent, or heedless.
(Msb.) [In these senses it is trans.: you say,]
سَرِفَهُ, (S, M, K,) aor.
سَرَفَ, (K,) inf. n. سَرَفٌ, (S, *
M, K, *) He was unmindful, negligent, or heedless, of it; (S, M, K;) namely, a thing: (S, M:)
and he was ignorant of it: (S, K:) and he missed
it; (S, * M, K; * [in the first and third of which,
only the inf. n. of the verb in this sense in mentioned, and expl. as syn. with خَطَأٌ;]) syn. أَخْطَأَهُ.
(M.) And طَلَبْتُهُمْ فَسَرِفْتُهُمْ I sought them and
missed them: or was ignorant of them. (Msb.)
And سَرِفَ القَوْمَ He passed by the people, or
party, and left them behind him. (M.) As
relates, of an Arab of the desert, with whom
some companions of his made an appointment to
meet him in a certain place of the mosque, and to
whom he broke his promise, that, being asked
respecting that, he said, مَرَرْتُ بِكُمْ فَسَرِفْتُكُمْ, meaning [I passed by you and] I was unmindful of
you. (S.) And hence the saying of Jereer, (S,
TA,) praising the Benoo-Umeiyeh, (TA,)
أَعْطَوْا هُنَيْدَةَ يَحْدُوهَا ثَمَانِيَةٌ
مَا فِى عَطَائِهِمُ مِنٌّ وَلَا سَرَفُ
meaning [They gave a hundred camels, eight
persons driving them, or urging them by singing
to them: there was not in their gift reproach for
a benefit conferred, nor] unmindfulness: or the
meaning is, nor missing (خَطَأٌ); that is, they did
not miss the proper place of the gift by their
giving it to such as did not deserve it and refusing it to the deserving. (S, TA.) You say
also, سَرِفْتُ يَمِينَهُ I was unacquainted with, or
knew not, his oath. (TA.) ―

صَعِقَ are quasi-passives of the verbs in the phrases

(S, TA:) or, as some say, تبذير means the “ exceeding in respect of the right objects of expenditure,” which is ignorance of the [right] manner,

signifies the expending otherwise than in obedience of God, (Sufyán, K, * TA,) whether little or
much; (TA;) as also ↓ سَرَفٌ: (M, TA:) it is
also said to mean the eating that which it is not
lawful to eat; and this is said to be meant in
the Kur vi. 142 or vii. 29: and the putting a
thing in a wrong place [as when one expends
his money upon a wrong object]: and accord. to
Iyás Ibn-Mo'áwiyeh, الإِسْرَافُ is that [action]
whereby one falls short of what is due to God.
(TA.) You say also, اسرف فِى مَالِهِ, meaning

Kur xvii. 35, is said to mean The slaying of
another than the slayer of one's companion:
(Zj, M, Mgh: *) or the slaying the slayer without
the authority of the Sultán: or the not being
content with slaying one, but slaying a number
of persons, because of the high rank of the slain
and the low condition of the slayer: or the slaying one higher in rank than the slayer: (Zj, M:)
or the slaying two when the slayer is one: or the
maining or mutilating [before slaughter]. (Mgh.)
إِسْرَافٌ also signifies The committing of many
faults, offences, or crimes, and sins. (TA.) And
you say, أَكَلَهُ إِسْرَافًا (TA) and ↓ سَرَفًا, (M, TA,)

watering-trough, or tank, [went away running to
waste, or] overflowed from its sides: (K, TA:)
or سَرَفُ المَآءِ means (assumed tropical:)  what goes, of water, without
irrigating and without profit: [or rather its
going for nought:] you say, أَرْوَتِ البِئْرُ النَّخِيلَ
وَذَهَبَ بَقِيَّةُ المَآءِ سَرَفًا (assumed tropical:)  [The well irrigated the palmtrees, and the rest of the water went for nought,
in waste]. (Sh, TA.) ―
-b4-  And Addictedness
(ضَرَاوَةٌ, S, K, or لَهَجٌ M) to a thing, (M,) or in
respect of wine. (K, TA.) It is said in a trad.
(S, M) of 'Áïsheh, (TA,) إِنَّ لِلَّحْمِ سَرَفًا كَسَرَفِ
الخَمْرِ [Verily there is an addictedness to flesh-meat like the addictedness to wine]: (S, M, TA:)
i. e. he who is accustomed to it is addicted to the
eating thereof, like as he who is constantly drinking wine is addicted thereto, having little selfrestraint therefrom: or the meaning here is unmindfulness [of consequences with respect to flesh-meat &c.]: or corruptness of conduct, arising
from hardness of heart, and daringness to disobey, and self-impulsion to the gratification of
appetite: (TA:) or it may be [that the meaning
is, there is an extravagance with respect to flesh-meat &c.,] from الإِسْرَافُ (S, TA) in expenditure
for that which is not needed, or otherwise than
in obedience [to the law of God]. (TA.) ―
