سَاْتَىَ ساتاهُ, (K,) inf. n. مُسَاتَاةٌ, (TA,) He played
with him the [game called] شَفَلَّقَة [expl. in art.
شفلق in the K as consisting in one's striking with
the hand, or with the fore part of the foot, the
hinder part, or backside, of a man, from behind
him, and so throwing him down prostrate: whence
it seems that the verb is perhaps irregularly derived from the سَتَهَهُ, q. v.]. (K.)

استى الثَّوْبَ (S, K) and ↓ ستّاهُ (M, TA) are
syn. with اسداهُ (S, K) and سدّاهُ, (M, TA,) [i. e.
He set, or disposed, the warp of the garment, or
piece of cloth,] said of a weaver; contr. of أَلْحَمَهُ;

إِسْتَوْتَىَ[accord. to the S and K]. اِسْتَاتَتْ, inf. n.
اِسْتِيتَآءٌ, said of a she-camel, She became relaxed
by reason of last: (S, K:) thus mentioned here
by J and in the K; but its proper place, as is
evident, is art. اتى, in which it has been explained. (TA: see 10 in art. اتى.)
سَتًى is syn. with سَدًى, (S, M, K,) relating to
a garment, or piece of cloth; (S, M;) as also
↓ أُسْتِىٌّ; (K;) both signify [The warp thereof;]
the contr. of لُحْمَةٌ; like سَدًى and أُسْدِىٌّ: (M:)
and ↓ سَتَاةٌ is [the n. un. of the former, or] syn.
with سَدَاةٌ, relating to a garment, or piece of
cloth: (AZ, S:) [whence,] one says to him who
neither harms nor profits, ↓ مَا أَنْتَ لُحْمَةٌ وَ لَا سَتَاةٌ
[lit. Thou art neither a woof nor a warp: see
also a similar saying voce نِيرٌ]: (TA: [see also
سَدًى:]) and ↓ أُسْتِىٌّ signifies also ثَوْبٌ مُسْدًى or
مُسَدًّى (accord. to different copies of the K) [lit.
a garment, or piece of cloth, having its warp set
or disposed; perhaps meaning having a good, or
strong, warp; in art. اسد written, as from the
L, مَسْدِىٌّ, for which I find no other authority];
so expl. by AHeyth: but accord. to others, it is
what the weavers term سَتًى, as mentioned above,
i. e. the warp. (TA. [See also أُسْتِىٌّ in art. است,
and أُسْدِىٌّ in art. اسد and in art. سدو and سدى.])
