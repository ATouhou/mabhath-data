سَكُنَ, (L,)
inf. n. سُكُونٌ, (S, Mgh, L, Msb, K,) said of a
thing, (S, L,) of a thing that moves, (Mgh, Msb,)
It was, or became, still, motionless, stationary, in
a state of rest, quiet, calm, or unruffled, (هَدَأَ,
Abu-l-'Abbás, L, or قَرَّ, K,) after motion; (Abu-l-'Abbás, L;) its motion [ceased, or] went away;
(L, Msb;) and in like manner said of a man, and

like; of rain; [and of pain;] and of anger;
[&c.;] it was, or became, still, calm, tranquillized, appeased, allayed, assuaged, or quelled; [it
died away, passed away, or ceased to be: and it
remitted, or subsided; became alleviated, light,
slight, or gentle:] and said of a man [or beast or
the like, and of a voice or sound], he [or it] was,
or became, still, or silent. (L.) [Hence,] one
says, سَكَنَ الدَّمْعُ, and الدَّمُ, meaning رَقَأَ [The
tears, and the blood, stopped, or ceased to flow].
(S and Mgh in art. رقاٌ.) [And one says of heat,
and cold, and pain, &c., سَكَنَ عَنْهُ It passed away
from him; quitted him. And سَكَنَتِ النَّارُ The
fire became extinguished; or became allayed or
assuaged; subsided; or ceased to flame or blaze
or burn fiercely,] ―
-b2-  [Hence also, It (a letter)
was or became, quiescent; i. e., without a vowel
immediately following it; contr. of تَحَرَّكَ.] ―
-b3-
And سَكَنَ إِلَيْهِ, (Msb, [where the aor. is said to
be
سَكِنَ, but this is either a mistake or rare, for the
aor. accord. to common usage is
سَكُنَ, as in the Kur
vii.] 189 and xxx. 20,]) inf. n. سُكُونٌ (Mgh, Msb)
and سَكَنٌ, (Msb,) He trusted to it, or relied upon
it, so as to be, or become, easy, or quiet, in mind;
i. q. رَكَنَ إِلَيْهِ; (S and K &c. in art. ركن;) and
اِطْمَأَنَّ إِلَيْهِ; (TA in art. طمن;) [and اِعْتَمَدَ عَلَيْهِ;
and وَثِقَ بِهِ; &c.; and he inclined to it; syn.
مَالَ إِلَيْهِ; and became familiar with it; syn.

here following;] namely, a thing: (Msb:) and
سَكَنَ إِلَيْهَا, aor.
سَكُنَ, he trusted to her, or relied upon
her, so as to be, or become, easy, or quiet, in
mind; &c., as above; syn. اِطْمَأَنَّ إِلَيْهَا; (Ksh
and Bd in vii. 189, and Ksh in xxx. 20;) and
مَالَ إِلَيْهَا; (Ksh in vii. 189, and the same and
Bd in xxx. 20;) and اِسْتَأْنَسَ بِهَا, and أَلِفَ; (Bd
in the same two places;) namely, his wife. (Ksh
and Bd.) ―
-b4-  And سَكَنَ الَّدارَ, (S, MA, Mgh, L,
Msb, K,) and فِى الدَّارِ, (Mgh, Msb,) and بِالمَكَانِ,
(L,) aor.
سَكُنَ, (L, Msb, JM,) inf. n. سُكْنَى (MA,
Mgh, L, JM) and سُكُونٌ (MA, L) and سُكْنٌ,
(MA,) or ↓ سُكْنَى is a simple subst., and the
inf. n. is سكن, (Msb, [accord. to which the latter
is app. سَكَنٌ, for it is there said that the verb in
this case is like طَلَبَ, the unaugmented inf. n. of
which is طَلَبٌ, but this inf. n. سَكَنُ I have not
found elsewhere, and what is generally used as
the inf. n. or quasi-inf. n. of the verb in this case
is ↓ سُكْنَى,]) or ↓ سُكْنَى is a subst. in the sense of
إِسْكَانٌ, as expl. below, (Mgh,) [or rather it is also
a subst. in this sense,] He inhabited, or dwelt or
abode in, the house [and the place]. (MA, Mgh.)
وَلَهُ مَا سَكَنَ فِى اللَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ, in the Kur [vi. 13],
is from السُّكْنَى (Ksh, Bd) or from السُّكُونُ: (Bd:)
if from the former, (Ksh, Bd,) it signifies To
Him belongeth what taketh up its abode in the
night and the day; (IAar, Ksh, * Bd, * L, Jel;)
meaning, what the night and the day include
within their limits: (Ksh, * Bd:) or, if from
السُّكُونُ, (Bd,) what is still, or motionless, (Abu-l-'Abbás, Bd, L,) and what moves; one of the
two contraries being mentioned as sufficient [to
show what is intended] without the other; (Bd;)
app. meaning the creation, collectively, or all
created beings. (Abu-l-'Abbás, L.) ―
-b5-  And سَكَنَ,
(L, K,) aor.
سَكُنَ, (K,) He became such as is termed
مِسْكِين [q. v.]; (L, K;) as also سَكُنَ, (K,) and
↓ اسكن, and ↓ تسكّن, and ↓ تَمَسْكَنَ: (L, K:) and
[thus it means particularly] he was, or became,
lowly, humble, or submissive; and low, abject,
abased, and weak; as also ↓ اسكن, (L,) and
↓ تسكّن, and ↓ تَمَسْكَنَ; (S, * L;) the former of
these being the regular form, (S, L,) and the
more common and more chaste; (L;) the latter
of them anomalous, [from المِسْكِينُ,] like تَمَنْدَلَ
from المِنْدِيلُ, and تَمَدْرَعَ from المِدْرَعَةُ; (S, L;)
and ↓ استكن, (L, Msb,) and ↓ اِسْتَكَانَ, of the
measure اِفْتَعَلَ (L, Msb, K) from المَسْكَنَةُ (L, K)
or from السُّكُونُ, (Msb,) with ا added, (L, Msb,)
the vowel of the medial radical letter being thus
rendered full in sound, (L, Msb, K,) or it is of
the measure اِسْتَفْعَلَ from الكِينَةُ, signifying “ evil
state or condition,” (Msb,) or from الكَيْنُ signifying “ the [piece of] flesh in the interior of the
vulva,” because he who is lowly and abject is the
most obscure of mankind. (L. [See also arts.
كون and كين.])
2
سكّنهُ, (S, L, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَسْكِينٌ, (S, L,
K,) He, or it, caused it to be, or become, still,
motionless, stationary, in a state of rest, quiet,
calm, or unruffled; (S, * L, Msb, K;) namely, a
thing: (S, L, Msb:) [and caused it, namely,
anything such as wind, and heat, and cold, and
the like, as rain, and pain, and anger, to be, or
become, still, or calm; stilled, calmed, tranquillized, appeased, allayed, assuaged, or quelled, it;
caused it to die away, pass away, or cease to be:
and caused it to remit, or subside; to become
alleviated, light, slight, or gentle: and caused
him, and it, namely, a man or beast or the like,
and a voice or sound, to become still, or silent:
(see 1, first sentence:)] and ↓ اسكنهُ signifies the
same. (L.) [Hence,] one says of God, سكّن
دَمْعَهُ, meaning أَرْقَأَهُ [He caused his tears to stop,
or cease flowing]. (S and TA in art. رقأ.) ―
-b2-  [And
hence, He made it (a letter) quiescent; i. e., made
it to be without a vowel immediately following
it; contr. of حَرَّكَهُ.]
-A2-  تَسْكِينٌ also signifies The
straightening a cane, or spear, (صَعْدَة,) with fire

(TA in art. جور.)
4

-A2-  اسكنهُ: see 2, first sentence. ―
-b2-  [Hence,] said
of poverty, It made him to be little, or seldom, in
motion. (Aboo-Is-hák, L, K.) ―
-b3-  And, said of
God, He made him to be such as is termed
مِسْكِين [q. v.]. (L, K.) ―
-b4-  And اسكنهُ الدَّارَ, (S, L,
Msb, K,) or المَنْزِلَ, (MA,) He made him [or
gave him] to inhabit the house, or abode; (S, *
MA, L, * Msb, * K; *) he lodged him therein.
(MA.)
5
تسكّن, said of a man, is from السَّكِينَةُ [i. e.
He had, or possessed, or affected, the quality thus
termed; meaning he was, or became, or affected
to be, calm, tranquil, grave, staid, steady, or
sedate; &c.]. (L.) See also Q. Q. 2, below:

Q. Q. 2

imitated, such as are termed مَسَاكِين [pl. of
مِسْكِينٌ, q. v.]. (IAth, L.) ―

the end, in two places. You say, تَمَسْكَنَ لِرَبِهِ
He humbled, or abased, himself to his Lord; or
addressed himself with earnest, or energetic, supplication to Him: and ↓ تسكّن is like تَمَسْكَنَ.
(Lh, L.)
سَكْنٌ, a quasi-pl. n. of ↓ سَاكِنٌ, like as شَرْبٌ is
of شَارِبٌ, called by Akh a pl., (L,) The inhabitants, people, or family, of a house or tent; (S,
L, K;) a household. (L.) ―
-b2-  And The collective
body of the people of a tribe: one says, تَحَمَّلَ
السَّكْنُ فَذَهَبُوا [The collective body of the people
of the tribe bound the loads, or burdens, upon
their beasts, and went away]. (Lh, L.) ―
-b3-  See
also سَكَنٌ. ―
-b4-  And see the paragraph here next
following.
سُكْنٌ: see سُكْنَى. ―
-b2-  And see also مَسْكَنٌ, in
three places. ―
-b3-  Also, (L, JM, [thus written in
both, and expressly said in the latter to be “ with
damm,”]) or ↓ سَكَنٌ, (thus in copies of the K,)
or ↓ سَكْنٌ, (thus in the CK,) [but the first is app.
the right,] Food, aliment, or victuals, syn. قُوتٌ;
(L, K, JM;) like نُزْلٌ meaning “ food (طَعَام, L,
JM) of a party alighting to partake of it,” and
said to be called سُكْنٌ because by means of it a
place is inhabited, like as the نُزْل of an army
means the “ appointed rations of an army alighting
at a place. ” (L.)
سَكَنٌ A thing, (S, L, Msb, K,) of any kind,
(S, L,) to which one trusts, or upon which one
relies, so as to be, or become, easy, or quiet, in
mind; (S, L, Msb, K;) and in like manner, a
person, or persons, to whom one trusts, &c.:
applied in this sense to a family, or wife, (L,
Msb,) as well as to property, (Msb,) &c.: (L,
Msb:) and hence [particularly] signifying a
wife. (L.) One says, [app. using it in this sense,
as seems to be indicated by the context in the S,]
فُلَانٌ أْبْنُ السَّكَنِ [Such a one is the son of the
سَكَن]; and As used to say ↓ السَّكْنِ: (S, L:)
accord. to Ibn-Habeeb, one says سَكَن and سَكْن.
(L.) And it is said in the Kur [vi. 96], جَعَلَ
أْللَّيْلَ سَكَنًا He hath made, or appointed, the
night to be a resource for ease, or quiet. (L.)
And in the same [ix. 104], إِنَّ صَلَوَاتِكَ سَكَنٌ لَهُمْ,
i. e. [Verily thy prayers for forgiveness are] a cause
of ease, or quiet, to them. (Zj, L.) [And ↓ سُكْنَةٌ
seems to have a similar meaning: for] ISh says,
تَغْطِيَةُ الوَجْهِ عِنْدَ النَّوْمِ سُكْنَةٌ, app. [The covering
of the face on the occasion of sleep is a cause of
ease, or quiet,] in the case of loneliness, or of fear
arising therefrom. (L.) And it is said in a trad.,
اَللّٰهُمَّ أَنْزِلْ عَلَيْنَا فِى أَرْضِنا سَكَنَهَا, meaning O God,
send down upon us, in our land, the succour, or
relief, of its inhabitants, [app. alluding to rain,]
to which they may trust so as to be easy, or quiet,
in mind. (L.) ―

a cause of ease, or comfort;] (S, L, K;) as in the
saying [of a rájiz],
وَسَكَنٍ تُوقَدُ فِىمِظَلَّهْ
[And a fire kindled in a large tent of hair-cloth,
or in a booth, or shed], (S, L,) describing himself
as driven to have recourse thereto by the night,
and by a moist wind, or a wind cold with
moisture; and [afterwards used without any
allusion to its being a cause of ease, or comfort,]
as in the saying of another, describing a cane,
أَقَامَهَا بِسَكَنٍ وَأَدْهَانْ
meaning He straightened it with fire and oils.
(L.) ―

سَكِنَةٌ A place; [properly] a place of habitation
or abode: pl. سَكِنَاتٌ. (L.) It is said in a trad.,
اِسْتَقِرُّوا عَلَى سَكِنَاتِكُمْ فَقَدِ انْقَطَعَتِ الهِجْرَةُ, (S, L,
K, *) i. e. Rest ye, or remain ye, at your places,
(S, L,) or in your places of habitation or abode,
(S, L, K,) for emigration has [ended, having]
become no longer needful. (L.) And one says,
النَّاسُ عَلَى سَكِنَاتِهِمْ, [virtually] meaning, accord.
to Fr, The people are in their right state: (S,
L:) and in like manner is expl. the saying,
تَرَكْتُهُمْ عَلَى سَكِنَاتِهِمْ and ↓ سَكَنَاتِهِمْ and نَزَلَاتِهِمْ;
but the approved explanation is, [I left them] at
their places of habitation, which is that of Th;
or, as in the M, their places of alighting, or
abode. (L.) ―
-b2-  Also The part, of the neck, which
is the resting-place of the head. (S, L, K.) So in
the saying, (S, L,) attributed to several poets, (L,)
بِضَرْبِ يُزِيلُ الهَامَ عَنْ سَكِنَاتِهِ
[With a smiting that removes the heads from
their resting-places on the necks]. (S, L.)
سُكْنَى is an inf. n. of سَكَنَ in the phrase سَكَنَ
الدَّارَ: (MA, Mgh, L, JM:) or a simple subst.
therefrom: (Msb:) or a subst. in the sense of

see 1, in three places: or it is a subst. (S, L, K)
also (L) from أَسْكَنَهُ الدَّارَ, (S, L, K,) like as عُتْبَى
is from إِعْتَابٌ, (S, L,) and so is ↓ سَكَنٌ, (Lh, L,
K,) [which is app. mentioned in the Msb as an
inf. n. of the former verb,] signifying, as also
↓ سُكْنٌ, [so in one place, as on the authority of
Lth, in the L, and said in the MA to be, like
سُكْنَى, an inf. n. of the verb first mentioned above,]
The making [or giving] a man a place, or an
abode, to inhabit, without rent; (L, and Ham
p. 400 in explanation of the first of these words;)
the term سُكْنَى being similar to عُمْرَى. (L.) ―
-b2-
See also مَسْكَنٌ, in five places.
سُكَيْنٌ An ass light, or active, and quick, or
swift: and سُكَيْنَةٌ is applied to a she-ass (L, K)
in the same sense. (L.) ―
-b2-  Hence the latter is

spirit. (L.) ―
-b3-  The former also signifies A wild
ass. (L.) ―

(Har p. 62.) One says of a man who is calm or
tranquil, or grave &c., عَلَيْهِ السَّكِينَةُ [Upon him is
resting, or abiding, calmness &c.]. (L.) And it
is said in a trad., respecting the Prophet, on the
occasion of the coming down of revelation,
فَغَشِيَتْهُ السَّكِينَةُ, meaning And calmness, or tranquillity, and غَيْبَة [i. e., as here used, absence of
mind from self and others by its being exclusively
occupied by the contemplation of divine things],
came upon him. (L.) And in the Kur [ii. 249],
it is said, [with reference to the coming of the
ark of the covenant,] فِيهِ سَكِينَةٌ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ, meaning
[In which shall be] a cause of your becoming
tranquil, [or easy in your minds,] when it cometh to
you [from your Lord]: (Zj, L, K:) or, as some say,
there was in it a head like that of the cat; when
it uttered a cry, victory betided the Children of
Israel: (L:) or a thing having a head like that
of the cat [and a tail like that of the cat (Bd)],
of chrysolite and sapphire, and a pair of wings:
(L, K:) or an image like the cat, that was with

of the Prophets, from Adam to Mohammad:
(Bd:) or the signs, or miracles, with the performance of which Moses was endowed, and to
which they trusted so as to be easy, or quiet, in
their minds: (L:) or by the تَابُوت to which these
words refer is meant the heart, [or rather the
chest, i. e. bosom,] and the سكينة is the knowledge,
and purity, or sincerity, in the heart [or bosom].
(Bd.) In a trad. of' Alee, respecting the building.
of the Kaabeh, it is said, فَأَرْسَلَ اللّٰه إِلَيْهِ السَّكِينَةَ,

L, K, *) pl. of سِكِينٌ; (ISd, L;) as also ↓ سَكَاكِينِىٌّ,

سُكَّانٌ The ذَنَب, (Lth, S, MA, Mgh, L,) [i. e.]
the rudder, (MA, KL, PS,) of a ship or boat,

خَيْزُرَانٌ and كَوْثَلٌ [meaning the same, or its

(L;) as also ↓ سِكِّينَةٌ, (ISd, L, K,) a dial. var.,

because it stills the animals slaughtered with it:
(Az, L, Msb:) of the measure فِعِّيلٌ: (IDrd, L,
Msb:) or, accord. to some, its ن is augmentative,
so that it is of the measure فِعْلِينٌ: (Msb:) it is
masc., and sometimes fem.: (Zj, IAmb, * L, Msb,
K: *) not heard as fem. by IAar: (L:) held to
be only masc. by AZ and As and some others:
(Msb:) but sometimes it occurs in poetry as fem.
on the ground of meaning [as being syn. with
مُدْيَةٌ or شَفْرَهٌ], (Msb,) and as such it occurs in a
trad.: (L:) the pl. is سَكَاكِينُ. (ISd, MA, L.)

↓ سُكْنَى, (Lh, L,) and ↓ سُكْنٌ: you say, دَارٌ فِيهَا
↓ سَكَنٌ and ↓ سُكْنٌ, i. e. ↓ سُكْنَى [or مَسْكَنٌ, meaning A house in which is a place of habitation, or
a lodging]: (L: [↓ سَكَنٌ and ↓ سُكْنٌ are there
mentioned as syn., each of them, with مَسْكَنٌ and
سُكْنَى, but in different places; and I incline to
think that سُكْنٌ thus mentioned may be a mistranscription for سَكَنٌ: I have not found it elsewhere in this sense:]) and ↓ دَارِى لَكَ سُكْنَى, in
which the last word is [said to be] virtually in
the accus. case, as a denotative of state, meaning
[My house is for thee,] as made [or given] to be
inhabited, or as being inhabited: (Mgh:) or
↓ لَكَ دَارِى هٰذِهِ سُكْنَى, meaning To thee this my
house is a lent dwelling-place: and المَرْأَةِ ↓ سُكْنَى
means The wife's dwelling-place in which the
husband lodges her. (L.)
مَرْعًى مُسْكِنٌ Abundant pasturage, [that causes
people to abide in it,] not requiring to go away;
like مُرْبِعٌ and مُنْرِلٌ. (L.) ―
-b2-  أَصْبَحُوا مُسْكِنِينَ
They became in the state termed مَسْكَنَةٌ. (L, K.)
مَسْكَنَةٌ (L, Msb, K) The state of him who is
termed مِسْكِينٌ: primarily, lowliness, humility, or
submissiveness: and meaning also lowness, abjectness, ignominiousness, abasement, or humiliation;
and paucity of property; and an evil state or
condition; also poverty of mind; and weakness;
(IAth, L:) it is from السُّكُونُ [an inf. n. of سَكَنَ
meaning as expl. in the first sentence of this
art.]. (L.)
مُسْكَانٌ, meaning “ an earnest,” or “ earnest
money,” and of which [as well as of مِسْكِينٌ] the
pl. is مَسَاكِينُ, belongs to art. مسك. (TA.)
مِسْكِينٌ (S, Mgh, L, Msb, K, &c.) and مَسْكِينٌ,
(L, Msb, K,) the latter anomalous, for there is no
[other] instance of the measure مَفْعِيلٌ, (L,) of
the dial. of Benoo-Asad, (L, Msb,) mentioned by
Ks as heard by him from some one or more of
that tribe, (L,) others saying مِسْكِينٌ, (Msb,) of
the measure مِفْعِيلٌ (L) from السُّكُونُ, because the
person to whom it is applied trusts to, or relies
upon, others, so as to be, or become, easy, or
quiet, in mind: (Mgh, L, Msb:) primarily, (L,)
it signifies Lowly, humble, or submissive; (IAth,
Mgh, L;) and therefore the Prophet said, اَللّٰهُمَّ
أَحْيِنِى مِسْكِينًا وَأَمِتْنِى مِسْكِينًا وَاْحْشُرْنِى فِى زُمْرَةِ
المَسَاكِينِ [O God, make me to live lowly, and
make me to die lowly, and gather me among the
congregation of the lowly]: (Mgh, * L:) and
hence it sometimes applies to him who possesses
little and [sometimes] to him who possesses much:
(L:) sometimes, (S,) it signifies (S, IAth, L,
Msb, K) also (IAth, L) low, abject, ignominious,
or in a state of abasement or humiliation; (S,
IAth, L, Msb, K;) and weak; (S, L, K;) and
subdued, or oppressed; though possessing riches
or competence: (Msb:) [therefore] Sb says, it is
one of the words expressive of pity, or compassion; [and as such may be rendered poor;]
you say, مَرَرْت بِهِ المِسْكِينَ [I passed by him, I
mean the poor man], putting it in the accus. case
by the implication of أَعْنِى, though it may be in
the genitive case as a substitute [for the pronoun], and in the nom. case by the suppression
of هُوَ meant to be understood: (L:) in other
cases, (S,) it is syn. with فَقِيرٌ, (S, L, Msb,)
meaning (Msb) destitute, i. e. possessing nothing:
(L, Msb, K:) or accord. to ISk, مسكين means
thus; but the فقير is he who possesses a sufficiency of the means of subsistence: (Msb:) or
the former means possessing somewhat; (L;) or
[rather] needy, i. e. possessing what is not sufficient (L, K) for him (K) or for his family:
(L:) or caused by poverty to have little power of
motion; (L, K;) thus expl. by Aboo-Is-hák;
but this is improbable; for مسكين has the meaning of an active part. n., and his explanation
[like one of the others mentioned above] makes it to
have that of a pass. part. n.: (L:) Yoo says the
like of ISk: (Msb:) he used to say that the
مسكين is in a harder condition than the فقير: (S,
L, * Msb: *) he says, I asked an Arab of the
desert, Art thou فقير? and he answered, No, by
God, but rather مسكين; (S, L, * Msb;) but
'Alee Ibn-Hamzeh says that this man may have
meant that he was low, or abject, by reason of his
distance from his people and his home; and that
he does not think he meant anything but that:
(L:) [J also adds,] it is said in a trad. that the
مسكين is not he whom a mouthful or two mouthfuls will turn back, or away, but is only he who
does not beg, and who is not known so that he
may be given [anything]; (S;) but Ziyádet-Allah
Ibn-Ahmad says that the فقير is he who sits in
his house, not begging, and the مسكين is he who
begs and is given; and hence it is argued that
the latter is in a better condition than the former;
though it indicates that the former is more highminded than the latter: (L:) accord. to As, the
مسكين is better in condition than the فقير; and
this is [said to be] the right assertion, (Mgh, L,
Msb,) for the pl. of the former is applied in the
Kur xviii. 78 to men possessing a ship, or boat,
which is worth a considerable sum; (L, Msb;)
but they may have been thus termed because
they were humbled and abased by the tyranny
of the king who took every ship, or boat, that he
found upon the sea, by force; (L;) and it is said
that these men were hirers, not owners, of the
vessel: (TA voce فَقِيرٌ, q. v.:) 'Alee Ibn-Hamzeh
says, that the مسكين is better in condition than
the فقير is shown by a passage in the Kur
[ix. 60], where it is said that the poor-rates are
for the فُقَرَآء and the مَسَاكِين; for you will find
the classes to be there mentioned in such an order
that the second is better in condition than the
first, and the third than the second, and in like
manner the fourth and the fifth and the sixth and
the seventh and the eighth: and he says that the
same is shown by the fact that the Arabs sometimes used مسكين as a proper name, but not
فقير: (L:) or when these two words are used
together, they differ in signification; and when
used separately, they [sometimes] signify the
same: (El-Bedr El-Karáfee, TA in art. فقر:)
[see more voce فَقِيرٌ:] a woman is termed مِسْكِينَةٌ
(Sb, S, L, Msb, K) and مِسْكِينٌ also; (S, L, K;)
the former by way of assimilation to فَقِيرَةٌ; (Sb,
S, L;) the latter being accord. to rule, for an
epithet of the measure مِفْعِيلٌ is regularly applied
alike to a male and a female; (S, Msb;) or, as
Abu-l-Hasan says, this is only when it is an
intensive epithet, which مِسْكِينَةٌ is not: (L:) the
pl. is مَسَاكِينُ and مِسْكِينُونَ, (S, L, K,) applied
to men, (K,) or to a company of people, (S, L,)
and مِسْكِينَاتٌ applied to female. (S, L, K.)
