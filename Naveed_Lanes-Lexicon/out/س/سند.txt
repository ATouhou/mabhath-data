الأَسْنَادُ مِنَ الثِّيَابِ, i. e. garments of those called
بُرُود: and he cites, from a poet, the phrase جُبَّةُ

transmitted: (KT:) pl. مَسَانِدُ, (K,) agreeably
with analogy, (TA,) and مَسَانِيدُ, (Esh-Sháfi'ee,
K,) which latter has ى added to render the sound

half of the second century of the Flight and the
former half of the third century]: (M, TA:)
Abu-l-'Abbás says, المُسْنَدُ was the language of
the sons of Seth; (O, TA;) [i. e. the language
written in the character so called;] and the like is
said in the “ Sirr es-Siná'ah ” of IJ. (TA.) [See

come to him or it,] ever. (IAar, TA.)

or whose frame, or make, is symmetrical, or conformable in its several parts: or, as some say,

phrase تَسَانَدَ القَوْمُ meaning as expl. above [see 6]:
