سَهْبٌ The act of taking. (JK, K.) You
say, سَهَبَ الشَّىْءَ, aor.
سَهَبَ, inf. n. سَهْبٌ, He took the
thing. (TK.)
2
تَسْهِيبٌ The departure of reason, or intellect:
its verb [which was probably سُهِّبَ, like أُسْهِبَ,
q. v.,] is obsolete. (TA.)
4
اسهب He went far, or to a great or an
extraordinary length, in a thing; for instance, in
journeying; as in a trad., in which it is said of
horses, or horsemen, أَسْبَهَتْ شَهْرًا They went far
for a month; and in eating and drinking; as in
another trad.: (TA:) it is from سُهْبٌ, signifying
“ a plain and far-extending land; ” as though
meaning He traversed a plain and far-extending
tract of land; like as one says أَسْهَلَ and أَحْزَنَ.
(Har p. 572.) He (a horse) ran with wide steps,
and preceded, or outstripped. (S, TA. [See also
سَهْبٌ, below.]) And [hence,] He was, or became,
loquacious, or profuse of speech; (IAar, S, K;)
like اسهم; (K * and TA in art. سهم;) [and] so
اسهب فِى المَنْطِقِ : (JK:) or he doted; or was
disordered in his intellect; but when a man
makes many mistakes in his speech, you say of
him أَفْنَدَ: (As, TA:) or he doted much, or
often; or was much, or often, disordered in his
intellect: (AO, TA:) [and it seems from an explanation of the part. n. مُسْهِبٌ that it probably
signifies also he was eloquent, or profuse of correct speech:] or he was very greedy, and (in
some copies of the K “ or ”) covetous, so as to
refrain from nothing: (K, TA:) and you say
also اسهب كَلَامَهُ He prolonged, or was prolix
in, his speech: and فى كَلَامِهِ إِسْهَابٌ In his
speech is prolixity. (A, TA.) Also He (a man)
gave much, or largely; and so ↓ استهب: (Lth,
K:) [or, in this sense,] you say, اسهب فِى العَطَآء.

-b2-  اسهبوا They reached sand, in digging [a
well], and water came not forth: (S:) or they
dug, and came upon sand or a current of air:
(K:) or they dug, and came upon a current of
air, and the water disappointed them of its

became altered in consequence of love or fright or
disease: (K:) or, accord. to AHát, اسهب, [so in
the TA, in which it seems to be implied that
أَسْهَبَ, not أُسْهِبَ, is meant,] inf. n. إِسْهَابٌ, signifies he (a man bitten by a serpent, or stung by a
scorpion,) lost his reason and lived. (TA. [See
also the part. n., مُسْهَبٌ, below.]) إِسْهَابُ اللُّبِّ

of أُسْهِبَ, not of أَسْهَبَ,] means The mind's being
confounded, or perplexed, by [love of] a woman.

a well that people dig until they reach pouring
earth, which baffles them by its pouring down, so
that they leave it; (Sh, TA;) or a well of which

applied to a horse that is fleet, or swift, and excellent: (TA:) or the former signifies doting;
or disordered in his intellect: (As, TA:) or
doting much, or often; or much, or often, disordered in his intellect: (AO, TA:) [and similar
explanations of it will be found below:] other

sense of the measure مُفْعِلٌ are أَلْفَجَ and أَحْصَنَ
and أَجْرَشَتِ الإِبِلُ and أَهْتَرَ: as used in the first of
the senses expl. in this sentence, مُسْهَبٌ is from
سُهْبٌ signifying “ a wide land: ” or, as some say,

الجِسْمِ A man whose body is wasting away in
consequence of love: so says Yaakoob: and Lh
mentions the phrases العَقْلِ ↓ مُسْهِبُ, with kesr,
and الجِسْمِ, and مُسْهِم, which is formed by substitution [of م for ب], as meaning a man whose
reason is departing, and whose body is wasting
away, in consequence of love: and accord, to
AHát, مسهب, [app. ↓ مُسْهِبٌ, as the context seems
to imply,] applied to one bitten by a serpent or
stung by a scorpion, signifies who has lost his
reason, and lives. (TA.) ―
