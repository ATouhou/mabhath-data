(Fr, L.) ―
-b7-  [Hence,] سَنَّنِى هٰذَا الشَّىْءُ (assumed tropical:)  This thing
[sharpened my appetite;] made me desirous of

الإِبِلَ عَلَى الخُلَّةِ (assumed tropical:)  The [plants, or trees, called]
حمض strengthen the camels [or sharpen their
appetites] for the [plants, or trees, called] خلّة,

L:) you say, سَنَنْتُ النَّاقَةَ I made the she-camel

inf. n. as above, (M, L,) He pursued [a way,
course, rule, mode, or manner, of acting or conduct or life or the like]; as also ↓ استنّها; (M, L;)
or ↓ استسنّها; (so in the K;) and بِهَا ↓ استنّ: (K in
art. سير:) and بِطَرِيقٍ مِنَ الخَيْرِ ↓ استسنّوا [They
followed, or pursued, a good, or pious, way of
acting]. (L.) It is said in a trad. respecting the
Magians, أَهْلِ الكِتَابِ ↓ سُنُّوا بِهِمْ سُنَّةَ, i. e. Pursue
ye with them the way of the People of the
Scripture, or Bible; act with them as ye act
with these; granting them security on the condition of receiving [from them] the [tax called]
جِزْيَة. (Mgh, L. *)
-A2-  سُنَّ is also expl. as meaning He, or it, became altered for the worse, or
stinking: so in a trad. of Barwaa the daughter of
Wáshik, where it is said, كَانَ زَوْجُهَا سُنَّ فِى بِئْرٍ
[Her husband had become altered for the worse,
or stinking, having died, in a well which he had
descended]: from the saying in the Kur مِنْ حَمَأ
مَسْنُونٍ: [see مَسْنُونٌ:] but some say that he [who
used this phrase] meant [to say, or meant thereby,] أَسِنَ, i. e. his head became affected with
vertigo by reason of a foul odour that he smelt,
and he swooned. (L.)
2
سنّنهُ: see 1, near the beginning. ―
-b2-  [Hence,]
سنّن المَنْطِقَ (assumed tropical:)  He made the speech good, or beautiful; (M, L, K;) as though he polished it. (M,
L.) ―
-b3-  And سنّن إِلَيْهِ الرُّمْحَ, (M, L, K,) inf. n.
تَسْنِينٌ, (M, L,) He directed, or pointed, the
spear towards him, or it. (M, L, K.)
3
سانّ النَّاقَةَ, inf. n. مُسَانَّةٌ and سِنَانٌ, (S, M, L,
K,) He (the stallion-camel) bit the she-camel
with the fore part of the mouth: (L:) or he
opposed himself to her, (M, L,) or drove her, (S,
L,) or bit her with the fore part of the mouth,
and drove her, (K,) to make her lie down, (S, M,
L, K,) in order that he might cover her: (S, M, *
L, K:) or he covered her without her desiring it,
or before she desired it, by force. (IB, L.)
4
اسنّ, (S, M, L, Msb, K,) inf. n. إِسْنَانٌ,
(Mgh, L, Msb,) said of a man, (S, M, L, Msb,
K,) and of other than man, (Msb,) i. q. كَبِرَ
[meaning He became advanced in age, or fullgrown], (S, L, Msb,) or كَبِرَتْ سِنُّهُ [which means
the same]; (M, L, K;) as also ↓ استسنّ: (K:)
but Az says that الإِسْنَانُ in the case of an animal
of the ox-kind and of the sheep or goat, is not the
same as in that of a man: for in such animals it
means [the attaining to the age of] the coming
forth of the [permanent] ثَنِيَّة [or central incisor]:
(Msb:) or in such animals it means at least [the
attaining to the age of] the shedding of the [tooth
called] ثنيّة [which is generally said to be in the
third year]; and at the utmost in such animals,
[the attaining to the age of] what is termed
الصُّلُوغ or السُّلُوغ [which is in the sixth year];
and at the utmost in camels, [the attaining to the
age of] what is termed البُزُول [which is generally
in the ninth year]. (Mgh, L.) [It is also expl.
in the K as meaning His tooth grew forth: but
the right explanation is one given in the Mgh
and L; i. e. his tooth whereby he became مَسِنّ
grew forth.] لَمْ يُسْنَنْ, occurring in a trad. of
Ibn-'Omar, as some relate it, is a mistake for
لَمْ يُسْنِنْ. (Mgh, L.) And البَدَنَةُ ↓ سُنَّتِ, a phrase
mentioned by Kt, as meaning The teeth of the
بدنة grew forth, is also a mistake [for أَسَنَّت].
(L.) ―
-b2-  You say also, اسنّ سَدِيسُ النَّاقَةِ The
[tooth called] سديس of the she-camel grew forth,
i. e. in the eighth year. (S, L.)
-A2-  Also, said of
God, He made a tooth to grow forth. (S, L, K.)
اللّٰهُ ↓ سَنَّهَا, [referring to the teeth of a بَدَنَة,] a
phrase mentioned by Kt, is a mistake [for أَسَنَّهَا].
(L.) ―
-b2-  See also 1, in the former half of the paragraph, in two places.
5
تسنّن بِهِ [He took him, or it, as an exemplar, example, or object to be imitated]. (K voce
قُدْوَةٌ.) ―
-b2-  تسنّن فِى عَدْوِهِ He (a man) went at
random, heedlessly, or in a headlong manner, in
his running; as also ↓ استنّ. (M, L.)
-A2-  See also
5 in art. سنه, last signification.
6
تَسَانَّتِ الفُحُولُ i. q. تَكَادَمَت [meaning The
stallion-camels bit one another with the fore part
of the mouth]. (L, K.)
8
استنّ He rubbed and cleaned his teeth with
the سِوَاك [or piece of stick used for that purpose];
(S, M, L, K;) he made use of the سِوَاك, passing
it over his teeth. (L.) ―
-b2-  And He took, or
seized, with the teeth. (KL.)
-A2-  استنّت العَيْنُ
The eye poured forth its tears. (M, L.) ―
-b2-
استنّ said of the blood of a wound made with a
spear or the like, It issued in a gush. (AZ, L.)
―
-b3-  Said of the سَرَاب [or mirage], It was, or
became, in a state of commotion, went to and
fro, or quivered. (M, L, K.) ―
-b4-  Said of a horse,
i. q. قَمَصَ [app. as meaning He pranced, leaped,
sprang, or bounded]: (S, K:) he frisked; or was
brisk, lively, or sprightly: he ran, in his friskiness, briskness, liveliness, or sprightliness, in one
direction: he ran, by reason of his friskiness,
briskness, liveliness, or sprightliness, a heat, or two
heats, without a rider upon him: (L:) he ran to
and fro, by reason of briskness, liveliness, or
sprightliness: from سَنَّ as signifying “ he poured
forth ” water, and as signifying “ he sharpened ”
iron upon a whetstone. (Har p. 47.) It is said
in a prov., اِسْتَنَّتِ الفِصَالُ حَتَّى القَرْعَى, (S, Meyd,
L,) or الفُصْلَانُ, (Meyd,) i. e. The young weaned
camels leaped, sprang, or bounded; (S * L;) even
those affected with the small pustules called قَرَع;
(Meyd, L;) which are small white pustules, the
remedy for which is salt, and the butter (جُبَاب)
of camels' milk: (Meyd:) when the healthy
young weaned camels do thus, those affected with
such pustules do the like in imitation, but become
disabled from doing it by weakness: the prov. is
applied to the man who introduces himself among
a people, or party, to whom he does not belong:
(L:) or to him who speaks with one before whom
he should not speak by reason of the greatness of
his rank: and some related it differently, saying,
القُرَيْعَى [which is the dim. of القَرْعَى]; (Meyd;)
and القُرْعُ [which is pl. of الأَقْرَعُ, q. v.]: and
some say that استنّت الفِصَالُ signifies the young
weaned camels became fat, or plump, and their
skins became [sleek] like مَسَانّ [or whetstones].
(L.) And it is said in a trad. of 'Omar, رَأَيْتُ
أَبَاهُ يَسْتَنُّ بِسَيْفِهِ كَمَا يَسْتَنُّ الجَمَلُ, meaning [I
saw his father] exulting with briskness, liveliness,
or sprightliness, and brandishing his sword, [like
as the camel exults with briskness, and lashes with
his tail.] (L.) See also 5. ―
-b5-  [Also He took,
held, or followed, the سَنَن, i. e., road, or way, or
main and middle part thereof: and he, or it, was,
or lay, in the way. Hence,] one says, خُذْ مَا اسْتَنَّ,
meaning [Take thou what lies in the way;] what
is easily attainable; what offers itself without
difficulty. (AA, TA voce اِنْتَدَبَ.) ―
-b6-  See also 1,

إِسْتَسْنَ3َ see 4:
-A2-  and see also 1, near the end of
the paragraph, in two places. ―
-b2-  اِسْتَسَنَّتِ الطَّرِيقُ
The road was travelled. (K.)
R. Q. 1
سَنْسَنَتِ الرِّيحُ The wind blew coldly,
or coolly; as also نَسْنَسَت: so in the Nawádir. (L.)
سِنٌّ i. q. ضِرْسٌ [as meaning A tooth; in which
sense this latter word is often used; though it is
frequently restricted to a molar tooth, or to any
of the teeth except the central incisors]: (M, L,
K:) [or, accord. to some, a single tooth; i. e.
one that is not of the double, or molar, kind; as
shown by a description in what follows:] of the
fem. gender: (S, M, L, Msb:) pl. أَسْنَانٌ (S, M,
L, Msb, K) and أَسِنَّةٌ and أَسُنٌّ, (M, L, K,) the
last of these mentioned by Lh, and this and the
second anomalous; (M, L;) or the second is
allowable as pl. of the first of these pls.; (S;) or
it is pl. of the سِنَان of the spear; but may also be
pl. of أَسْنَانٌ as pl. of سِنٌّ applied to herbage upon
which camels pasture, in an instance to be cited
in what follows: (A'Obeyd, T, L:) the vulgar
say إِسْنَان and أُسْنَان, which are wrong: (Msb:)
the أَسْنَان of a human being consist of four ثَنَايَا,
and four رَبَاعِيَات, and four أَنْيَاب, and four نَوَاجِذ,
and sixteen أَضْرَاس: or, as some say, four ثنايا, and
four رباعيات, and four انياب, and four نواجذ, and four
ضَوَاحِك, and twelve أَرْحَآء: (Msb:) or the أَسْنَان
and أَضْرَاس together make up the number of
thirty-two; the ثنابا are four, two above and two
below [in the middle]; next are the رباعيات,
which are four, two above and two below; next
are the انياب, which are four [likewise, two above
and two below]; and next are the اضراس, which
are twenty, on each side five above and five
below; and of these [last] the four that are next
to the انياب are the ضواحك; next to each ناب,
above and below, is a ضَاحِك; next to the ضواحك
are the طَوَاحِن, also called the أَرْحَآء, which are
twelve, on each side [above and below] three;
and next to these are the نواجذ, which are the
last of the teeth in growth, and the last of the
اضراس, on each side of the mouth one above and
one below: (Zj in his “ Khalk el-Insán: ”) the
dim. of سِنٌّ is ↓ سُنَيْنَةٌ, because it is fem. (S.)
One says, لَا آتِيكَ سِنَّ الحِسْلِ, (S, M, L,) i. e. I
will not come to thee as long as remains the tooth
of the young one of the [kind of lizard called]
ضَبّ; (M, L;) meaning, ever; (S, M, * L;)
because the حسل never sheds a tooth: (S, L:)
or, as Lh relates it, on the authority of ElMufaddal, سِنَّىْ حِسْلٍ; [using the dual form of
سِنٌّ;] and [it may be rendered, accord. to the
former reading, (assumed tropical:)  during the life of the young one
of the ضّب, for] he says, they assert that the ضبّ
lives three hundred years, and that it is the
longest-lived creeping thing upon the earth. (M,
L.) A poet (Aboo-Jarwal El-Jushamee, whose
name was Hind, L) says, describing camels taken
as a bloodwit,
فَجَآءَتْ كَسِنِّ الظَّبْىِ لَمْ أَرَ مِثْلَهَا
بَوَآءَ قَتِيلٍ أَوْ حَلُوبَةَ جَائِعِ
[And they came; (assumed tropical:)  like the age of the gazelle was
the age of every one of them: I have not seen
the like of them for an equivalent of a slain
person, or a milch camel of one hungry: (I have
given a reading of this verse that I have found in
the M and TA in art. ظبى, instead of that in the
present art. in the S and L, in which سنآءَ and
سَنَآءَ are put in the place of بَوَآءَ app. for سِنَآءَ, an
inf. n. of سَانَاهُ, and as such here meaning a soothing, or the like:)] he means that they were ثُنْيَان,
[pl. of ثَنِىٌّ], because the ثَنِىّ is one shedding [or
that has shed] his ثَنِيَّة, and the gazelle has no
ثَنِيَّة [in the upper jaw], so that he is always [one
that may be termed] a ثَنِىّ. (S, L.) It is said in
a trad., إِذَا سَافَرْتُمْ فِى الخِصْبِ فَأَعْطُوا الرُّكُبَ
أَسِنَّتَهَا, [expl. as] meaning When ye journey in the
land abounding with herbage, enable ye the ridden
beasts to take of the pasturage: (S, L:) but Az states
that A'Obeyd says, I know not أَسِنَّة except as pl.
of the سِنَان of the spear; and if the trad. be [correctly] preserved in memory, it seems to be pl. of
أَسْنَان; for سِنٌّ [sometimes] signifies the [portion
of] herbage upon which camels pasture; and its
pl. is أَسْنَانٌ; one says, أَسْنَانٌ مِنَ المَرْعَى; and
the pl. of أَسْنَانٌ is أَسِنَّةٌ: Aboo-Sa'eed says that
this last is pl. of سِنَانٌ, not of أَسْنَانٌ, and ↓ سِنَانٌ
is applied to the [plants, or trees, called] حَمْض,
as meaning (assumed tropical:)  a strengthener [i. e. a sharpener of
the appetite] of the camels for the [plants, or
trees, called] خُلَّة: [see a phrase in the earlier
part of the first paragraph:] in like manner, also,
[he says,] when they light upon what is termed
سِنٌّ مِنَ المَرْعَى [a portion of pasturage], this is
termed عَلَى السَّيْرِ ↓ سِنَانٌ [a strengthener, or
sharpener, for journeying]: this explanation is
approved by Az, and likewise that of A'Obeyd:
it is also related, on the authority of Fr, that
السِّنُّ signifies the eating vehemently: [a signification mentioned in the K as well as in the L:]
and Az says, I have heard more than one of the
Arabs say, أَصَابَتِ الإِبِلُ اليَوْمَ سِنًّا مِنَ المَرْعَى
[The camels have obtained to-day a good portion of
pasturage] when they have eaten well of the best of
the pasturage: Z says that ↓ أَعْطُوا الرُّكُبَ أَسِنَّتَهَا
means (assumed tropical:)  Give ye to the ridden beasts what will
prevent their being slaughtered; for when their
owner pastures them well, they become fat, and
goodly in his eye, and therefore he withholds
himself, with niggardliness, from slaughtering
them, and this [condition of them] is likened to
أَسِنَّة [as meaning “ spear-heads ”] pl. of سِنَانٌ:
[see also أَخَذَتْ رِمَاحَهَا, said of camels, voce رُمْحٌ:]
or if the pl. of سِنٌّ be intended by it, the meaning
is, enable ye them [i. e. the ridden beasts] to take of
the pasturage; and hence the trad., أَعْطُوا السِّنَّ
حَظَّهَا مِنَ السِّنِّ, i. e. Give ye the possessors of the
سِنّ [meaning tooth] their share of the سِنّ which
is the pasture. (L.) السِّنُّ is also used for ذَوَاتُ
السِّنِّ [The possessors of the tooth] as meaning the
slave and horses and the like and other animals,
[collectively, in like manner as خُفٌّ and حَافِرٌ are
used,] in a trad. of 'Omar. (L.) And it is said in
a trad. of Ibn-Dhee-Yezen, لَأُوطِئَنَّ أَسْنَانَ العَرَبِ
كَعْبَهُ, for ذَوِى أَسْنَانِ العَرَبِ, meaning [I will
assuredly make] the great men and the nobles [of
the Arabs to tread upon his ankle]. (L.) [But
اسنان in this instance may be pl. of سِنٌّ in the
sense here next following; so that ذوى اسنان
may be rendered the advanced in age.]) ―
-b2-  Hence,
(L,) (tropical:)  Life; (S, M, L, Msb;) metaphorically
used in this sense as indicative of its length and
its shortness; (L;) [for the teeth vary with the
length of life;] the measure, (K,) or extent, of
life; (Msb, K;) [the age attained;] used in relation to human beings and others: (M, L, K:)
of the fem. gender in this sense also, (M, L,
Msb,) because meaning مُدَّةٌ: (Msb:) pl. أَسْنَانٌ,
(M, L, K,) only. (M, L.) You say رَجُلٌ حَدِيثُ
السِّنِّ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  A young man. (S, Msb, K, all
in art. حدث.) And جَاوَزْتُ أَسْنَانَ أَهْلِ بَيْتِى (assumed tropical:)  [I
have exceeded] the lives of the people of my house.
(L.) And صَدَقَنِى سِنَّ بَكْرِهِ [and سِنُّ بَكْرِهِ, expl.
in art. بكر]. (L.) ―

the primary signification: (L:) it signifies also

says, فُلَانٌ مِنْ أَهْلِ السُّنَّةِ [Such a one is of the

of the directions, or evidences, of the law, الكِتَابُ
وَالسُّنَّةُ meaning the Kur-án and the Traditions:
(L:) [thus used, it may be rendered the institutes
of the Prophet; or his rule or usage:] or in the
law it signifies the way of acting &c. that is pursued in religion without being made obligatory,
or necessary; it is what the Prophet persevered
in doing, or observing, with omitting, or neglecting, [it] sometimes; and if the said persevering is
in the way of religious service, it constitutes
[what are termed] سُنَنُ الهُدَى; if in the way of
custom, سُنَنُ الزَّوَائِدِ: so that سُنَّةُ الهُدَى [the سُنَّة
of right direction] is that of which the observance
is a completion of religion, and it is that to the
omission, or neglect, whereof attach blame and
misdemeanour; and سُنَّةُ الزَّوَائِدِ [the سُنَّة of supererogatory acts] is that of which the observance
is good, but to the omission, or neglect, whereof
neither blame nor misdemeanour attaches, such as
the ways of the Prophet in his standing and
