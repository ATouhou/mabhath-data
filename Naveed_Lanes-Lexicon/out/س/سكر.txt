↓ سكّرهُ, inf. n. تَسْكِيرٌ; (MF;) He stopped it up, or

سُكِرَتْ أَبْصَارُنَا: see 2.

means (tropical:)  Our eyes have been prevented from
seeing, and dazzled: (S, K:) or have been covered
over: (Aboo-' Amr Ibn-El-' Alà, S, K:) and ↓ سُكِرَتْ,
without teshdeed, have been prevented from seeing:
(Fr, K: *) or this latter, which is the reading of
El-Hasan, means, accord. to him, have been enchanted: (S:) or both mean, have been covered
and closed by enchantment, so that we imagined
ourselves to behold things which we did not
really see: (T, TA:) Mujáhid explains the latter
reading as meaning, have been stopped up; i. e.,
have been covered by that which prevented their
seeing, like as water is prevented from flowing by
a سِكْر [or dam]: (A 'Obeyd:) and another reading
is ↓ سَكِرَتْ, meaning, have become dazzled, like
those of the intoxicated: (Ksh, Bd: *) AO says
that أَبْصَارُ القَوْمِ ↓ سَكِرَتْ means (tropical:)  The people became
affected by a giddiness; and an affection like
cloudiness of the eye, or weakness of the sight,
came over them, so that they did not see; and
Aboo-'Amr Ibn-El-'Alà says that this signification is derived from سُكْرٌ; as though their eyes
were intoxicated: Zj says that عَيْنُهُ ↓ سَكِرَتْ means
(assumed tropical:)  his eye became dazzled, and ceased to see. (TA.)
―
-b4-  سُكِّرَ لِلْحَاجَةِ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  His judgment, or

camel throttles another with his arm so that he
almost kills him]. (S.)
4
اسكرهُ It (wine, or beverage,) intoxicated,
or inebriated, him; (S, A;) or deprived him of
his reason; (Msb;) as also, accord. to some,
↓ سَكَرَهُ; (MF, TA;) but the former is that which
commonly obtains; (TA;) [and ↓ سكّرهُ has the
same signification; or its inf. n.] تَسْكِيرٌ signifies
the causing, or making, to be affected with the
remains of intoxication. (KL. [See the pass.
part. n. of this last, below.]) The first is also said
of قريض [app. a mistranscription for قريص,
which may be syn. with قَارِصٌ, meaning “ sour
milk,” for this has an effect like intoxication
when too much of it has been drunk]; and thus
applied it is tropical. (TA.)
6
تساكر He feigned intoxication, or a state
of drunkenness. (S, A. *)
8
استكر الضَّرْعُ The udder became full of milk.
(MA.) ―
-b2-  And استكرت السَّمَآءُ The sky rained

-A3-  Also A certain herb, or leguminous plant, (بَقْلَةٌ,) of such as
are termed أَحْرَار [pl. of حُرٌّ], (Aboo-Nasr, K,)
which is of the best of بُقُول: (TA as from the
K: [but not in my MS. copy of the K nor in the
CK:]) AHn says that no description of its
general attributes or qualities had come to his
knowledge. (TA.)
سُكْرٌ an inf. n., (A, Mgh, K,) or a simple
subst., signifying Intoxication, inebriation, or
drunkenness; i. e. the state thereof; (S, Msb;)
a state that intervenes as an obstruction between
a man and his intellect; mostly used in relation
to intoxicating drinks: but sometimes as meaning
(assumed tropical:) such a state arising from anger, or from the
passion of love: a poet says,
سُكْرَانِ سُكْرُ هَوًى وَسُكْرُ مُدَامَةٍ
أَنَّى يُفِيقُ فَتًى بِهِ سُكْرَانِ
[Two intoxications, the intoxication of love and
the intoxication of wine: how shall a youth recover his senses in whom are two intoxications?].
(Er-Rághib, TA.)
سِكْرٌ a subst. from السَّكْرُ (Mgh, K) as meaning
“ the stopping up, or damming,” of the river, or
rivulet; (K;) i. e. A dam; a thing with which
a river, or rivulet, is stopped up; (S, * Msb, K,
TA;) and ↓ سَكْرٌ, originally an inf. n., occurs in
the same sense: (Mgh:) the pl. of the former is
سُكُورٌ. (K.)
سَكَرٌ Wine: (K:) so, accord. to Fr and others
in the Kur [xvi. 69], تَتَّخِذُونَ مِنْهُ سَكَرًا وَرِزْقًا حَسَنًا,
meaning, ye obtain therefrom wine, and raisins
and dried dates and the like; this being said
before wine was prohibited: (TA:) and the
[beverage called] نَبِيذ (S, A) prepared from dried
dates: (S:) so in the Kur, ubi suprà: (S:) or
the expressed juice of fresh ripe dates when it has
become strong; (Mgh, Msb;) originally an inf. n.:
(Mgh:) or an infusion of dried dates, untouched
by fire: (A 'Obeyd:) a beverage, (A,) or نَبِيذ,
(K,) made from dried dates and from كَشُوث
[a species of cuscuta, or dodder] (A, K) and
myrtle, آس, (A,) which is the most bitter beverage in the world, (A,) and forbidden like wine;
(TA;) or made from dried dates and كشوث,
disposed layer upon layer, upon which water is
poured; and some assert that sometimes myrtle
(آس) is mixed with it, and this increases its
strength: (AHn:) also anything that intoxicates: (K:) and what is forbidden [that is obtained] from fruit (I'Ab, T, K) [of the palm-tree
and grape vine], meaning wine, before its being
forbidden; and الرِّزْقُ الحَسَنُ is what is lawful
[that is obtained] from grapes and dates: (I 'Ab,
T, TA:) and vinegar; (K;) accord. to some of
the expositors of the Kur, ubi suprà; but this is
a meaning unknown to the leading lexicologists:
(B, TA:) and food: (K:) so accord. to AO
alone; as in the following saying of a poet;
جَعَلْتَ أَعْرَاضَ الكِرَامِ سَكَرَا
[Thou hast made the reputations of the generous
to be food: or] thou hast made the vituperation
of the generous to be food to thee: but the leading
lexicologists disallow this; and Zj says that the
more probable meaning here is wine. (TA.)

-b2-  and سِكِيرٌ.
سَكْرَةٌ A fit of intoxication: (A, Mgh:) pl.
سَكَرَاتٌ. (Mgh.) You say, ذَهَبَ بَيْنَ الصَّحْوَةِ
وَالسَّكْرَةِ He went away in state between that
of sensibility and insensibility, or mental perception and inability thereof. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And
(tropical:)  A fit of anger. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And (tropical:)  An overpowering sensation of delight, affecting youth.
(TA.) ―
-b4-  سَكْرَةُ المَوْتِ (tropical:)  [The intoxication of death;
meaning] the confusion of the intellect by reason
of the severity of the agony of death: (B, TA:)
the oppressive sensation attendant upon death,
which deprives the sufferer of reason: (Bd in
1. 18:) the oppressive sensation, (S, A, * Mgh, K,)
and disturbance of the mind, and insensibility,
(K,) attendant upon death. (S, * A, Mgh, K.)
And in like manner, سَكْرَةُ الهَمِ, (K,) and النَّوْمِ,
(TA,) (tropical:)  The oppressive sensation, &c., attendant
upon anxiety, (K,) and upon sleep. (TA.)

شَيْلَم; (see زُؤَانٌ;) a certain plant, app. called
by the former name because a decoction thereof
is used as an anæsthetic; said to be] the same
that is called مُرَيْرَآءُ, that is [often found] in
wheat. (TA.)
سَكْرَانُ (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K) and سَكْرَانٌ, (TA,)
which latter is seldom used, and is of the dial. of
the Benoo-Asad, as is said in the S and Msb of
its fem., (TA,) and ↓ سَكْرٌ; (K; [in the TA ↓ سَكِرٌ,
but this is afterwards mentioned in the K as an
intensive epithet;]) fem. [of the first,] سَكْرَى;
(S, Mgh, Msb, K;) and [of the second,] سَكْرَانَةٌ;
(S, Msb, K;) and [of the third,] سَكْرَةٌ; (K; [in
the TA سَكِرَهٌ;]) Intoxicated; inebriated; drunken:
(S, Msb, K:) [see سُكْرٌ:] pl. سُكَارَى [which is
said in the TA to be also pl. of سَكِرٌ] and سَكَارَى,
(S, Msb, K:) of which the former is the more
common, or, as some say, the latter, and the
former of which is said to be the only instance of
the kind, except كُسَالَى and عُجَالَى and غُيَارَى,
(TA,) [to which should be added حُيَارَى, and
probably some other instances,] and سَكْرَى; (S,
K;) or this is a fem. sing. applied as an epithet
to a pl. n.; (Fr;) and in the Kur iv. 46, ElAamash read سُكْرَى, with damm, which is very
strange, since no pl. of the measure فُعْلَى is
known. (TA.) Th says that the words of the
Kur [iv. 46] لَا تَقْرَبُواالصَّلَاةَ وَأَنْتُمْ سُكَارَى [Engage
ye not in prayer when ye are intoxicated] was
said before the prohibition of wine was revealed:
others say that the meaning is, when ye are
intoxicated with sleep. (TA.)

سُكَّرٌ [Sugar;] a certain sweet substance, (TA,)
well known: (Msb, TA:) a Pers. word, (S,)
arabicized, (S, K,) from شَكَرْ: (K:) n. un. with ة
[signifying a piece of sugar]: (S, K:) it is hot
and moist, accord. to the most correct opinion;
but some say, cold: and the best sort of it is the
transparent, called طَبَرْزَذٌ; and the old is more
delicate than the new: it is injurious to the
stomach, engendering yellow bile; but the juice
of the لَيْمُون and نَارَنْج counteract its noxiousness:
it is said to be a word recently introduced; but
some say that it occurs in one trad. (TA.) ―

Also Like سُكَّر [or sugar] in sweetness: so used
by Aboo-Ziyád El-Kilábee. (TA.) ―

ever, they require to be dried artificially. (MF.)
―

by what is termed مَرَق, fall off, (K,) for the

سَيْكُرَانٌ A certain plant, always green, the
grain whereof is eaten: (K: [but this description
seems to be an incorrect abstract of what here
follows:]) Ed-Deenawaree [i. e. AHn] says, it is
of the plants that continue green throughout the
whole of the summer: I asked a sheykh of the
Arabs of Syria, and he said, it is the سُخَر, [correctly سُخَّر,] and we eat it in its fresh state, with
what an eating! and, he said, it has green grains,
like the grain of the رَازِيَانَج [or fennel], except
that they are round: (O:) [in the present day,
it is applied to henbane, or a species thereof:
accord. to Forskål, (Flora Aegypt. Arab.,
