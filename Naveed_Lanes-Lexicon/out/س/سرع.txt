سرع1
سَرُعَ, aor.
سَرُعَ, inf. n. سِرَعٌ (S, Msb, K) and
سَرَعٌ (TA [and mentioned in the K, but app. as a
simple subst.,]) and سِرْعٌ and سَرْعٌ and سَرَاعَةٌ (TA)
and سُرْعَةٌ, (K,) or this last is a simple subst.
from أَسْرَعَ, (Msb,) [but it is also generally used
as syn. with the inf. ns. before mentioned when
they are employed as simple substs., and is more
common than any of them,] He, or it, was quick,
expeditious, hasty, speedy, rapid, swift, or fleet:
[in course, tendency, action, speech, &c.:] (S,
K:) or, said of a man, i. q. أَسْرَعَ [which may
mean as above, or he hastened, made haste, or
sped,] in his speech and in his actions: (IAar,
TA:) but Sb makes a difference between سَرُعَ
and أَسْرَعَ: see the latter below: (TA:) one says
also سَرِعَ, aor.
سَرَعَ; a dial. var. of سَرُعَ: and ↓ تسرّع,
said of an affair, or event, signifies the same as
سَرُعَ. (TA.) One says, السِّرَعَ السِّرَعَ like الوَحَآءَ
الوَحَآءَ, (S, K,) i. e. [Make thou] haste; or haste
to be first, or before, or beforehand: haste; or
haste to be first, &c. (S and TA in art. وحى.)
And سَرُعَ مَا فَعَلْتَ ذَاكَ, (S, * TA,) and سَرْعَ,
which is a contraction of the former; for the
Arabs contract by the suppression of dammeh
and kesreh because they are difficult of pronunciation, saying فَخْذٌ for فَخِذٌ and عَضْدٌ for عَضْدٌ,
but one should not say حَجْرٌ for حَجَرٌ, (S, TA,)
or the like, accord. to the Basrees, though the
Koofees allow the contraction in the case of
fet-hah also, as in سَلْفَ for سَلَفَ; (M in art.
سلف;) and one says also سُرْعَ, as a contraction
of سَرُعَ; all meaning سَرْعَانَ [i. e. Quick was thy
doing that: or how quick was thy doing that!
or, which is nearly the same, excellently quick
was thy doing that; for سَرُعَ is similar to قَضُوَ and
رَمُوَ, denoting excellence]. (TA.)

سَرَّعَ see 4.

مُسَارَعَةٌ signifies The hastening with another;
or vying, or striving, with another, in hastening;
or hastening to be, or get, before another or
others; (S, K;) إِلَى شَىْءٍ to a thing; (S;) as
also ↓ تَسَارُعٌ; syn. مُبَادَرَةٌ; (S, K;) with which,
also, [not, however, as it is expl. above, but in
the sense of بُدُورٌ, i. e. simply the hastening to a
thing,] ↓ إِسْرَاعٌ is syn. (TA.) One says, سَارَعُوا
إِلَى كَذَا and إِلَيْهِ ↓ تسارعوا, [They hastened, one
with another, &c., to such a thing,] both signifying the same. (S.) And [of a single person,]
سارع إِلَى الشَّىْءِ He hastened to the thing; syn.
بادر. (Msb.) And it is said in the Kur [iii. 127],
وَسَارِعُوا إِلَى مَغْفِرَةٍ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ [And vie ye, one with
another, in hastening to obtain forgiveness from
your Lord]. (TA.) And again, [iii. 170,]
الَّذِينَ يُسَارِعُونَ فِى الكُفْرِ Who fall into unbelief
hastily, or quickly, (Bd, Jel,) and eagerly. (Bd.)

اسرع is originally trans.; (S, K;) [signifying
He quickened, or hastened, himself, or his going,
&c.;] and hence the saying, in a trad., إِذَا مَرَّ
أَحَدُكُمْ بِطِرْبَالٍ مَائِلٍ فَلْيُسْرِعِ المَشْىَ [When any
one of you passes by a high wall, or the like, that
is inclining, let him quicken, or hasten, the pace,
or going]. (K, * TA.) But [it is used also elliptically, as meaning He hastened, in an intrans.
sense; he made haste; he sped; he went quickly;
and hence] you say, اسرع فِى السَّيْرِ, (S, K,) like
سَرُعَ [He was quick, expeditious, hasty, speedy,
rapid, swift, or fleet, in going, journeying, or
pace]: (K:) or [rather he hastened, made haste,
or sped, therein; for] اسرع signifies he endeavoured, or sought, and affected, to be quick, &c.,
as though he hastened the pace, or going; but
↓ سَرُعَ denotes what is as it were an innate quality:
(Sb:) the verb being originally trans., when you
say of one اسرع فى السير it is as though [meaning]
he urged himself forward with haste; or he quickened, or hastened, the pace, or going; and it is
only because the meaning is understood by the
persons addressing one another, that the objective
complement is not expressed: (Lth, K:) or the
verb may be trans. by means of a particle and
without a particle: or when made immediately
trans., the phrase may be meant to be understood
as elliptical. (TA.) [Accord. to Fei,] اسرع فِى
مَشْيِهِ, &c., inf. n. إِسْرَاعٌ, is originally اسرع مَشْيَهُ
[He quickened, or hastened, his pace, or going];
فى being redundant; or اسرع الحَرَكَةَ فِى مَشْيِهِ
[he quickened, or hastened, the motion in his
going]: and اسرع إِلَيْهِ means اسرع المُضِىَّ إِلَيْهِ [he
quickened, or hastened, the going to him]. (Msb.)
↓ سرّع is syn. with اسرع. (TA.) And you say,
إِلَى الشَّرِّ ↓ تسرّع, (S, K,) meaning He hastened,
or made haste, to [do] evil, or mischief; (K;) as
also تزرّع. (Sgh and K in art. زرع.) And ↓ تسرّع
بِالأَمْرِ He hastened to do the thing, or affair;
syn. بَادَرَ بِهِ. (TA.) See also 3. ―
-b2-  اسرع إِلَيْهِ
occurs in a trad. as meaning He was quick, or
hasty, in being angry with him, or in blaming
him, or in reviling him. (Mgh.) ―
-b3-  اسرع بِهِ: see
[its contr.] بَطَّأَ بِهِ. ―
-b4-  أَسْرَعُوا signifies also, Their
beasts on which they rode were, or became, quick,
swift, or fleet. (AZ, S, K.)
-A2-  مَا أَسْرَعَ مَا صَنَعْتَ
كَذَا [How quick was thy doing that!]. (S, K.)

سَرْعٌ [originally an inf. n. of سَرُعَ, like سِرْعٌ and
سَرَعٌ accord. to the TA]: see سَرِيعٌ, in two places.
سَرَعٌ: see [1 and] سُرْعَةٌ.
سَرِعٌ: see سَرِيعٌ.
سُرْعَةٌ Quickness, expedition, haste, speed, rapidity, swiftness, or fleetness; [of course, tendency, action, speech, &c.;] (S, K;) as also
↓ سَرَعٌ; (K;) [the former said in the K, and the
latter in the TA, to be an inf. n. of سَرُعَ:] and a
hastening, making haste, or speeding; i. q. إِسْرَاعٌ
[inf. n. of 4]; (TA;) or a subst. therefrom.
(Msb.) You say, عَجِبْتُ مِنْ سُرْعَةِ ذَاكَ [I wondered at the quickness, &c., of that]. (S.)
سَرْعَانَ and سُرْعَانَ and سِرْعَانَ (S, K) and ↓ سَرُعَانَ,
the last with damm to the ر (IAar,) occurring in
the phrase سرعانَ ذَا خُرُوجًا, (IAar, S, K,) meaning سَرُعَ ذَا خُرُوجًا [Quick is this in coming forth:
or how quick is this in coming forth! or, which is
nearly the same, excellently quick &c.], (S, K,)
are dial. vars., changed from the original form,
which is سَرُعَ, and, for this reason, (S,) made
indecl., with the final vowel of سَرُعَ for their
termination. (S, K.) The word سرعان is used as
a simple enunciative [placed before its inchoative],
and also as an enunciative denoting wonder: [see
بُطْآنَ:] and hence the saying, (K,) لَسَرْعَانَ مَا
صَنَعْتَ كَذَا How quick was thy doing that! (S, K.)
The saying سَرَعَانَ ذَا إِهَالَةٌ originated from the fact
that a man had a lean ewe, her snivel running
from her nostrils by reason of her leanness, and
it being said to him “ What is this? ” he answered, “Her grease: ” whereupon the asker said
as above: the last word is in the accus. case as a
denotative of state; and the meaning is, Quick,
or how quick, is this snivel [coming forth] in the
state of melted grease! or the last word is a
specificative, under the supposition that the
action is transferred [from its proper agent,
which thus becomes a specificative], as in the
phrase تَصَبَّبَ زَيْدٌ عَرَقًا; and the meaning to be
understood is, Quick, or how quick, is the melted
grease of this! the saying is applied to him who
tells of a thing's coming to pass before its time:
(O, K:) it is a prov. (TA.)
-A2-  سَرْعَانُ; and its
fem., سَرْعَى: see سَرِيعٌ, in two places: see also
the paragraph here next following, in two places,
سَرَعَانُ النَّاسِ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) and ↓ سَرْعَانُ
الناس, (IAar, K,) The first, or foremost, of the
men, or people, (IAar, S, Mgh, Msb, K,) striving,
one with another, to be the first to do a thing;
(K;) so says As, with reference to soldiers
hastening: (TA:) the former word in this phrase
is [distinguished from سَرْعَانَ in being] declinable
in every case: (S:) in two trads. in which the
phrase occurs, we find it differently related,
سَرَعَان and سُرْعَان; the latter being pl. of سَرِيعٌ.
(TA.) سَرَعَانُ الخَيْلِ, also, signifies The first or
foremost, of the horsemen, and sometimes they
said الخيل ↓ سَرْعَانُ. (K.) Abu-l-'Abbás says
that when سرعان is an epithet applied to men, it
has both of the above-mentioned forms; but when
applied to others, the former is the more chaste,
though the latter is allowable. (TA.)
سَرُعَانَ: see سَرْعَانَ.
سُرَاعٌ; and its fem., with ة: see what next
follows, in three places.
سَرِيعٌ Quick, expeditious, hasty, speedy, rapid,
swift, or fleet; [in course, tendency, action,
speech, &c.;] (S, Msb, * TA;) as also ↓ سَرِعٌ [and
↓ سَرْعٌ] and ↓ سُرَاعٌ, of which the fem. is with ة,
and ↓ سَرْعَانُ, of which the fem. is سَرْعَى; (TA;)
i. q. ↓ مُسْرِعٌ, (K,) which signifies as above;
(TA;) [and which also signifies hastening, making
haste, or speeding;] and ↓ مِسْرَعٌ, also, signifies
quick, &c., (سَرِيع,) to [do] good or evil: (K:)
the pl. of سريع is سُرْعَانٌ, (K,) and سِرَاعٌ is [also
a pl. of the same,] syn. with مُسْرِعُونَ. (Msb.)
You say, فَرَسٌ سَرِيعٌ and ↓ سُرَاعٌ [A quick, swift,
or fleet, horse]: (IB:) and ↓ حِجْرٌ سُرَاعَةٌ meaning
سَرِيعَةٌ [a quick, swift, or fleet, mare]. (K.) And
↓ اِسْعَ عَلَى رِجْلِكَ السَّرْعَى [Go thou quickly; lit.
go thou, or walk thou, or run thou, upon thy
quick, or swift, leg]. (Fr.) And ↓ جَآءَ سَرْعًا meaning سَرِيعًا [He, or it, came quickly, hastily,
speedily, &c.]. (TA.) And God is said [in the
Kur ii. 198, &c.] to be سَرِيعُ الحِسَابِ [Quick in
reckoning], meaning that his reckoning will
inevitably come to pass; or that one reckoning
will not divert Him from another reckoning, nor
one thing from another thing; or that his actions
are quick, none of them being later than He
desireth, because it is done without manual operation and without effort, so that He will reckon
with mankind, after raising them from death and
congregating them, in the twinkling of an eye,
without numbering, or calculating: (K:) and [in
like manner He is said in the same, chap. vi.,
last verse, to be] سَرِيعُ العِقَابِ [quick in punishing]. (El-Mufradát, B.) ―
-b2-  Also A certain kind
of going, or pace; coupled with سُنْبُكٌ, which
signifies another kind thereof. (Ibn-Habeeb,
TA.) ―
-b3-  [السَّرِيعُ The ninth metre (بَحْر) in prosody, in which each hemistich originally consisted
of مُسْتَفْعِلُنْ مُسْتَفْعِلُنْ مَفْعُولَاتُ.] ―
-b4-  And أَبُو سَرِيعٍ
The [shrub called] عَرْفَج: or the fire that is
therein. (K. [See زَحْفَةٌ.])
-A2-  Also A shoot, or
twig, that falls from the بَشَام [or tree of the
balsam of Mekkeh]: pl. سِرْعَانٌ and سُرْعَانٌ. (K.)
أَسْرَعُ [More, and most, quick, expeditious,
hasty, speedy, rapid, swift, or fleet, of course,
tendency, action, speech, &c.]. [It is said, of
God, in the Kur vi. 62,] وَهُوَ أَسْرَعُ الحَاسِبِينَ
[And He is the quickest of the reckoners]. (K.)
[The fem.] سُرْعَى is applied to a she-camel by
Honeyf El-Hanátim [as meaning Surpassingly
quick or fleet]. (IAar, TA in art. بهى.)
