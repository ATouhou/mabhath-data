سكرجسُكُرُّجَةٌ, or سُكُرَّجَةٌ, accord. to different authorities, (TA,) or both, (MF,) not an Arabic word,
but occurring in a trad.; [arabicized from the
Pers. سُكْرَچَهٌ, meaning A saucer;] a sort of small
bowl-shaped vessel, in [or out of] which one eats:
it is of two sizes; the larger holding six ounces;
and the smaller, three ounces, or four mithkáls,
or between two thirds of an ounce [and some
other quantity more or less (for there is an
omission in this place in my original)]: in such
vessels, placed upon the tables, around the meats,
the Arabs used to put sauces and the like to
excite the appetite and to aid digestion: expl.
by Ed-Dáwoodee as a small, varnished, bowlshaped vessel. (TA.)
