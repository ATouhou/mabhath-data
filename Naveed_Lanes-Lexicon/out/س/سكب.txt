سَكْبٌ and ↓ سَاكِبٌ and ↓ سَكُوبٌ and ↓ سَيْكَبٌ
(K) and ↓ سَكِيبٌ (CK [omitted in the TA and in
my MS. copy of the K]) and ↓ أُسْكُوبٌ (K)
Water poured out or forth, or being poured out
or forth: or poured out or forth, (K, TA,) running upon the surface of the earth without any
excavation: (TA:) or the first signifies water
poured out or forth; and is an inf. n. used as an
epithet, like صَبٌّ and غَوْرٌ applied as epithets to
water: and ↓ سَكُوبٌ, water running upon the surface of the earth without any excavation: and
↓ أُسْكُوبٌ, water pouring out or forth, or being
poured out or forth; (S;) or, as some say, pouring much: (Har pp. 469 et seq.:) and also this
last, running water: (TA:) or this signifies
دَائِمُ الهَطَلَانِ [i. e. continually pouring, or continually pouring dispersedly and in large drops;
as also سَكْبٌ; for hence it appears evident that
الهَطَلَانُ الدَّائِمُ as an explanation of السَّكْبُ and
الأُسْكُوبُ in the K is a mistake for الدَّائِمُ الهَطَلَانِ];
and is applied as an epithet to water and to
blood; (A;) and also [probably in this sense] to
clouds (سَحَابٌ); and to a wound made with a
spear or the like (طَعْنَةٌ): and ↓سَاكِبٌ is applied
as an epithet to tears (دَمْعٌ). (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence]
سَكْبٌ applied to a horse means (tropical:)  Wide in step:
(S, A, K:) or fleet, or swift, or excellent in running; (A, K;) that runs much: (Mgh, TA:)
or light, or active: and ↓ أُسْكُوبٌ, so applied, has
one or another of these meanings: (A:) or the
former, thus applied, that runs vehemently; as
also فَيْضٌ; likened to water pouring forth: (EthThaalebee, TA:) also, (K, TA,) applied to a
horse and a man and a boy, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  light of
spirit; and brisk, lively, or sprightly, (K, TA,)
in work, or action. (TA.) السَّكْبُ was the name
of the first horse possessed by the Prophet;
(Mgh, * K;) as also ↓ السَّكَبُ: and the name of
a horse of Shebeeb Ibn-Mo'áwiyeh. (K.) ―
-b3-
[Hence also,] (assumed tropical:)  A certain sort of clothes, or garments, (T, S, K,) thin so as to resemble dust, and
as though resembling pouring water by reason of
its thinness; and so, accord. to IAar, ↓سَكَبٌ. (T,
TA.) ―
-b4-  Applied to a man, (assumed tropical:)  Tall; (K;) a
dial. var. of سَقْبٌ [q. v.]. (TA.) ―
-b5-  And (tropical:)  A
necessary thing or affair: (A, K, TA:) and (tropical:)  a
disgrace (سُبَّةٌ) that is necessary, or unavoidable.
(A, TA.) Lakeet Ibn-Zurárah said to his brother
Maabad, when he required him to ransom him
with two hundred camels, he being a captive,
نُمِيطُ عَنْكَ شَيْئًا يَكُونُ عَلَى أَهْلِ بَيْتِكَ سُبَّةً سَكْبًا,
meaning (tropical:)  [We will put away from thee a thing
that would be to the people of thy house] a necessary, or an unavoidable, disgrace. (TA.)
-A2-
Also Copper, or brass; syn. نُحَاسٌ: or lead:
(IAar, K:) and so ↓ سَكَبٌ, (K,) in the latter
sense, or in both senses, or in all the senses. (TA.)
سَكَبٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, latter
half, in three places.
-A2-  Also A certain kind of
tree, (S, K,) of sweet odour, (S,) as though its
odour were that of [the perfume called] خَلُوق
[q. v.], growing apart from others, upon a single
root, having a downy substance, and leaves like
those of the صَعْتَر [a species of origanum, or
marjoram], except in being more green: it grows
in the plains and the valleys; and what has dried
up thereof is of no use to any one: it has a fruit
which is eaten, and the people of El-Hijáz make
of it a [beverage such as is termed] نَبِيذ: its fruit
does not grow forth in one year, but only in
several years: AHn says that the سَكَب is a herb
that rises to the height of a cubit, having dustcoloured leaves like those of the هِنْدَبَآء [or endive],
and a blossom intensely white, of the form of that
of the فِرْسِك [i. e. peach, or a species or variety
thereof]: (TA:) n. un. with ة: (S, TA:) As
mentions the سَكَب as one of the plants of the
plain, or soft, tracts. (TA.) ―
-b2-  It is also said to
be The [plant called] ريح [app. رَيِّح or رِيح
which seem to be coll. gen. ns. of each of which
the n. un. is with ة (see رَيِّحَةٌ)], having a yellow
blossom. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And The anemone (شَقَائِقُ
النُّعْمَانِ). (K.) ―
-b4-  And One of the trees of the
hot season. (TA.)
سَكَابٌ and سَكَابِ, the latter [indecl., with kesr
for its termination,] like قَطَامِ, and ↓ سَكَّابٌ, [all
app. meaning The fleet, or swift, like السَّكْبُ and
الأُسْكُوبُ,] are names of certain horses. (K: the
second only mentioned in the S.)

of Aquarius;] the eleventh of the signs of the
Zodiac; also called الدَّلْوُ. (Kzw.)

the tent, or house, extending towards the earth];

-A2-  Also i. q. إِسْكَافٌ
[A maker of shoes or boots, or a sewer of leather,
&c.]; like ↓ إِسْكَابٌ: or a blacksmith. (K.)
المِسْكَبَةُ [altered in a copy of the A from
المَسْكَبَةُ, which may perhaps be the right word,]
The higher, or highest, rivulet, or small channel
for irrigation, from which the other rivulets, or
small channels, are supplied with water. (A.)
―
-b2-  [In a copy of the A (in art. سطب), المَسْطَبَة,
which I believe to be in that instance a mistranscription for المسكبة, occurs expl. as meaning
(assumed tropical:)  The Milky Way.]
