of my copies, but it is said in the JK that this
latter is used in relation to death, and such is
generally the case,]) or سَيَاقٌ, like سَحَابٌ, (TA,

its correctness,]) and سِيَاقَةٌ and مَسَاقٌ, (O, K, TA,)
He drove the cattle [or the beast]; he urged the
cattle [or the beast] to go; (Mgh;) and ↓ استاقها

↓ سوّقها; (TA;) or تَسْوِيقٌ, the inf. n. [or this last],
signifies the driving well: (KL:) [and accord.
to Freytag, ↓ استساق, followed by an accus., signifies the same as سَاقَ as expl. above; but for
this he names no authority.] Hence, in the Kur
[lxxv. 30], إِلَى رَبِّكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ المَسَاقُ (TA) i. e. To
thy Lord, and his judgment, on that day, shall be
the driving. (Bd, Jel.) And the saying, in a
trad., لَاتَقُومُ السَّاعَةُ حَتَّى يَخْرُجَ رَجُلٌ مِنْ قَحْطَانَ
يَسُوقُ النَّاسَ بِعَصًاهُ [properly rendered The resurrection, or the hour thereof, shall not come to pass
until a man come forth from the tribe of Kahtán
driving the people with his staff], allusive to his

-b3-  And ساق إِلَى
المَرْأَةِ مَهْرَهَا, (K,) or صَدَاقَهَا, (S, Msb,) inf. n.
سِيَاقٌ; (TA;) and ↓ اساقهُ; (Msb, K;) (tropical:)  He sent
to the woman her dowry; (K, TA;) or conveyed
it, or caused it to be conveyed, to her; (Msb;)
though consisting of dirhems or deenárs; because
the dowry, with the Arabs, originally consisted
of camels, which are driven. (TA.) And hence,
مَاسُقْتَ إِلَيْهَا, meaning (assumed tropical:)  What didst thou give her
as her dowry? occurring in a trad.; or, as some
related it, مَا سُقْتَ مِنْهَا, i. e. What didst thou give
for her, or in exchange for her? (TA.) And
ساق إِلَيْهِ الشَّىْءَ (assumed tropical:)  [He made, or caused, the thing

You say, فُلَانٌ يَسُوقُ الحَدِيثَ أَحْسَنَ سِيَاقٍ (tropical:)  [Such
a one carries on the narrative, or discourse, in
the best manner of doing so]. (Mgh, TA.) And
إِلَيْكَ يُسَاقُ الحَدِيثُ (tropical:)  [To thee as its object the
narrative, or discourse, is carried on]. (TA.)
And كَلَامٌ مَسَاقُهُ إِلَى كَذَا (tropical:)  [Speech whereof the
carrying-on is pointed to such a thing]. (TA.)
And جِئْتُكَ بِالحَدِيثِ عَلَى سَوْقِهِ (tropical:)  [I uttered to
thee the narrative, or discourse, after the proper
manner of the carrying-on thereof]. (TA.) [In
like manner also one says,] ساق الأُمُورَ أَحْسَنَ
مَسَاقٍ (assumed tropical:)  [He carried on, or prosecuted, affairs, or
the affairs, in the best manner of doing so]. (A
in art. حوذ.) ―
-b6-  سَوْقُ المَعْلُومِ مَسَاقَ غَيْرِهِ [from
ساق الحَدِيثَ expl. above] means (assumed tropical:)  The asking
respecting that which one knows in the manner
of one's asking respecting that which he knows
not: a mode of speech implying hyperbole: as
when one says, أَوَجْهُكَ هٰذَا أَمْ بَدْرٌ [Is this thy
face or a full moon?]. (Kull p. 211.) ―
-b7-  ساق
said of a sick man, (K,) and ساق نَفْسَهُ, [app. thus

spirit; or was at the point of death, in the
agony of death, or at the point of having his soul

former, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  It had a سَاق [i. e. stem, stock,
or trunk]. (K, TA.)
3
ساوقهُ He vied, or competed, with him, in
driving: (K: [in the CK, for فى السَّوْقِ, is put
فى السُّوْقِ:]) or he vied, or competed, with him to
decide which of them twain was the stronger;
from the phrase قَامَتِ الحَرْبُ عَلَى سَاقٍ. (S.)
[Hence,] one says بَعِيرٌ يُسَاوِقُ الصَّيْدَ (tropical:)  [A camel
that vies with the animals of the chase in driving
on, or in strength]. (JK, Ibn-'Abbád, O, K, TA.)
―
-b2-  مُسَاوَقَةٌ is also syn. with مُتَابَعَةٌ [app. as meaning (assumed tropical:)  The making to be consecutive, or successive,
for it is added], as though driving on one another,
or as though one portion were driving on another.

-b3-  [Freytag also
assigns to ساوق the meaning of He, or it, followed
(secutus fuit), as on the authority of the Hamáseh;
but without pointing out the page; and it is not
in his index of words explained therein.]

TA:) the vulgar say ↓ سَوَّقُوا. (TA.)
6
تساوقت الإِبِلُ (tropical:)  The camels followed one
another; (Az, O, Msb, K, TA;) and in like
manner one says تَقَاوَدَت; (O, K, * TA;) as

تساوقت الغَنَمُ (tropical:)  The sheep, or goats, pressed, one

another. (O.) [See also 7.] ―
-b2-  The lawyers say,

إِسْتَوَقَ see 1, first sentence.
10
إِسْتَسْوَقَ see 1, first sentence.
سَاقٌ The shank; i. e. the part between the knee
and the foot of a human being; (Msb;) or the
part between the ankle and the knee (K, TA) of a
human being; (TA;) the ساق of the human foot:
(S, TA:) and [the part properly corresponding
thereto, i. e. the thigh commonly so called, and
also the arm, of a beast;] the part above the
وَظِيف of the horse and mule and ass and camel,
and the part above the كُرَاع of the ox-kind and
sheep or goat and antelope: (TA:) [it is also
sometimes applied to the shank commonly so
called, of the hind leg, and, less properly, of the
fore leg, of a beast: and to the bone of any of the
parts above mentioned: and sometimes, by synecdoche, to the hind leg, and, less properly, to the
fore leg also, of a beast: it generally corresponds
to ذِرَاعٌ: of a bird, it is the thigh commonly so
called: and sometimes the shank commonly so
called: and, by synecdoche, the leg:] it is of the
fem. gender: (Msb, TA:) and for this reason,
(TA,) the dim. is ↓ سُوَيْقَةٌ: (Msb, TA:) the pl. [of
mult.] is سُوقٌ (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K) and سِيقَانٌ
and [of pauc.] أَسْؤُقٌ, (S, O, K,) the و in this last
being with ء in order that it may bear the dammeh.
(O, K.) A poet says,
لِلْفَتَى عَقْلٌ يَعِيشُ بِهِ
حَيْثُ تَهْدِى سَاقَهُ قَدَمُهْ
meaning The young man has intelligence whereby
he lives when his foot directs aright his shank.
(IAar, TA.) And one says of a man when difficulty, or calamity, befalls him, كَشَفَ عَنْ سَاقِهِ
[lit. He uncovered his shank; meaning (assumed tropical:)  he prepared himself for difficulty]: so says IAmb: and
hence, he says, (TA, [in which a similar explanation is cited from ISd also,]) they mention the
ساق when they mean to express the difficulty of
a case or an event, and to tell of the terror
occasioned thereby. (K, TA.) Thus, the saying
يَوْمَ يُكْشَفُ عَنْ سَاقٍ, (S, K, TA,) in the Kur
[lxviii. 42], (S, TA,) [lit. On a day when a shank
shall be uncovered,] means (assumed tropical:)  on a day when difficulty, or calamity, shall be disclosed. (I'Ab,
Mujáhid, S, K, TA.) It is like the saying,
قَامَتِ الحَرْبُ عَلَى سَاقٍ, (S, TA,) which means
(assumed tropical:)  The war, or battle, became vehement, (Msb in
this art. and in art. حرب,) so that safety from
destruction was difficult of attainment: (Id. in
art. حرب:) and كَشَفَتِ الحَرْبُ عَنْ سَاقٍ, [as also
شَمَّرَتْ عَنْ سَاقِهَا,] i. e. (assumed tropical:)  The war, or battle,
became vehement. (Jel in lxviii. 42.) And in
like manner, وَالْتَفَّتِ السَّاقُ بِالسَّاقِ, (K, TA,) in the
Kur [lxxv. 29], (TA,) means (assumed tropical:)  And the affliction
of the present state of existence shall be combined
with that of the final state: (K, TA:) or it means
when the [one] leg shall be inwrapped with the
other leg by means of the grave-clothes. (TA.)
One says also, قَامَ القَوْمُ عَلَى سَاقٍ (assumed tropical:)  The people
or party, became in a state of toil, and trouble, or
distress. (TA.) And قَرَعَ لِلْأَمْرِ سَاقَهُ, [originating
from one's striking the shin of his camel in order
to make him lie down to be mounted; lit. He
struck his shank for the affair;] meaning (assumed tropical:)  he
prepared himself for the thing, or affair; syn.
تَشَمَّرَ: (JK:) or he was, or became, light, or
active, and he rose, or hastened, to do the thing;
or (assumed tropical:)  he applied himself vigorously, or diligently,
or with energy, to the thing, or affair; i. q.
شَمَّرَ لَهُ [q. v.]; (TA;) or تَجَرَّدَ لَهُ. (A and TA in
art. قرع [q. v.: see also ظُنْبُوبٌ, in several places].)
[It is also said that] أَوْهَتْ بِسَاقٍ means كِدْتُ
أَفْعَلُ [i. e. I nearly, or almost, did what I purposed: but this explanation seems to have been
derived only from what here, as in the TA,
immediately follows]: Kurt says, describing the
wolf,
وَلٰكِنِّى رَمَيْتُكَ مِنْ بَعِيدٍ
فَلَمْ أَفْعَلْ وَقَدْ أَوْهَتْ بِسَاقِ
[i. e., app., But I shot at thee from afar, and I
did not what I purposed, though it (the shot,
الرَّمْيَةُ, I suppose, being meant to be understood,)
maimed a shank: which virtually means, though
I nearly did what I purposed: the poet, I assume, says اوهت بساق for the sake of the measure
and rhyme, for أَوْهَتْ سَاقًا: see what is said, in
the explanations of the preposition بِ, respecting
the phrase وَامْسَحُوا بِرُؤُسِكُمْ]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  By a
secondary application, سَاقٌ signifies (assumed tropical:)  [A greave;
i. e.] a thing that is worn on the ساق [or shank]
of the leg, made of iron or other material. (Mgh.)
―
-b3-  Also (tropical:)  [The stem, stock, or trunk, i. e.] the
part between the أَصْل [here meaning root, or foot,
(though it is also syn. with ساق in the sense in
which the latter is here explained,)] and the
place where the branches shoot out; (TA;) or
the support; (Msb;) or the جِذْع; (S, K;) of a
tree, or shrub: (S, Msb, K, TA:) pl. [of mult.]
سُوقٌ (Msb, TA) and سُوقٌ and سُوُوقٌ and سُؤُوقٌ
and [of pauc.] أَسْوُقٌ and أَسْؤُقٌ. (TA.) It is
related in a trad. of Mo'áwiyeh, that a man said,
I applied to him to decide in a litigation with the
son of my brother, and began to overcome him
therein; whereupon he said, Thou art like as
Aboo-Duwád says,
أَنَّى أُتِيحَ لَهُ حِرْبَآءُ تَنْضُبَةٍ
لَا يُرْسِلُ السَّاقَ إِلَّا مُمْسِكًا سَاقَا
[Whencesoever, or however, a preparation is made
for him, to catch him, he is like a chameleon
of a tree of the kind called تَنْضُب, he will not
loose the stem thereof unless grasping a stem]:
he meant that no plea of his came to nought but
he clung to another; likening him to the chameleon, which places itself facing the sun, and ascends
half-way up the tree, or shrub, then climbs to the
branches when the sun becomes hot, then climbs to a
higher branch, and will not loose the former until
it grasps the other. (O, TA. *) ―
-b4-  [Hence, perhaps, as it seems to be indicated in the O,] one says,
وَلَدَتْ فُلَانَةُ ثَلَاثَةَ بَنِينَ عَلَى سَاقٍ, (K, [in the
copies of which, however, I find ثَلَاثَ put for
ثَلَاثَةَ,]) or عَلَى سَاقٍ وَاحِدٍ, (S,) or وَاحِدَةٍ, (O,)
i. e. (tropical:)  Such a woman brought forth three sons, one
after another, without any girl between them:
(S, O, K, TA:) so says ISk: and وُلِدَ لِفُلَانٍ ثَلَاثَةُ
أَوْلَادٍ سَاقًا عَلَى سَاقٍ, i. e. (tropical:)  Three children were
born to such a one, one after another. (TA.) And
بَنَى القَوْمُ بُيُوتَهُمْ عَلَى سَاقٍ وَاحِدٍ (assumed tropical:)  [The people, or
party, built their houses, or constructed their
tents, in one row or series]. (TA.) ―
-b5-  سَاقٌ also
signifies (assumed tropical:)  The soul, or self; syn. نَفْسٌ: hence the
saying of 'Alee (in the war of the [schismatics
called] شُرَاة), لَابُدَّ لِى مِنْ قِتَالِهِمْ وَلَوْ تَلِفَتْ سَاقِى
(assumed tropical:)  [There is not for me any way of avoiding combating them, though my soul, or self, should perish
by my doing so]. (Abu-l-' Abbás, O, TA.) So too
in the saying, قَدَحَ فِى سَاقِهِ [as though meaning
(tropical:) He cankered his very soul]: (IAar, TA in
art. قدح:) [or] he deceived him, and did that
which was displeasing to him: (L in that art.:)
or (tropical:)  he impugned his honour, or reputation; from
the action of canker-worms (قَوَادِح) cankering the
stem, or trunk, of a shrub, or tree. (A in that
art.)
-A2-  سَاقُ حُرٍّ [is said to signify] The male of
the قَمَارِىّ [or species of collared turtle-doves of
which the female is called قُمْرِيَّةٌ (see قُمْرِىٌّ)];
(S, Msb, K;) i. e. the وَرَشَان: (S, Msb:) the
former appellation being given to it as imitative
of its cry: (As, K:) it has neither fem. nor pl.:
(AHát, TA:) or السَّاقُ is the pigeon; and الحُرُّ,
its young one: (Sh, K:) the poet Ibn-Harmeh uses
the phrase كَسَاقِ ابْنِ حُرٍّ. (O, TA.) [See more
in art. حر.]
سَوْقٌ: see سِيَاقٌ.
سُوقٌ [A market, mart, or fair;] a place in
which commerce is carried on; (ISd, Msb, TA;)
a place of articles of merchandise: (Mgh, TA:)
so called because people drive their commodities
thither: (TA:) [in the S unexplained, and in the
K only said to be well-known:] of the fem. gender,
and masc., (S, Mgh, Msb, K, *) the former in the
dial. of the people of El-Hijáz, and the latter in
that of Temeem, (S and Msb voce زُقَاقٌ, q. v.,)
the former the more chaste, or the making it
masc. is a mistake: (Msb:) pl. أَسْوَاقٌ: (TA:)
the dim. is ↓ سُوَيْقَةٌ [with ة, confirming the opinion
of those who hold سُوقٌ to be only fem.]: also signifying merchandise, syn. تِجَارَةٌ; as in the phrase,
جَاءَتْ سُوَيْقَةٌ [Merchandise came]. (TA.) ―
-b2-
[Hence,] سُوقُ الحَرْبِ (tropical:)  The thickest, or most
vehement part (حَوْمَة) of the fight; (S, K, TA;)
and so الحَرْبِ ↓ سُوقَةُ; i. e. the midst thereof.
(TA.)
سَوَقٌ Length of the shanks: (S, K:) or beauty
thereof: (K:) or it signifies also beauty of the
shank. (S.)
سَاقَةٌ (tropical:)  The rear, or hinder part, of an army:
(S, Mgh, K, TA:) pl. of ↓ سَائِقٌ; being those who
drive on the army from behind them, and who
guard them: (TA:) or as though pl. of سَائِقٌ, like
as قَادَةٌ is of قَائِدٌ. (Mgh.) And hence, سَاقَةُ
الحَاجِّ (tropical:)  [The rear of the company of pilgrims].
(TA.)
سُوقَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  A subject, and the subjects, of a king;
(K, TA;) so called because driven by him;
(TA;) contr. of مَلِكٌ; (S, Mgh, Msb;) whether
practising traffic or not: (Mgh:) not meaning of
the people of the أَسْوَاق [or markets], as the vulgar
think; (Msb;) for such are called سُوقِيُّونَ, sing.
سُوقِىٌّ: (Ham p. 534:) it is used alike as sing.
and pl. (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and dual (Mgh, Msb)
and masc. and fem.: (S, K:) but sometimes it
has سُوَقٌ for its pl. (S, K.)
-A2-  سُوقَةُ الطُّرْثُوثِ [in
the CK, erroneously, التُّرْثُوثِ] The part of the
[plant called] طرثوث that is below the نِكْعَة [or
نَكَعَة or نُكَعَة, which is the head from the top to
the extent of a finger, or the flower at the head
thereof]; (O, K;) sweet and pleasant: so says
Ibn-' Abbád: (O:) AHn says [of the طرثوث],
it is like the penis of the ass, and there is no part
of it more pleasant, nor sweeter, than its سوقة;
which is in some instances long; and in some,
short. (TA.)
-A3-  See also سُوقٌ, last sentence.
سُوقِىٌّ [Of, or relating to, the سُوق, or market].
Its pl., سُوقِيُّونَ, means The people of the سُوق
(Ham p. 534.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] أَدِيمٌ سُوقِىٌّ A skin,
or hide, prepared, or dressed; in a good state:
or not prepared or dressed: it is ascribed to the
vulgar: and there is a difference of opinion respecting it: the second [explanation, or meaning,]
is that which is commonly known. (TA.)
سَوِيقٌ Meal of parched barley (شَعِير), or of
[the species thereof, or similar grain, called] سُلْت,
likewise parched; and it is also of wheat; but is
mostly made of barley (شعير); (MF, TA;) what
is made of wheat or of barley; (Msb, TA;) well
known: (S, Msb, K, TA:) [it is generally made
into a kind of gruel, or thick ptisan, being
moistened with water, or clarified butter, or fat
of a sheep's tail, &c.; (see لَتَّ;) and is therefore
said (in the Msb in art. حسو and in the KT voce
أَكْلٌ, &c.,) to be supped, or sipped, not eaten:
but it is likewise thus called when dry; and in
this state is taken in the palm of the hand and
conveyed to the mouth, or licked up: (see حَافّق,
and قَمِحَ:) it is also made of other grains beside
those mentioned above; and of several mealy
fruits; of the fruit of the Theban palm; (see
حَتِىٌّ;) and of the carob; (see خَرُّوبٌ;) &c.:]
it is also, sometimes, with ص: so says IDrd in
the Jm: and he adds, I think it to be of the dial.
of Benoo-Temeem: it is peculiar to that of Benul-' Ambar: (O, TA:) the n. un. [meaning a portion, or mess, thereof] is with ة: (AAF, TA in
art. جش:) and the pl. is أَسْوِقَةٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And
Wine: (AA, K:) also called سَوِيقُ الكَرْمِ. (AA,
TA.)
سِيَاقٌ [an inf. n. of 1 (q. v.) in several senses.
―
-b2-  As a subst., properly so termed,] (tropical:)  A dowry,

is likewise originally an inf. n.: see 1]. (TA.)
―
-b3-  [Also, as a subst. properly so termed, (assumed tropical:)  The
following part of a discourse &c.; opposed to
سِبَاقٌ: you say سِبَاقُ الكَلَامِ وَسِيَاقُهُ (assumed tropical:)  the preceding
and following parts of the discourse; the context,
before and after: see, again 1. And (assumed tropical:)  The drift,
thread, tenour, or scope, of a discourse &c.]
سُوَيْقَةٌ dim. of سَاقٌ, q. v.: (Msb, TA:)

stem]; applied to a plant. (Ibn-Abbád, K.) ―
-b3-
And (assumed tropical:)  The طَلْع [or spadix] of a palm-tree, when
it has come forth, and become a span in length.
(K.)
سَائِقٌ [Driving, or a driver;] the agent of the
