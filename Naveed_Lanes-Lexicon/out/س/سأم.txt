سَآمَةٌ exceeds مَلَالٌ. (Ham pp. 775-6.) It is
said in the Kur [xli. 49], لَا يَسْأمُ الْإِنْسَانُ مِنْ
دُعَآءِ الْخَيْرِ [Man will not turn away with disgust
from, or will not be weary of, praying for good,
or wealth, or prosperity]. (Msb.) And in a
trad., إِنَّ اللّٰهَ لَا يَسْأَمُ حَتَّى تَسْأَمُوا Verily God will
not turn away with disgust until ye turn away
with disgust; like لَا يَمَلُّ حَتَّى تَمَلُّوا, and thus the
trad. is commonly related. (TA.) And it is
related in a trad. of 'Áïsheh that she used to say
to the Jews, عَلَيْكُمْ السَّأْمُ وَالذَّأْمُ وَاللَّعْنَةُ [Disgust,
or loathing, and contempt, and cursing, rest upon
you]: thus related with ء, meaning ye shall turn
away with disgust from your religion: but commonly related without ء [and with a different
meaning], as will be stated hereafter [in art.
سوم]. (IAth, TA in this art. and in art. سوم.)
