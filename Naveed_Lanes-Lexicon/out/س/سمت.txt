سمت1
سَمْتٌ [as an inf. n.] is syn. with قَصْدٌ [in an
intrans. sense], (S, * Msb,) and هُدًى [in the sense
of رَشَادٌ], and اِسْتِقَامَةٌ: (Msb:) or حُسْنُ نَحْوٍ:
(M, K:) you say, سَمَتَ, aor.
سَمُتَ, (S, M, K,)
and
سَمِتَ, (K,) or in this case the former only,
(TA,) inf. n. سَمْتٌ, (M, TA,) He pursued a
right course; syn. قَصَدَ: (S, TA:) or (assumed tropical:)  he followed a good direction (M, K, * TA *) in the way
of religion [&c.]. (TA.) Accord. to Khálid Ibn-
Dabbeh, it signifies (assumed tropical:)  The following the truth and
the right way or direction, and being a good
neighbour, and doing little harm. (TA.) [But
more commonly, or primarily, it relates to the
course that one pursues in journeying.] An Arab
of the desert, of [the tribe of] Keys, says,
سَوْفَ تَجُوبِينَ بِغَيْرِ نَعْتِ
تَعَسُّفًا أَوْ هٰكَذَا بِالسَّمْتِ
i. e. [Thou shalt traverse (addressing a woman),
or, more probably, ye shall traverse (addressing
camels or other beasts), a land without a description], journeying without any sign of the way
and without any track [for guidance], such
being the meaning of تعسّفا, or thus, pursuing a
right course, السَّمْتُ meaning القَصْدُ. (TA.)
Accord. to Sh, السَّمْتُ signifies The seeking,
searching, or inquiring, for, or after, the right
way or direction. (TA.) ―
-b2-  السَّمْتُ also signifies
قَصدُ الطَّرِيقِ [i. e. سَمْتُ الطَّرِيقِ signifies The
road's having a right, or direct, tendency]: (M:)
or [سَمْتُ الشَّىْءِ] signifies قَصْدُ الشَّىْءِ [i. e. The
thing's having a right, or direct, tendency]. (K.)
[This last explanation has been misunderstood by
the Turkish translator of the K; who has hence
been led to assert that one says, سَمَتَ الشَّىْءَ as
well as سَمَتَ نَحْوَهُ, meaning قَصَدَهُ: it is تَسَمَّتَهُ
that (like سَمَتَ نَحْوَهُ) signifies قَصَدَهُ; not
سَمَتَهُ, for سَمَتَ is always intrans.] ―
-b3-  Also The
journeying (S, M, K) upon the road (M, K)
[guided only] by opinion (S, M, K) and conjecture: (S:) or, as some say, the journeying by
conjecture and opinion, not upon a [known] road.
(TA.) A poet says,
↓ لَيْسَ بِهَا رِيعٌ لِسَمْتِ السَّامِتِ
[There is not, or was not, in it, a road of any
kind (see رِيعٌ) for the journeying by opinion and
conjecture of him who so journeys]. (S, TA.)
―
-b4-  And The pursuing a course, or direction, [of
any kind,] and [particularly] (assumed tropical:)  in religion and in
worldly affairs. (TA.) You say, هُوَ يَسْمُتُ سَمْتَهُ
(assumed tropical:)  He pursues his [another's] way, or course, doing
as he [the latter] does. (TA.) [سَمْتَهُ is here an
absolute (not an objective) complement of يَسْمُتُ;
like سَيْرَهُ in the phrase هُوَيَسِيرُ سَيْرَهُ. See also
سَمْتٌ below.] ―
-b5-  Also سَمَتَ, aor.
سَمُتَ, inf. n. سَمْتٌ,
(assumed tropical:)  He (a man) was, or became, grave, staid,
steady, sedate, or calm. (Msb.) ―
-b6-  And سَمَتَ لَهُمْ,
aor.
سَمِتَ, (Fr, K,) inf. n. سَمْتٌ, (Fr, TA,) (assumed tropical:)  He
prepared, arranged, or disposed, for them, the
mode, or manner, of speech, and of judging, or
forming an opinion, (Fr, K, TA,) and of work,
or action. (Fr, TA.)

تَسْمِيتٌ The keeping to the سَمْت [i. e. road,
&c.]. (K.) It is said in a trad., فَانْطَلَقْتُ لَا أَدْرِى
أَيْنَ أَذْهَبُ إِلَّا أَنَّنِى أُسَمِّتُ, meaning [And I departed, not knowing whither I should go, but] I
kept to the course, or direction, of the road: or
as some say, I prayed to God. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also
(assumed tropical:)  The mentioning of God, (S, M, A, Msb, K,)
or, as in some copies of the S, the mentioning of
the name of God, [like تَسْمِيَةٌ, inf. n. of سَمَّى,]
(TA,) upon, or over, a thing, (S, M, A, Msb, K,)
or in any case. (TA.) One says, سَمَّتَ عَلَى
الطَّعَامِ (assumed tropical:)  He mentioned the name of God upon,
or over, the food. (TK.) ―
-b3-  And سمّت لَهُ and
عَلَيْهِ, inf. n. تَسْمِيتٌ, (assumed tropical:)  He prayed for what was
good for him; prayed for a blessing upon him;
as also شمّت. (L and TA in art. شمت, q. v.)
In a trad. respecting eating, it is said, سَمُّوا اللّٰهَ
وَدَنُّوا وَسَمِّتُوا, meaning (assumed tropical:)  [Pronounce ye the name
of God, and take what is next you of the food,
or make your words to be near together, (see 2
in arts. دنو and سمو,) and,] when ye have ended,
invoke a blessing upon him at whose abode or
table ye have eaten. (TA.) ―
-b4-  التَّسْنِيتُ also
signifies, (M, K,) or تَسْمِيتُ العَاطِسِ, (S, Msb,)
(assumed tropical:)  The praying for the sneezer; (M, Msb, K;)
saying, هَدَاكَ اللّٰهُ إِلَى السَّمْتِ [May God guide
thee to the right, or good, course]; because the
person sneezing is disturbed and disquieted: so
says AAF: (M, TA:) or the saying to him,
يَرْحَمُكَ اللّٰهُ [May God have mercy on thee]:
(Th, S, M:) or التَّسْمِيتُ signifies the saying بَارَكَ
اللّٰهُ فِيكَ [May God bless thee]: (ISh, TA:) it is
with س and with ش: (S, M, Msb:) one says
سَمَّتَهُ, (T, M, Msb,) i. e. سَمَّتَ العَاطِسَ, meaning
He prayed for the sneezer, [saying as above,]
(A,) and شَمَّتَهُ: (T, M, Msb:) Th says that the
former is preferred, (S,) or is the original, (Msb,)
being from السَّمْتُ signifying القَصْدُ, (S, M, Msb,)
and الهُدَى, and الاِسْتِقَامَةُ, (Msb,) and المَحَجَّةُ,
(S,) or الطَّرِيقُ; (M;) as though one made a
person his object by this prayer; (M;) and that
the س is changed [by some] into ش: (TA:) but
A 'Obeyd says that the pronunciation with ش is
of higher authority, and more common. (S,
Msb.) The Prophet said, When any of you
sneezes, let him say, الحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ [Praise be to
God]; and he who prays for him (الَّذِى يُشَنِّتُهُ
[or يُسَمِّتُهُ]), يَرْحَمُكَ اللّٰهُ; and let him [i. e. the
sneezer] say [in reply], يَهْدِيكُمُ اللّٰهُ وَيُصْلِحُ بَالَكُمْ
[May God direct you aright, and render good
your state, or condition, or case]. (Har p. 250.)

(S, A, Mgh, Msb, K, TA,) of good people, (S, A,
Mgh, K, TA,) in respect of religion, not in
respect of goodliness of person: (TA:) a metaphorical meaning, from the same word as signifying “ a road,” or “ way. ” (Mgh.) One says,
إِنَّهُ لَحَسَنُ السَّمْتِ (assumed tropical:)  Verily he is good in respect of
the way, or course, that he pursues in his religion
and his worldly affairs: (TA:) or هُوَحَسَنُ

particularly, The azimuth. ―
-b7-  And سَمْتُ الرَّأْسِ

ecliptic: from سَمْتٌ signifying “ a road,” or
