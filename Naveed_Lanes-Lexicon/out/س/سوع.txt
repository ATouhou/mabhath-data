سوع1
سَاعَتِ الإِبِلُ, aor. تَسُوعُ, (S, K,) inf. n. سَوْعٌ,
(S,) The camels were left to themselves, (S, K,)
without a pastor; (K;) as also ساعت with
تَسِيعُ for its aor. and سَيْعٌ for its inf. n. (Sh.)

عَامَلَهُ مُسَاوَعَةً [He bargained with him for
work by, or for, the hour,] is from السَّاعَةُ, like
مُيَاوَمَةً from اليَوْمُ. (S, K. [See also the last sentence of the second paragraph of art. سعى.]) [It
is added in the S, that neither of them is used
otherwise than thus: but accord. to SM one says
also,] ساوعهُ, inf. n. سِوَاعٌ, He hired him, or took
him as a hireling, for the hour. (TA.)
4
اساعهُ He left to himself, or itself, left alone,
or neglected, and lost, or destroyed, him, or it.
(K.) Er-Rághib says, [but why, I do not well
see,] that the meaning of neglecting, or the like, is
imagined as derived from السَّاعَةُ. (TA.) You say,
أَسَعْتُ الإِبِلَ I left the camels to themselves, left
them alone, or neglected them. (S.) And رُبَّ
نَاقَةٍ تُسِيعُ وَلَدَهَا حَتَّى تَأْكُلَهُ السِّبَاعُ, meaning
[Scarce, or many, a she-camel] leaves to itself, or
leaves alone, or neglects, her young one [so that
the beasts of prey devour it]. (TA.) [See also 4
in art. سيع.]
-A2-  أَسْوَعَ He (a man, Zj) passed from
سَاعَة to سَاعَة [i. e. time to time, or hour to hour];
(Zj, K;) as also اساع, inf. n. إِسَاعَةٌ: (Zj, TA:)
or he remained behind, or held back, or delayed,
for a سَاعَة [i. e. a time, or an hour]. (Ibn-
'Abbád, K.)
سَاعٌ: see سَاعَةٌ, in two places.
سَوْعٌ and ↓ سُوَاعٌ i. q. هدْءٌ, as used in the phrase,
جَآءَنَا بَعْدَ سَوْعٍ مِنَ اللَّيْلِ [He came to us after a
period, or portion, of the night; or after about a
third or fourth part of the night had elapsed,
when men were asleep, or at rest, and the night,
and the foot of the passenger, were still; or after
a third part of the night]: (S, K: *) or this
phrase means he come to us after a سَاعَة [i. e. a
short period, or an hour,] of the night. (TA.).
سَاعَةٌ [An hour;] one of the divisions of the
night and the day; (Lth, K, TA;) both of which
together consist of four and twenty of those divisions; each of them, when they are of equal
length, consisting of twelve such divisions; (TA;)
[also termed سَاعَةٌ فَلَكِيَّةٌ (an astronomical hour;
fifteen دَرَجَات of time; sixty minutes of time;)
because ساعة alone is often used in a vague
sense, as meaning what is termed سَاعَةٌ زَمَانِيَّةٌ;
i. e.] a time of night or of day: but used absolutely
by the Arabs as meaning a time; a while; a
space, or period; an indefinite [short] time; and
a little while; (Msb;) a [short or] little portion,
or division, [or space, or period,] of the night and
of the day: (TA:) and السَّاعَةُ signifies the pre-
sent time: (S, K:) pl. سَاعَاتٌ and ↓ سَاعٌ, (S, Msb,
K,) [or the latter is rather a coll. gen. n. of which
ساعة is the n. un.,] and سِوَاعٌ. (Msb.) It is used
unrestricted in the Kur [vii. 32 and in other
places], where it is said, لَا يَسْتَأْخِرُونَ سَاعَةً (Msb)
They will not remain behind (Bd) for a time, or
any while, (Msb,) or the shortest time: or they
shall not seek to remain behind, by reason of
intense terror. (Bd.) And so in a trad., where
it is said, مَنْ رَاحَ فِى السَّاعَةِ الأُولَى Whoso goeth
in the first time; not in the first astronomical
ساعة, for then it would necessarily mean that he
who should come in the latter part thereof would
be on a par with the former person, which is not
the case. (Msb.) [سَاعَةً signifies, as shown above,
For, or during, an hour: and awhile; for a
little while; during a short time; as in the
phrase,] جَلَسْتُ عِنْدَكَ سَاعَةً I sat with thee, or at
thine abode, for a little while, or during a short
time. (TA.) [And فِى سَاعَةٍ, In a short time:
in a moment. And السَّاعَةَ, Now: just now: this
moment. And سَاعَتَئِذٍ, Then; at that time: or in
that hour.] And مُذْ سَاعَةٌٍ [A little while ago;]
in the first time near to us: (K in art. انف:) or
this signifies السَّاعَةَ [expl. above]. (Zj, T and M
in art. انف.) [And مِنْ سَاعَتِهِ At the moment
thereof; instantly. Hence, سَمَّ سَاعَةٍ An instantaneous poison.] ―
-b2-  السَّاعَةُ also signifies (tropical:)  The resurrection; (S, K, TA;) the raising of mankind
for the reckoning; also termed السَّاعَةُ الكُبْرَى:
(Er-Rághib, B:) or the time thereof: (K:) because of the quickness with which its reckoning
will be accomplished: (TA:) or because it will
come suddenly upon mankind, in a moment, and
all creatures will die at one cry. (Zj, Az, TA.)
Hence, in the Kur [liv. 1], اِقْتَرَبَتِ السَّاعَةُ (tropical:)  The
resurrection [or the time thereof] hath drawn
nigh. (Jel, TA.) And [in vii. 186 and lxxix. 42,]
يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ السَّاعَةِ (tropical:)  They ask thee concerning the
resurrection [or the time thereof]. (Bd, Jel,
TA.) And [in xxxi. last verse and xliii. 85,]
عِنْدَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ (tropical:)  With Him is the knowledge
of the resurrection, (TA,) or of the time thereof.
(Bd, Jel.) ―
-b3-  Also (assumed tropical:)  The death of one generation; termed, for distinction, السَّاعَةُ الوُسْطَى: as
in the saying of Mohammad, when he saw 'AbdAllah Ibn-Uneys, إِنْ يَطُلْ عُمْرُ هٰذَا الغُلَامِ لَمْ يَمُتْ
حَتَّى تَقُومَ السَّاعَةُ (assumed tropical:)  [If the life of this boy last
long, he will not die until the death of the generation shall come to pass]: accordingly it is said
that he was the last that died of the Companions.
(Er-Rághib, B.) ―
-b4-  Also (assumed tropical:)  The death of any
man; termed, for distinction, السَّاعَةُ الصُّغْرَى: as
in the Kur [vi. 31], قَدْ خَسِرَ الَّذَينَ كَذَّبُوا بِلِقَآءِ
اللّٰهِ حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءَتْهُمُ السَّاٰعَةُ بَغْتَةً (assumed tropical:)  [They have
suffered loss who disbelieved in, or denied as false,
the meeting with God until, when death came to
them suddenly]. (Er-Rághib, B) ―
-b5-  Also (assumed tropical:)  Difficulty, distress, or affliction; and so ↓ السَّاعُ. (TA.)
―
-b6-  And (assumed tropical:)  Distance, or remoteness. (TA.)
-A2-
See also سَائِعٌ.
سَاعَةٌ سَوْعَآءُ A severe, grievous, or distressing
[hour or time]; (S, K;) like the phrase لَيْلَةٌ
لَيْلَآءُ. (S.)
سُوَاعٌ: see سَوْعٌ.
-A2-  Also, (S, K, [in the CK
erroneously without tenween,]) and سَوَاعٌ, (Kh,
K,) A certain idol (S, K) which belonged to the
people of Noah, (S,) in whose time it was worshipped; then the deluge buried it, but Iblees exhumed it, and it was worshipped [again]; (K;)
so says Lth; (TA;) then it became the property
of [the tribe of] Hudheyl, (S, K,) and was at
Ruhát, (S,) and pilgrimage was performed to it:
(S, K:) or it belonged to [the tribe of] Hemdán:
(Bd, TA:) Abu-l-Mundhir says, I have not heard
the mention of it in the poems of Hudheyl: but
one of the Arabs, in verse, mentions Hudheyl as
paying devotion to it: (TA:) it is said that it
had the form of a woman: (Har p. 362:) [if so,
as a fem. proper name, it would be without tenween: but] it is mentioned in the Kur [lxxi. 22,
and is there with tenween]. (TA.) [See also وَدٌّ.]
هُوَ ضَائِعٌ سَائِعٌ He is left to himself, left alone,
or neglected. (S, * K, * TA.) ↓ سَاعَةٌ [is pl. of
سَائِعٌ; and also signifies] In a state of perdition
or destruction; perishing; or dying; in a pl.
sense; like جَاعَةٌ as signifying جِيَاعٌ, (K,) and
طَاعَةٌ as signifying مُطِيعُونَ. (TA.)
مُسِيعٌ: see the following paragraph.
مِسْيَاعٌ A she-camel that leaves her young one
so that the beasts of prey devour it: (Sh, K:) or
a she-camel that goes away in the place of pasturing: (S:) belonging to this art. and to art. سيع,
q. v. (K.) You say also, رَجُلٌ مِضْيَاعٌ مِسْيَاعٌ لِلْمَالِ
[A man who is wont to neglect the camels or the
like; or to leave them to themselves, or alone; or
to lose them]; and accord. to A'Obeyd, مُضِيعٌ
↓ مُسِيعٌ. (S.)
