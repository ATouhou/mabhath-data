syn. with سُوس.]) You also say, when you are

is a mistake. (S. [Thus I find it in one copy
of the S: but in another copy of the S, I find
سَوَّسْتِ, which is clearly wrong; and in the

to have disallowed.]) ―

the article السَّوَاسِى); and AHn says, I asked him
respecting it, and he said that this and the مَرْخ and
the مَنْح all three resemble one another; (M;) and it

emitting fire, (M,) or because it seldom gives a
