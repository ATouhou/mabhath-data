accord. to Fr, one well, or strongly, or compactly,

trad., مَا دَخَلَتِ السِّكَّةُ دَارَ قَوْمِ إِلَّا ذَلُّوا [The ploughshare enters not the abode of a people, or party,
but they become abased]; meaning, in consequence

(TA.) ―
-b2-  And A die, i. e. an engraved piece of
iron, (S, * Msb, K, TA,) having an inscription

Hence their saying, (S,) or the saying of the

(S, in the O سكّة مأبورة او مهرة مأمورة,) meaning
[The best of property is] a prolific filly (TA) or
a row of palm-trees fecundated: (S, TA:) or,
accord. to As, سكّة مأبورة here signifies a ploughshare properly prepared [for ploughing]; and,
he says, the meaning is, that the best of property
is a brood [of a mare] or seed-produce. (S.) [It
has been suggested to me that, if طريقة in the
explanation above have the signification here
assigned to it, the epithet مصطفّة is redundant; and therefore that طريقة alone may be the
proper explanation, and may mean in this case,
as it does in many others, a tall palm-tree, or the
tallest of palm-trees, or a smooth palm-tree, or a
palm-tree the head of which is reached by the
hand; and that مصطفّة may have been added in
consequence of misunderstanding, and سطر substituted for طريقة for the same reason: but I
think it much more probable that the epithet has
been added because طريقة is ambiguous; and this
is confirmed by what here follows.] ―
-b2-  Also A
زُقَاق [meaning street]: (S, O, * Msb:) or [rather]
a wide زُقَاق: (Msb:) or an even road, (K, TA,)
