سهو1
سَهَا عَنْهُ, (S, Msb,) or فِيهِ, (K,) aor. يَسْهُو,
inf. n. سَهْوٌ (S, Msb, K) and سُهُوٌّ, (M, K,) He
was, or became, unmindful, forgetful, neglectful,
or heedless, of it, or inadvertent to it; (S, Msb;)
namely, a thing; syn. غَفَلَ عَنْهُ: (S, * Msb:) or
he forgot it, or neglected it, (نَسِيَهُ,) and was, or
became, unmindful, forgetful, &c., of it, or inadvertent to it, (غَفَلَ عَنْهُ,) his mind adverting to
another thing or affair or case; (K, TA;) thus
expl. in the M and T; so that السَّهْوُ and الغَفْلَةُ
and النِّسْيَانُ are made to be one [in signification];
(TA;) but accord. to Esh-Shiháb, السَّهْوُ is a
slight غَفْلَة [or unmindfulness &c.] of that which
is within the scope of the retentive faculty, such
as when one's attention is roused by the least
rousing thereof; whereas النسيان denotes its
passing away from the memory entirely; though
all are used in one sense by a careless reliance
upon the understanding of the reader or hearer:
in the Msb it is said that a distinction is made
between السَّاهِى and النَّاسِى by the latter's being
applied to him who, when he is reminded, remembers, and the former's being applied to him
who is in the contrary case: accord. to IAth,
سَهَافِى الشَّىْءِ means he neglected, or omitted, the
thing unknowingly; and سَهَا عَنْهُ, he neglected, or
omitted, it knowingly: or, as some say, السَّهْوُ is
the doing wrong from unmindfulness (عَنْ غَفْلَة);
as when an insane person reviles another, which
is pardonable; and as when one drinks wine and
then some unpleasing action proceeds from him
unintentionally, which is punishable. (TA.) One
says, سَهَافِى الصَّلَاةِ, and عَنْهَا, i. q. غَفَلَ [He was,
or became, unmindful in prayer, and of it].
(TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence, app., as implying an unexpected event,] حَمَلَتْ سَهْوًا She (a woman, S)
conceived in menstruis. (Az, S, Z, K.) And حَمَلَتْ
بِهِ أُمُّهُ سَهْوًا His mother conceived him in menstruis. (JK.) ―
-b3-  السَّهْوُ also signifies السُّكُونُ (JK,
S, K) and اللِّينُ (JK, S,) [app. as an inf. n., i. e.
as meaning The being still, or quiet, and gentle;
though it is immediately added in the S that the
pl. is سِهَآءٌ; for it seems that an early transcriber
of the S has omitted to insert after اللَّينُ the
words وَالسَّاكِنُ وَاللَّيِّنُ: see سَهْوٌ below]. One
says, فَعَلَهُ سَهْوًا رَهْوًا He did it voluntarily, without
its being asked, or demanded; (K, TA;) and
without constraint: (TA:) or quietly, or calmly,
without being hard, or difficult. (TA in art. رهو.)
And سَهَا إِلَيْهِ He looked at him, or it, with
motionless eye. (Msb, TA.) And العَيْنُ تَسْهُو فِيهِ
The eye expatiates in it; syn. تَنْبَسِطُ. (JK.)
-A2-
سَهَاوَةٌ, as denoting a quality of a camel, The being
easy to ride; (K;) an inf. n., of which the verb
is سَهُوَ. (TA.)
-A3-  مَالٌ لَا يُسْهَى وَلَا يُنْهَى [Cattle]
of which the end is not to be reached. (AA, JK,
S, K.) You say, يَرَاحُ عَلَى بَنِى فُلَانٍ مِنَ المَالِ مَا
لَا يُسْهَىوَلَا يُنْهَى [There returns from the place
of pasture in the evening, or afternoon, to the
sons of such a one, of cattle,] what is not to be
numbered for multitude: (T, TA:) or what is
not to be computed, or computed by conjecture.
(IAar, TA.) And ذَهَبَتْ تَمِيمُ فَلَا تُسْهَى وَلَا تُنْهَى,
meaning لَا تُذْكَرُ [i. e. Temeem went away, and
will not be remembered, or will not be mentioned]:
a saying of El-Ahmar. (TA.)
3
ساهاهُ, inf. n. مُسَاهَاةٌ, i. q. غَافَلَهُ [app. meaning He acted with him in the manner of him who
is unmindful, forgetful, neglectful, heedless, or
inadvertent]. (TA.) [Or] the inf. n. signifies
[The acting with moderation with another; or]
the abstaining from going to the utmost length in
social intercourse: (S, K:) or the being easy, or
facile, with another: (A, TA:) or the behaving
in a good [or pleasing] manner in social intercourse: (T, TA:) or the comporting oneself with
another, or others, (مُخَالَقَةٌ,) in a good manner,
in social intercourse. ('Eyn, M, TA.) And one
says, هُوَ يُسَاهِى أَصْحَابَهُ He comports himself with
his companions, or does so with good nature; syn.
يُخَالِقُهُمْ. (TA.) And ساهاهُ means also He
mocked at him, or derided him. (TA.)

(S, K,) in [the asterism called] بَنَات نَعْش الكُبْرَى,
(S, [in the K, erroneously, بنات نعش الصُّغْرَى,])

[i. e.] a small star by that called العَنَاقُ, (which
latter is the middle star [
ζ] of the three in the tail of
Ursa Major, Kzw,) by looking at which persons
try their powers of sight; (Kzw, TA;) mentioned
in art. قود [voce قَائِدٌ, q. v.]; (K;) [it is the

shows me the moon]. (S, TA. [See also Freytag's
Arab. Prov. vol. i. pp. 527—9.]) And one says,
أَنَّى يَلْتَقِى سُهَيْلٌ وَالسُّهَا How can Suheyl [or
Canopus] meet Es-Suhà? for the former is
southern and the latter is northern. (Har p. 276.)
سَهْوٌ [an inf. n. used as an epithet,] Easy; applied to a man, and to an affair, (K, TA,) and to
an object of want: (TA:) and so [the fem.]
سَهْوَةٌ, applied to a mare; and applied to a she-mule as meaning easy in pace, that does not
fatigue her rider: the epithet سَهْوٌ, however, is
not applied to a he-mule: so in the T: (TA:)
[but] it is applied to a he-camel, meaning easy to
ride: and سَهْوَةٌ to a she-camel, (K, TA,) meaning
gentle, easy to ride: and رَاهٍ ↓ سَاهٍ, applied to
a he-camel, means [likewise] gentle in pace; and
so [the pls.] سَوَاهٍ رَوَاهٍ applied to camels: (TA:)
[and so ↓ سَهْوَآءُ applied to a mare; for] a certain
mare was named السَّهْوَآءُ because of the gentleness
of her pace. (TA.) Also, applied to water, Cool,
sweet, or limpid; easy of descent in the throat.
(K, * TA.) And قَوْسٌ سَهْوَةٌ A bow that is compliant, (K, TA,) and easy. (TA.) And رِيحٌ سَهْوٌ

heard by A'Obeyd from more than one of the
people of El-Yemen: (S:) or it signifies, (K,) or
signifies also, (JK,) four sticks, or pieces of wood,
(JK, K,) or three, (K,) which are placed crosswise, one upon another, and upon which is then

سِهْوَآءٌ, (IAar, JK, S, TA,) like سِعْوَآءٌ and تِهْوَآءٌ,
all with kesr, on the authority of IAar, but in the
K ↓ سَهْوَآء, (TA,) A [portion, or short portion,
such as is termed] سَاعَة, of the night; (S, K, TA;)
and (S, TA) the first part thereof: (JK, S, TA:)

case with tenween, and] which seems to mean a
period in which people are unmindful of the
places, or ways, in which things are, or should be,
sought by them; or سهوان may be from سَاهِيَةٌ,
expl. below: and مِنَ اللَّيْلِ ↓ سِهْوٌ signifies the
same as سِعْو and سَعْو [and سِهْوَآء] and سِعْوَاء.
(Ham p. 708.) One says, لَقِيتُهُ بَعْدَ سِهْوَآءٍ مِنَ
اللَّيْلِ i. e. [I met him after a portion, or short
portion, of the night; or] after the first part of
the night had passed. (JK.)
سَهْوَان: see سَاهٍ:
-A2-  and see also سِهْوَآءٌ.
السُّهَيَّا dim. of السُّهَا, q. v.
سَاهٍ Unmindful, forgetful, neglectful, heedless,
or inadvertent; (JK, S, Msb, K;) as also ↓ سَهْوَانُ;
(S, K;) whence the prov.,
إِنَّ المُوَصَّيْنَ بَنُو سَهْوَانْ
(S) i. e. Only the unmindful [lit. the sons of the
unmindful] are such as require to be enjoined:
(S, Meyd:) or, as some say, by بنو سهوان are
meant all mankind; because all become unmindful: but the most correct explanation is, that those
who are enjoined to do a thing are subject to unmindfulness: it is applied to him who is unmindful of pursuing that which he is commanded to
do: and سهوان may be syn. with [the inf. n.]
سَهْوٌ; or it may be an epithet, syn. with سَاهٍ, and
is applied to Adam, because he forgot his cove-
nant, so that بنو سهوان may mean the sons of
Adam, and hence, the unmindful. (Meyd. [See
also Freytag's Arab. Prov. i. 3-4.]) ―
-b2-  See also
سَهوٌ.
سَاهِيَةٌ A tract of land long and wide, without

Colours; but also meaning sorts, or species; and
here used in this latter sense, as is indicated in the

M: (TA:) or it signifies, (JK,) or signifies also,
(TA,) various sorts (ضُرُوبٌ مُخْتَلِفةٌ, JK, TA)
of pace of camels; like أَسَاهِيجُ: (TA:) and its
sing. is ↓ أَسْهَآءَةٌ. (JK.)
