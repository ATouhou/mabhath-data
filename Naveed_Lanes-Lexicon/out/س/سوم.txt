سَوْمٌ, inf. n. of سَامَ, primarily signifies The
going, or going away, engaged, or occupied, in
seeking, or in seeking for or after, or in seeking to
find and take or to get, a thing: and sometimes
it is used as meaning the going, or going away;
as when it is said of camels [or the like]: and
sometimes, as meaning the seeking, or seeking for
or after, or seeking to find and take or to get;
as when it relates to selling or buying. (Er-Rághib, TA.) ―
-b2-  You say, سَامَتِ المَاشِيَةُ (S,
Mgh, Msb, TA) or النَّعَمُ (M) or المَالُ, (K,) aor.
تَسُومُ, (S, M, Msb,) inf. n. سَوْمٌ, (S, M, Mgh,

TA) by themselves (Msb) where they pleased;
and in like manner, الغَنَمُ [the sheep or goats]: or
went away at random, or roved, pasturing where
they pleased. (TA.) ―
-b3-  [Hence, سام, inf n as
above, He did as he pleased.] You say, خَلَّيْتُهُ
وَسَوْمَهُ I left him to do as he pleased. (S, M, K *
[In the CK, خَلّاهُ وَسَوَّمَهُ لِمَايُرِيدُهُ is put for خَلَّاهُ
وَسَوْمَهُ لِمَا يُرِيدُهُ; and the like is done in one of
my copies of the S. See also 2.]) ―
-b4-  And
سَامَ, (S,) or سَامَتِ الإِبِلُ, and الرِّيحُ, (M, K,) or
الرِّيَاحُ, (S,) inf. n. as above, (S, M,) He, or it,
(S,) or the camels, and the wind, (M, K,) or the
winds, (S,) passed, went, or went on or along:
(S, M, K:) or سَوْمٌ signifies the passing, &c.,
quickly; one says of a she camel, سَامَت, aor. and
inf. n. as above, she passed, &c., quickly; (As,
TA;) and hence the saying of Dhu-l-Bijádeyn
cited in art. عرض, voce تَعَرَّضَ: or the passing,
&c., quickly, with the desire of making a sound
in going along. (TA.) ―
-b5-  And سَامَتِ الطَّيْرُ عَلَى
الشَّىْءِ, (M, K,) aor. and inf. n. as above, (M,)
The birds went, [or hovered,] or circled, round

signifies any going, [or hovering,] or circling,
round about. (M.)
-A2-  [As mentioned in the first
sentence of this art.,] سَوْمٌ is also in selling and
buying. (S.) You say, سام السِّلْعَةَ, (Mgh, Msb,)
aor. and inf. n. as above, (Msb,) He (the seller)
offered the commodity, or article of merchandise,
(Mgh, Msb:) and it is also said of the purchaser,
like ↓ اِسْتَامَهَا, (Mgh, Msb,) meaning he sought to
obtain the sale of the commodity, or article of
merchandise: and one says also of the seller, and
of the purchaser, سام بِالسِّلْعَةِ, meaning he mentioned the price of the commodity [in offering it
for sale, and in offering to purchase it]: (Msb:)
and in like manner, سُمْتُ فُلَانًا سِلْعَتِى, inf. n. as
above, I said to such a one, “Wilt thou take [or
purchase] my commodity for such a price? ”
(TA:) and سَامَنِى بِسِلْعَتِهِ he (the seller, Msb)
mentioned to me the price of his commodity [in
offering it for sale]: (Msb, TA:) [and, agreeably
with these explanations,] Kr says that السَّوْمُ signifies العَرْضُ [i. e. the act of offering, &c.]: (M,
TA:) or سُمْتُ بِالسِّلْعَةِ, inf. n. سَوْمٌ (M, K) and
سُوَامٌ, with damm; (K, TK; [in the former only
said to be syn. with سَوْمٌ in selling and buying;])
and ↓ سَاوَمْتُ, (M, K,) inf. n. سِوَامٌ; (TA;) and
بِهَا ↓ اِسْتَمْتُ and عَلَيْهَا; signify غَالَيْتُ [which
means I offered the commodity for sale, mentioning its price, and was exorbitant in my demand:
and also I purchased the commodity for a dear,
or an excessive, price: and both these meanings
are app. here intended]: (M, K, TA:) and in like
manner, السِّلْعَةَ ↓ اِسْتَمْتُهُ [I offered to him the
commodity for sale, &c.: and I purchased of
him the commodity, &c.]: (TA:) or, as some
say, (so in the TA, but in the M and K “ and,”)
this last, as also عَلَى السِّلْعَةِ, ↓ اِسْتَمْتُهُ, means
↓ سَأَلْتُهُ سَوْمَهَا [i. e. I asked him the price at which
the commodity was to be sold]: (M, K, TA:)
and سَامَنِيهَا, (M,) or ↓ سَاوَمَنِيهَا, (TA, [but the
former is app. the right,]) means ↓ ذَكَرَ لِى سَوْمَهَا
[i. e. he mentioned to me the price at which it was
to be sold]: (M, TA:) you say also, عَلَيْهِ ↓ اِسْتَمْتُ
بِسِلْعَتِى when you mention the price of the commodity [i. e. it means I mentioned to him the
price at which I would sell my commodity]: and
you say, مِنِّى سِلْعَتِى ↓ اِسْتَامَ when he is the person
who offers to thee the price [i. e. it means he
offered to me a price for my commodity; or he
sought to obtain from me the sale of my commodity
by offering a price for it]: (TA:) and عَلَىَّ ↓ اِسْتَامَ
he contended [by bidding] against me in a sale:
(S, * PS:) or عَلَىَّ السِّلْعَةَ ↓ اِسْتَامَ, which means
استام عَلَى سَوْمِى [i. e. he sought to obtain the sale
of the commodity in opposition to me, or to my
seeking it]. (Msb. [See also 3.]) Hence, [Mo-
hammad is related to have said,] لَا يَسُومُ الرَّجُلُ عَلَى
سَوْمِ أَخِيهِ, (Mgh,) or لايسوم أَحَدُكُمْ على سوم
اخيه, (Msb,) i. e. [The man, or any one of you,]
shall not purchase [in opposition to his brother]:
(Mgh, Msb:) and it may mean shall not sell; the
case being that of a man's offering to the purchaser his commodity for a certain price, and
another's then saying, “I have the like thereof
for less than this price: ” so that the prohibition
relates in common to the seller and the buyer:
(M:) and the saying is also related otherwise, i. e.
↓ لَايَسْتَامُ, meaning shall not purchase. (Mgh.)
And it is said in a trad., نَهَى عَنِ السَّوْمِ قَبْلَ طُلُوعِ
الشَّمْسِ, meaning, accord. to Aboo-Is-hák, أَنْ
بِسِلْعَتِهِ ↓ يُسَاوِمَ [i. e. He (Mohammad) forbade
the offering a commodity for sale before the rising
of the sun]; because that is a time in which God
is to be praised, and one should not be diverted
by other occupation: or, he says, it may mean
the pasturing of camels; because, before sunrise,
when the pasturage is moist with dew, it occasions
a fatal disease. (TA.) You say also, سُمْتُكَ
حَسَنَةً ↓ بَعِيرَكَ سِيمَةً [I have mentioned to thee a
good price for thy camel]. (S.) And فِيهِ ↓ اِسْتَامَ
غَالِيَةً ↓ سِيمَةً [He demanded for it a dear price].
(TA in art. حثر.) And سَامَهُ بِعَمَلٍ [He made to
him an offer of working, mentioning the rate of
payment; or bargained, or contracted, with him
for work]. (K in art. عمل. [See also 3.]) ―
-b2-
The Arabs also say, عَرَضَ عَلَىَّ سَوْمَ عَالَّةٍ [He
offered to me in the manner of offering water to
camels taking a second draught]; meaning like
the saying of the vulgar, عَرْضَ سَابِرِىٍّ: (Ks, TA:
[see art. سبر:]) a prov. applied to him who offers
to thee that of which thou hast no need. (Sh, TA.
[See also art. عل; and see Freytag's Arab. Prov.
ii. 84.]) ―
-b3-  And you say, سَامَهُ الأمْرَ, (M, K,)
aor. as above, (TA,) inf. n. سَوْمٌ, (M, TA,) He
imposed upon him, or made him to undertake, the
affair, as a task, or in spite of difficulty or
trouble or inconvenience; or he ordered, required,
or constrained, him to do the thing, it being difficult or troublesome or inconvenient: (M, K, TA:)
or he brought upon him the affair, or event;
(Zj, M, K, TA;) as also ↓ سَوَّمَهُ, (K,) inf. n. تَسْوِيمٌ:
(TA:) or he endeavoured to induce him, or incited him, or made him, to do, or to incur, the
affair, or event: (Sh, TA:) it is mostly used in
relation to punishment, and evil, (Zj, M, K, TA,)
and wrong-doing: and hence the saying in the
Kur [ii. 46 and vii. 137 and xiv. 6], يَسُومُونَكُمْ
سُوْءَ الْعَذَابِ They bringing upon you evil punish-
ment or torment: (Zj, M, TA:) or seeking, or
desiring, for you evil punishment: (Ksh and Bd
in ii. 46:) or endeavouring to induce you to incur
it: (Ksh ibid.:) from سَامَهُ خَسْفًا [expl. by what
here follows]. (Ksh and Bd ibid.) You say,
سُمْتُهُ خَسْفًا I brought upon him خَسْف [i. e.
wrong, or wrong treatment, as expl. in the Ksh
and by Bd ubi suprà]: or I endeavoured to
induce him to incur it (أَرَدْتُهُ عَلَيْهِ): (S:) [see also
خَسْفٌ: and سُمْتُهُ خُطَّةَ خَسْفٍ; expl. in art. خط:]
and سِيمَ الخَسْفَ He was constrained to incur, or
to do, what is termed الخَسْف [meaning abasement
or ignominy, or that which was difficult]: (TA:)
and سُمْتُهُ ذُلًّا I abased him. (Msb.)
-A3-  سَامَهُ, aor.

not quitting it. (M, * TA.)

K,) or the camels, (M,) [sometimes meaning] to
the pasturage, to pasture where they would. (TA.
[See also 4.]) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] سوّمهُ means خَلَّاهُ وَسَوْمَهُ,
(AZ, S, M, K,) i. e. [He left him] to do as he
pleased; namely, a man. (AZ, S, K. [In the
CK is a mistranscription in this place, before
mentioned: see 1, fourth sentence.]) Whence the
prov., عَبْدٌ وَسُوِّمَ A slave, and he has been left to
do as he pleases. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And سَوَّمْتُ فُلَانًا فِى
مَالِى I gave such a one authority to judge, give
judgment, pass sentence, or decide judicially, respecting my property. (AO, S: and in like
manner سَوّمهُ فِى مَالِهِ is expl. in the M and K.)
And سَوَّمْتُهُ أَمْرِى I made him to have the ordering and deciding of my affair, or case, to do what
he would; like سَوَّفْتُهُ أَمْرِى. (TA in art. سوف.)
―
-b4-  And سوّم عَلَى القَوْمِ He urged his horses [خَيْلَهُ
being understood] against the people, or party,

السِّلْعَةِ (TA) [and بِالسِّلَعَةِ agreeably with what

pleased (see 1)]: (Msb:) and [in like manner]
الإِبِلَ ↓ سُمْتُ I left the camels to pasture [by
themselves where they pleased]. (Th, TA. [See
also 2.]) Hence, in the Kur [xvi. 10], فِيهِ تُسِيمُونَ
(S) Upon which ye pasture your beasts. (Jel.)
―
-b2-  [And accord. to Freytag, اسام occurs in the
Deewán of Jereer as meaning He urged a horse

see 1, in ten places.
سَامٌ Death: (IAar, S, M, Mgh:) and سَامَةٌ
[as its n. un.] a death: (IAar, TA:) but the
former [signifies the same in Pers., and] is said to
be not Arabic. (TA.) It is related in a trad.,
respecting the salutation of the Jews, that they
used to say, السَّامُ عَلَيْكُمْ [Death come upon you,
instead of السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ]; and that he [i. e. Mo-
hammad] used to reply, عَلَيْكُمْ; accord. to the
generality of the relaters, وَعَلَيْكُمْ, but correctly
without the و, because the و implies participation:
and it is related of 'Áïsheh that she used to say
to them, عَلَيْكُمُ السَّأْمُ وَالذَّأْمُ وَاللَّعْنَةُ, as mentioned
in art. سأم: (TA:) the Jews are also related to
have said [to the Muslims], عَلَيْكُمُ السَّامُ الدَّامُ
meaning المَوْتُ الدَّائِمُ. (TA in art. دوم: see دَائِمٌ
in that art.)
-A2-  Also A kind of tree, of which are
made the masts (أَدْقَال [pl. of دَقَلٌ]) of ships:
(Kr, M, TA:) accord. to Sh, (TA,) the [tree called]
خَيْزُرَان. (K, TA. [And accord. to some copies
of the K, سَامَةٌ also has this signification, and the
signification expl. in the sentence here next following: but accord. to the text of the K as given
in the TA, وَالسَّامَةُ has been erroneously substistituted in the copies above referred to for وَالسَّاقَةُ,
which, by reason of what precedes it, means that
سَامَةٌ also signifies the same as سَاقَةٌ; and if the
former reading were right, the context in the K
would imply that السامة is also the name of a son
of Noah, which is incorrect; the name of that son
being only سَامٌ.])
-A3-  Also A [hollow, or cavity,
in the ground, such as is called] نُقْرَة, in which
water remains, or stagnates, and collects. (K.
[For the verb in this explanation, which is
written يُنْقَعُ in the CK and in my MS. copy of
the K, I read يَنْقَعُ.])
-A4-  Also a pl. [or rather coll.
gen. n.] of which the sing. [or n. un.] is سَامَةٌ:
(M, K:) the former signifies Veins of gold: and
the latter, a single vein thereof: (S:) or the
latter, a vein in a mountain, differing from its
[general] nature; (M, K;) if running from east
to west, not failing of its promise to yield silver:
(M:) or the former, (M,) or latter, (K, TA,)
gold, and silver; (M, K, TA;) accord. to As and
IAar: (M, TA:) or, as some say, an ingot of
gold, and of silver: (TA:) or veins of gold, and
of silver, in the stone [or rock]: (M, K:) En-Nábighah El-Jaadee, (M,) or Edh-Dhubyánee,
(TA,) uses السام as meaning silver; for he likens
thereto a woman's front teeth in respect of their
whiteness: (M, TA:) and Aboo-Sa'eed says that
silver is called in Pers. سِيمْ, and in Ar. سَامٌ:
(TA:) but the meaning most commonly known
is gold. (M, TA.) A poet says, (M,) namely,
Keys Ibn-El-Khateem, (S,)
لَوَ انَّكَ تُلْقِى حَنْظَلًا فَوْقَ بَيْضِنَا
تَدَحْرَجَ عَنْ ذِى سَامِهِ المُتَقَارِبِ
(S, M,) [i. e. If thou threwest colocynths upon
our helmets, they would roll along from what is
gilded thereof, they being near together: لَوَ انَّكَ
is for لَوْ أَنَّكَ: and] the ه in سَامِهِ relates to the
بيض [which are described as] gilded therewith:
(S:) the poet is describing the party as being
close together in fight, so that colocynths, notwithstanding their smoothness and the evenness
of their parts, if they fell upon their heads, would
not reach the ground. (Th, S, * M.)
سَوْمٌ [is originally an inf. n.: see 1, passim:
-A2-
and is also used as a subst. signifying The price
of any commodity, or article of merchandise; like
↓ سِيمَةٌ and ↓ سُومَةٌ]. You say, سَأَلْتُهُ سَوْمَهَا, and
ذَكَرَ لِى سَوْمَهَا, referring to a سِلْعَة [or commodity]: see 1, in the former half of the paragraph. And حَسَنَةً ↓ سُمْتُكَ بَعِيرَكَ سِيمَةً, and اِسْتَامَ
غَالِيَةً ↓ فِيهِ سِيمَةً: see again 1, in the latter half of
the paragraph. And ↓ إِنَّهُ لَغَالِى السِّيمَةِ (S, M, K)
and ↓ السُّومَةِ, meaning السَّوْمِ [i. e. Verily it is
dear in price]. (M, K.) ↓ سِيمَةٌ and ↓ سُومَةٌ are
both substs. from سَامَ as used in the phrase سَامَنِى
الرَّجُلُ بِسِلْعَتِهِ [and the like]; (TA;) syn. with
قِيمَةٌ. (Har p. 435 in explanation of the former.)
سَامَةٌ [as n. un. of سَامٌ: see the latter, first sentence, and last but one.
-A2-  Also] A حَفْر, (M, and
so in copies of the K,) or حُفْرَة, (K accord. to the
TA,) [i. e. hollow dug in the ground, app. to be
filled with water for cattle,] by a well (عَلَى رَكِيَّةٍ):
its pl. is سِيَمٌ [originally سِوَمٌ]: and you say,
↓ أَسَامَهَا, (M, K, TA,) inf. n. إِسَامَةٌ, meaning He
dug it [i. e. the سامة]. (TA.)
-A3-  Also i. q. سَاقَةٌ
[q. v.], (K, accord. to the TA, [as mentioned
above, see سَامٌ,]) on the authority of IAar. (TA.)
سُومَةٌ; see سَوْمٌ, in three places.
-A2-  Also, (S,
M, K,) and ↓ سِيمَةٌ (M, K) and ↓ سِيمَى, also
written سِيمَا, (S, M, K, TA, but omitted in some
copies of the K,) and ↓ سِيمَآءُ and ↓ سِيمِيَآءُ, (S, M,
K,) the last mentioned by As, (TA,) [and it
occurs with tenween by poetic license, being properly like كِبْرِيَآءُ, a rare form, q. v.,] A mark,
sign, token, or badge, by which a thing is known,
(S, * M, K,) or by which the good is known from
the bad: (TA:) accord. to J, (TA,) the سُومَة is
a mark, &c., that is put upon a sheep or goat,
and such as is used in war or battle; (S, TA;)
whence the verb تَسَوَّمَ [q. v.]: (S:) and accord.
to IAar the ↓ سِيمَة is a mark upon the wool of
sheep; and its pl. is سِيَمٌ: [see also سِمَةٌ, in art.
وسم:] accord. to IDrd, one says, ↓ عَلَيْهِ سِيمَى
حَسَنَةً, meaning Upon him, or it, is a good mark
&c.; and it is from وَسَمْتُ, aor. أَسِمُ; being originally وِسْمَى; the و being transposed, and
changed into ى because of the kesreh before it:
(TA:) this form occurs in the Kur [xlviii. 29],
where it is said, سِيمَا هُمْ فِى وُجُوهِهِمْ [Their mark
is upon their faces; and in several other places
thereof]. (S.)
سِيمَةٌ: see سَوْمٌ, in five places:
-A2-  and see also
سُومَةٌ, in two places. [For the meanings “ pactus ”
and “ pastum missus,” assigned to it by Golius,
as from the S, and copied by Freytag, I find no
foundation.]
سِيمَى, also written سِيمَا: see سُومَةٌ, in two
places.
سِيمَآءُ: see سُومَةٌ.
سِيمِيَآءُ: see سُومَةٌ. ―
-b2-  [In the present day it is
applied to Natural magic: from the Pers. سِيمْيَا.]

-A2-  Also Two small hollows
(نُقْرَتَانِ) beneath the eye of the horse. (K.)

“ Malum ” (an evil, &c.).]
سُوَامٌ [The offering a commodity for sale, &c.:
see 1.
-A2-  Also] A certain bird. (K.)
لَاسِيَّمَا: see art. سوى.
سَائِمٌ [Going, or going away, engaged, or occupied, in seeking, or in seeking for or after, or in
seeking to find and take or to get, a thing: (see 1,
first sentence:)] going away at random, or roving,
wherever he will. (TA.) And [particularly], (S,)
as also ↓ سَوَامٌ (As, S, M, K) and سَائِمَةٌ, (As, S, M,
Mgh, Msb, K,) Cattle, (مَالٌ, S, TA, or مَاشِيَةٌ,
Mgh, Msb,) or camels, (As, M, K, TA,) and
sheep or goats, (TA,) pasturing (S, M, Mgh,
Msb, K, TA) by themselves (Msb) where they
please; (TA;) or sent forth to pasture, and not
fed with fodder among the family [to whom they
belong]; (As, Mgh, TA;) or pasturing in the
deserts, left to go and pasture where they will:
(TA:) the pl. of سَائِمٌ and of سَائِمَةٌ is سَوَائِمُ: (S:)
the pass. part. n. مُسَامٌ is not used. (Msb.) It is
said in a trad., فِى سَائِمَةِ الغَنَمِ زَكَاةٌ [In the case
of pasturing sheep or goats, there is a poor-rate].
(TA.) And in another trad., السَّائِمَةُ جُبَارٌ, i. e.
The beast (دَابَّة) that is sent away into its place of
pasture, if it hurt a human being, the injury committed by it is a thing for which no mulct is
exacted. (TA.) And it is related in a trad. respecting the emigration to Abyssinia, that the
Nejáshee said to those who had emigrated to his
country, اُمْكُثُوا فَأَنْتُمْ سُيُومٌ بِأَرَضِى, i. e. [Tarry ye,
and ye will be] secure [in my land]: IAth says
that thus it is explained: and سيوم is [said to be]
an Abyssinian word: it is related also with fet-h
to the س: and some say that سُيُومٌ is pl. of سَائِمٌ
[like as شُهُودٌ is said to be of شَاهِدٌ]; i. e., ye shall
rove (تَسُومُونَ) in my country like the sheep, or
goats, pasturing where they please (كَالغَنَمِ السَّائِمَةِ),
no one opposing you: (TA:) or, as some relate
the trad., it is شُيُومٌ. (TA in art. شيم.)
[
مَسَامٌ A place where cattle pasture by themselves where they please; a place where they rove
about, pasturing: like أَرْضٌ مُسْتَامَةٌ. ―
-b2-  Freytag
explains it as meaning A place of passage: ―
-b3-
and A quick passage: from the Deewán el-Hudhaleeyeen.]
مَسَامَةٌ A wide and thick piece of wood at the
bottom of the قَاعِدَتَانِ [or two side-posts] of the
door. (K.) ―
-b2-  And A staff in the fore part of
the [women's camel-vehicle called] هَوْدَج. (K.)
الخَيْلُ المُسَوَّمَةُ means The pastured horses: (S,
Msb, TA:) or the horses sent forth with their
riders upon them: (AZ, Az, Msb, TA:) or it
means, (TA,) or means also, (S, Msb,) the marked
horses; (S, Msb, TA;) marked by a colour
differing from the rest of the colour; or by
branding: (TA:) or the horses of goodly make.

مُسَوَّمِينَ, in the Kur [iii. 121], may mean, accord.
to Akh, either Marked [by the colours, or the
like, of their horses, so as to be distinguished from
others], or sent forth; and is thus with ي and ن
[because applied to rational beings, namely, angels,
and] because the horses were marked, or sent
forth, and upon them were their riders. (S.) ―
-b3-
And حِجَارَةً مِنْ طِينٍ مُسَوَّمَةً عِنْدَ رَبِّكَ, (S, * M,
K, *) in the Kur [li. 33 and 34], (S, M,) means
[Stones of baked clay] having upon them the
semblance of seals [impressed in the presence of
thy Lord], (S, K, Er-Rághib,) in order that they
may be known to be from God: (Er-Rághib:)
or marked (Zj, M, Bd, K, Jel) with whiteness
and redness, (Zj, M, K,) as is related on the
authority of El-Hasan, (Zj, M,) or with a mark
whereby it shall be known that they are not of
the stones of this world (M, K) but of the things
wherewith God inflicts punishment, (M,) or
[each] with the name of him upon whom it is to
be cast: (Jel:) or sent forth: (Bd, TA:) but
Er-Rághib says that the first is the proper way of
explaining it. (TA.)
