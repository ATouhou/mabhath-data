سسبسَاسَبٌ and ↓ سَيْسَبٌ, (M, K,) i. q. سَبْسَبٌ, with
two ب s, (L, TA,) the second of which is commonly pronounced سِيسب, and by some سيسم,
(TA,) A kind of tree, (M, K,) a kind of lofty
tree, (TA,) of which arrows are made, (M, K,
TA,) and bows. (TA.) In the saying of Rubeh,
↓ رَاحَتْ وَرَاحَ كَعِصِىِّ السَّيْسَابٌ
[She went, and he went, like the rods of the
seysáb, (of which see another reading voce
سَبْسَبٌ, in art. سب,) meaning, like arrows], it
may be that السيساب is a dial. var. of السَّيْسَب, or
it may be that the ا is added for the sake of the
rhyme like as it is in العَقْرَاب in a verse cited in
art. عقرب. (M. [Accord. to the K and TA,
↓ السَّيْسَاب is used by Ru-beh for السَّيْسَبَان: but
this is evidently a mistake.])
سَيْسَبٌ: see the preceding paragraph: ―
-b2-  and
see also سَيْسَبَانٌ.
سَيْسَبَا, and سَيْسَبَى, and سَيْسَبًى, and سَيْسَبَآءُ:
see the paragraph that next follows.
سَيْسَبَانٌ and ↓ سَيْسَبَى, (K,) or the former and
↓ سَيْسَبَآءُ, which is mentioned by Th, (M,) A
kind of tree; (M, K;) accord. to AHn, it grows
from its seeds, and becomes tall, but does not
endure the winter; it has leaves like those of the
دِفْلَى [q. v.], beautiful; people sow it in the
gardens, desiring its beauty; and it has a produce like the oblong pericarps (خَرَائِط) of sesame,
but thinner: (M, TA:) AHn adds that, when its
pericarps dry, it makes a rustling sound (a sound
such as is termed خَشْخَشَة) [in the wind], like the
[species of cassia called] عِشْرِق: (TA:) [the
sesbania Aegytiaca of Persoon; æschynomene
sesban of Linn.; (Delile, Flor. Aegypt. Illustr.,
no. 682;) dolichos sesban of Forskål (in his Flora
Aegypt. Arab, p. lxx., no. 362):] AHn further
says, وَحَكَى الفَرَّآءُ فِيهِ سَيْسَبًا: (M, TA:) [this may
perhaps mean that Fr has mentioned, as a var. of
this word, ↓ سَيْسَبٌ, as it is in the accus. case:
but I think that the right reading is ↓ سَيْسَبًى, and
also سَيْسَبَى, (which last has been mentioned
above on the authority of the K,) for it is immediately added in the TA, “it is masc. and
fem.,” app. indicating that it is with, and without, tenween: then it is there further and strangely
added, “it is brought from India: ”] a rájiz uses
the form ↓ السَّيْسَبَا, at the end of a verse, for
السَّيْسَبَانَ, necessarily eliding [the ن for the sake
of the rhyme]. (M, TA.)
سَيْسَابٌ: see the first paragraph, in two places.
