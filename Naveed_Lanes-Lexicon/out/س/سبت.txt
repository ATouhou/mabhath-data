and ceased, or abstained, from works: (TA:)

was, or became, motionless: (S, TA:) Az says
that سَبَتَ in the first of these senses is not known
in the language of the Arabs: (TA:) [but J says
that] the primary signification of سُبَاتٌ is “ rest: ”
and hence the former of these verbs signifies he slept.

انسبت [It became cut off, interrupted, put
a stop to, or put an end to, or it ceased: meanings
indicated in this art. in the M and TA. ―
-b2- ] It
became extended: (K:) or long and extended,
together with softness. (TA.) It is said in a

-b2-  السَّبْتُ, (M, K,)
or يَوْمُ السَّبْتِ, (S, Msb,) [The sabbath, or Saturday;] one of the days of the week; (M, K;) the
seventh of those days: (M:) so called because
the creation commenced on the first day of the
week and continued to [the end of] Friday, and
on the سبت there was no creation, the work
having ceased thereon: or, as some say, because
the Jews ceased thereon from work, and the
management of affairs: (M, TA:) or because the
days [of the week] end thereon: (S, TA:) Az
says that he errs who asserts it to have been so
called because God commanded the Children of
Israel to rest thereon, and that God created the
heavens and the earth in six days, whereof the
last was Friday, then rested, and the work ceased,
and therefore He named the seventh day يوم
السبت: this, he says, is an error, because [he
affirms that] سَبَتَ as meaning “ he rested ” is not
known in the language of the Arabs, but signifies
قَطَعَ; and rest cannot be attributed to God,
because He knows not fatigue, and rest is only
after fatigue and work: (TA:) the pl. [of pauc.]
is أَسْبُتٌ and [of mult.] سُبُوتٌ: (S, M, Msb, K:)
it has no dim. (Sb, S in art. امس.) ―
-b3-  سَبْتٌ also
means A week; from the سَبْت to the سَبْت [i. e.
from the sabbath to the sabbath]: so in the saying, in a trad., فَمَا رَأَيْنَا الشَّمْسَ سَبْتًا [And we saw
not the sun for a week]: as when one says
“ twenty autumns ” meaning “ twenty years: ” or
it means in this instance a space of time, whether
short or long. (TA.) ―
-b4-  I. q. بُرْهَةٌ [i. e. A space,
or period, or a long space or period,] (M, K, TA)
مِنَ الدَّهْرِ [of time]: (TA:) so in the saying,
أَقَمْتُ سَبْتًا [I remained, staid, dwelt, or abode, a
space, or a long space, of time]; as also ↓ سَبْتَةً
and ↓ سَنْبَتًا and ↓ سَنْبَتَتًا. (M, K.) ―
-b5-  And i. q. دَهْرٌ
[meaning Time; or a long time; or a space, or
period, of time, whether long or short; &c.]; as
also ↓ سُبَاتٌ. (S, M, K.) And [hence] ↓ اِبْنَا سُبَاتٍ
means (assumed tropical:)  The night and the day: (S, M, K:) Ibn
Ahmar says,
وَكُنَّا وَهُمْ كَابْنَىْ سُبَاتٍ تَفَرَّقَا
سِوًى ثُمَّ كَانَا مُنْجِدًا وَتَهَامِيَا
[And we were, with them, like the night and the
day that parted asunder alike, then became one
going towards Nejd and one going towards
Tihámeh]: (S, K:) such, they say, is the meaning: (S:) or, as IB says, on the authority of
Aboo-Jaafar Mohammad Ibn-Habeeb, ابنا سبات
were two men, one of whom saw the other in a
dream, and then one of them awoke in Nejd, and
the other in Tihámeh: or they were two brothers,
one of whom went to the east to see where the
sun rose, and the other to the west to see where
it set. (L, TA.)
-A2-  Also A certain pace (S, M,
K) of camels: (S, K:) or a quick pace: (TA:)
or i. q. عَنَقٌ [q. v.]: (AA, S:) or a pace exceeding
that termed العَنَقُ. (M.)
-A3-  A swift, or an excellent, horse; (K, TA;) that runs much. (TA.)

illnatured, and bold, or daring. (K) ―

cunning, i. e. possessing intelligence, or sagacity,
or intelligence mixed with craft and forecast;

the same. (K, TA.) ―
-b4-  A man who sleeps much;
(K;) i. e. كَثِيرُ السُّبَاتِ. (TA.) See also مَسْبُوتٌ.

سُبْتٌ A certain plant, resembling the خِطْمِىّ
[or marsh-mallow]; (Kr, M, K;) as also ↓ سَبْتٌ,
(K [there expressly said to be with fet-h],) or
↓ سِبْتٌ: (M [so written in a copy of that work]:)
said to be a certain plant used for tanning.
(MF.) See the next paragraph.
سِبْتٌ The hides, or skins, of oxen; (M, K;)
whether tanned or not tanned: so some say:
(M:) or (so accord. to the M, in the K and TA
“ and,” but the و is omitted in the CK,) any
tanned hide; (As, AA, M, K;) said to be so
called [because the tanning removes the hair,]
from السَّبْتُ, “the act of shaving: ” (AA, TA:)
or such. as is tanned with قَرَظ [q. v.]: (M, K:)
or only ox-hides tanned: so says AHn on the
authority of As and AZ: (TA:) or ox-hides
tanned with قَرَظ, (S, Mgh,) whereof are made
[the sandals called] ↓ نِعَالٌ سِبْتيَّةٌ: (S) these are
hence thus called: (Mgh:) they are sandals
having no hair upon them: (M, Msb:) or sandals
tanned with قرَظ: (AA, TA:) accord. to Az, they
are thus called because their hair has been shaven
off (سُبِتَ, i. e. حُلِقَ,) and removed by a wellknown process in tanning, (Mgh, * TA,) so that
they are soft; and they are of the sandals of
people that lead a life of ease and softness:
(Mgh:) IAar says that they are thus called
because of their having become soft by the
tanning: accord. to this, they should be called
↓ سَبْتِيَّة; and so accord. to a saying of EdDáwoodee, that they are called in relation to
سُوقُ السَّبْتِ [“ the Market of the Sabbath ”]:
it is also said that they are called in relation to
the ↓ سُبْت, with damm, which is a plant used for
tanning therewith; so that they should be called
↓ سُبْتِيَّة, unless the appellation be an instance of a
rel. n. deviating from its source of derivation [or
unless this plant be also termed سِبْتٌ, as it is
accord. to a copy of the M]: (TA:) see سُبْتٌ.
It is related of the Prophet, that he saw a man
walking among the graves wearing his sandals,
and said, يَا صَاحِبَ السِّبْتَينِ اِخْلَعْ سِبْتَيْكَ [meaning (tropical:)  O wearer of the pair of sandals of سِبْت,
pull off thy pair of sandals of سِبْت]: (S, * TA:)
and accord. to the A, they are thus termed
tropically: it is like the saying “ Such a one
wears wool, and cotton, and silk; ” meaning
“ garments made thereof; ” as is said in the
Nh: but, as some relate it, what he said was,
↓ يَا صَاحِبَ السِّبْتِيَّيْنِ, the last of these words
being a rel. n.; and thus it is found in the handwriting of Az, in his book. (TA.)
سِبِتٌّ, (M, L, K,) like فِلِزٌّ, (TA,) [in a copy
of the M erroneously written سِبْت,] A certain
plant; [anethum graveolens, or dill, of the common garden-species;] an arabicized word, from
[the Pers.] شِبِتّ [or شِبِتْ]: (AHn, M, L:) or
i. q. شِبِتٌّ; both words arabicized from شِوِذْ [or
شِوِدْ]: (K:) asserted by some to be the same as
سَنُّوتٌ [q. v.]: (M, L:) Az says that شِبِتٌّ, the
name of a well-known herb, or leguminous plant,
is an arabicized word; that he had heard the
people of El-Bahreyn call it سِبِتٌّ, with the
unpointed س, and with ت; that it is originally,
in Pers., شِوِذْ; and that it has another dial. var.,
namely, سبط [i. e. سِبِطٌّ]. (El-Jawáleekee, TA.)
سَبْتَةٌ: see سَبْتٌ, in the middle of the paragraph.
-A2-  Also Goats, collectively. (K.)
سَبْتَآءُ A [desert such as is termed] صَحْرَآء:
(AZ, K:) or أَرْضٌ سَبْتَآءُ is like صَحْرَآءُ: or a land
in which are no trees: (M:) and i. q. ↓ مَسْبُوتَةٌ
[i. e. a bare land; as though shorn of its herbage]: (TA:) pl. سَبَاتِىُّ. (M.) ―
-b2-  Also, [in like
manner] a fem. epithet, Having spreading, or
expanded, ears, whether long or short. (K.)
سَبْتِىٌّ One who fasts alone on the سَبْت [i. e.
sabbath, or Saturday]: thus in the saying mentioned by Th, on the authority of IAar, لَا تَكُ
سَبْتِيًّا [Be not thou one who fasts &c.]. (M.)
نِعَالٌ سِبْتِيَّةٌ, and سَبْتِيَّةٌ, and سُبْتِيَّةٌ; and the dual.
of سِبْتِىٌّ, applied to a pair of sandals: see سِبْتٌ,
in four places.
سِبْتَانٌ, with kesr, Foolish, stupid, or of little
sense; (K, TA;) confounded, or perplexed, and
unable to see his right course; without understanding. (TA.)
سُبَاتٌ primarily signifies Rest [like سَبْتٌ]:
(S, Msb:) and hence, sleep: (S, K:) or heavy
sleep: (Msb:) or sleep that is hardly perceptible
(خَفِىّ, M, K, [in some copies of the K, as mentioned by Freytag, خَفِيف, i. e. light,]), like a
swoon: (M:) or the commencement of sleep in
the head [and its continuance] until it reaches
the heart: (Th, M, K:) or the sleep of one who
is sick; i. e. light sleep: (TA:) and ↓ سَبْتٌ signifies the same as سُبَاتٌ. (T, TA.) Hence, in
the Kur [lxxviii. 9, and in like manner the word
is used in xxv. 49], وَجَعَلْنَا نَوْمَكُمْ سُبَاتًا; (S;) i. e.
قَطْعًا; as though a man, when he slept, were cut
off from [the rest of] mankind: (IAar, TA:) or
سبات is when one is cut off, or ceases, from
motion, while the soul still remains in the body;
i. e., the text means, And we have made your
sleep to be rest unto you: (Zj, TA:) or we have
made your sleep to be a cutting off from sensation
and motion, for rest to the animal forces, and
for causing their weariness to cease: or, to be
death: (Bd:) or, to be rest unto your bodies by
the interruption of labour, or work. (Jel.)

سَبُوتٌ A she-camel that goes the pace termed
سَبْتٌ: or constantly going the pace termed
عَنَقٌ. (M.)
سَبَنْتًى, (S, M, K,) as also سَبَنْدًى, (S,) Bold,
or daring; (S, M, K;) as an epithet applied to
anything [i. e. man or brute]: the ى is added to
render it quasi-coordinate to the class of quinqueliteral-radical words, not to denote the fem.
gender, for it receives ة as a termination [to
denote the fem.], becoming سَبَنْتَاةٌ; (S;) and has
tenween. (TA.) A poet applies the fem. epithet
to a she-camel. (S.) ―
-b2-  Also The leopard; (S,
M, K;) so too with ة; (AHeyth, L in art. سبد;)
and so سَبَنْدًى: probably thus called because of
his boldness, or daringness: (S:) or, as some
ay, the lion: fem. with ة: or the fem, signifies a
bold, or daring, lioness: or a she-camel of bold,
or daring, breast; but this last is not of valid
authority: (M:) and a beast of prey [absolutely]:
(L in art. سيد:) pl. سَبَانِتُ; (K, TA;) and some
of the Arabs make سَبَاتِى [or rather سَبَاتٍ] to be
its pl. (TA.) ―
-b3-  The fem. also, applied to a
woman, signifies Sharp in tongue; or clamorous;
or clamorous and foul-tongued; or long-tongued
and vehemently clamorous. (TA.)

[or sabbath]. (TA.)

semblance, of sleep termed] سُبَات [q. v.]: (IAar,
M:) or affected with a swoon: and, applied to a
sick man, prostrated like him who is sleeping,
generally closing his eyes: (S:) or confounded,
or perplexed, and unable to see his right course:
(Msb:) and ↓ سَبْتٌ signifies the same as مَسْبُوتٌ;
as in the saying, cited by As,
يُصْبِحُ مَخْمُورًا وَيُمْسِى سَبْتَا
[He is in the morning affected with the remains
of intoxication, and he is in the evening affected
with sleep, or heavy sleep, &c.]. (T, TA.) ―
-b2-  Also
Dead. (S, K.)
-A2-  رَأْسٌ مَسْبُوتٌ [A head cut off.]
