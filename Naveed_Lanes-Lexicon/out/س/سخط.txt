↓ تسخّط, properly and generally signifies, when
intrans., he expressed, or showed, dislike, displeasure, disapprobation, discontent, or hatred]:
(TA:) he was, or became, angry; (S, Msb, TA;)
and ↓ تسخّط signifies the same; or he became
angered; syn. تَغَضَّبَ. (TA.) You say, سَخِطَ عَلَيْهِ
[He was, or became, displeased, or discontented,
or angry, with him]. (Kur v. 83.) And سَخِطَهُ
He was, or became, displeased, or discontented,

like manner, ↓ أَعْطَاهُ قَلِيلًا فَتَسَخَّطَهُ [He gave him
little and he expressed, or showed, dislike of it,
&c.]: (TA:) and [hence,] عَطَآءَهُ ↓ تَسَخَّطَ He
deemed his gift little, and it did not stand with
him in any stead; expl. by اِسْتَقَلَّهُ وَلَمْ يَقَعْ مِنْهُ
