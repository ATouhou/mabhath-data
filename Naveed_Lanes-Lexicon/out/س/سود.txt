سَيِّد: (K:) or, accord. to Fr, one says, هٰذَا سَيِّدُ
قَوْمِهِ اليَوْمَ [this is the lord, &c., of his people today]; but if you announce that he will be their
سيّد after a little while, you say هُوَ سَائِدُ قَوْمِهِ عَنْ
قَلِيلٍ, and سَيِّدُ: (S:) the fem. of سَيِّدٌ [and of
↓ سَائِدٌ] is with ة: (M, L, Msb:) pl. of سَيِّدٌ, (S,
Msb,) or of ↓ سَائِدٌ, (M, K,) سَادَةٌ (S, M, Msb, K)
and سَيَائِدُ (S, K) and [pl. of سَادَةٌ] سَادَاتٌ: (Msb:)
[J says that] سَادَةٌ is of the measure فَعَلَةٌ, [orinally سَوَدَةٌ,] because سَيِّدٌ is of the measure
فَعِيلٌ; [as has been before mentioned;] and it is
like سَرَاةٌ as pl. of سَرِىٌّ, the only other instance
of the kind; this being shown to be the case by
the fact that سَيِّدٌ has also as a pl. سَيَائِدُ, with ء,
[and with the و changed into ى because it is so
changed in the sing.,] like as أَفِيلٌ has أَفَائِلُ, and
like as تَبِيعٌ has تَبَائِعُ; but the Basrees, who hold
سَيِّدٌ to be of the measure فَيْعِلٌ, say that it becomes
of the measure فَعَلَةٌ in the pl. as though it were
سَائِدٌ, like قَائِدٌ, which has قَادَةٌ as a pl., and like
ذَائِدٌ, which has ذَادَةٌ as a pl.; and they also say
that سَيَائِدُ, with ء, as pl. of سَيِّدٌ, is contr. to
analogy; for by rule it should be without ء. (S.)

-b2-  [In the present day it is also particularly applied to signify, like شَرِيف, Any descendant of the
Prophet.] ―
-b3-  One of the poets has used it in
relation to the jinn, or genii; saying,
يَنْدُبْنَ سَيِّدَهُنَّةْ  جِنٌّ هَبَبْنَ بِلَيْلٍ
[Genii that were roused from their sleep by night,
summoning, or perhaps bewailing and eulogizing
their chief]: Akh says that this is a well-known
verse of the poetry of the Arabs: but it is asserted
by one, or more, likewise deserving of reliance,
that it is of the poetry of El-Weleed [and therefore
post-classical]. (M.) ―
-b4-  And the wild ass is
called (assumed tropical:)  the سَيِّد of his female. (TA.) ―
-b5-  Also,
(Ks, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) and ↓ سِيَّدٌ, (K,) the
latter on the authority of Aboo-'Alee, (TA,)
applied to a he-goat, (assumed tropical:)  Advanced in years: (Ks,
S, M; Mgh, Msb, K:) or in its third year:
(Mgh:) or great, though not advanced in years:
(TA:) or it is of general application, for it occurs
in a trad. applied to the camel and the ox-kind. (M,
TA.) ―
-b6-  And the former also signifies (assumed tropical:)  What is
most eminent, exalted, or noble, of any things:
and is applied by Zj to the Kur-án, because, he
says, it is سَيِّدُ الكَلَامِ (assumed tropical:)  [The paragon of speech].

سِيَّدٌ: see the last sentence but one above.
سُوَيْدٌ the abbreviated dim. of أَسْوَدُ: (S, Mgh,
Msb:) see the latter. ―
-b2-  Also [as a subst., or an
epithet in which the quality of a subst. predominates,] Water; (M, Mgh, L;) as also ↓ أَسْوَدُ:
(M: [but see الأَسْوَدَانِ, voce أَسْوَدُ:]) the former
is [said to be] used in this sense in negative
phrases only: (M, L:) one says, مَاسَقَاهُمْ مِنْ
سُوَيْدٍ قَطْرَةً He gave them not to drink a drop of
water. (M, Mgh, * L.) ―
-b3-  أُمُّ سُوَيْدٍ means The
anus; syn. الاِسْتُ; (K;) [and] so ↓ السُّوَيْدَآءُ.
(M.)
سَوَادَةُ القَلْبِ: see سَوَادٌ, near the beginning
of the paragraph.
سُوَادِىٌّ [or perhaps سَوَادِىٌّ, i. e. “ belonging to
the Sawád of El-'Irák,”] i. q. سِهْرِيزٌ (M) A wellknown sort of dates, (K voce سهريز,) found in
abundance at El-Basrah. (TA ibid.)

-b5-  Also
A certain bird. (M.) ―
-b6-  And Salt tracts (سِبَاخ)
of [plants of the kind called] نَجِيل: Kr explains
it by نِبْتَةٌ [app. a mistranscription for نَبْتَةٌ a
plant]; without describing it. (M.)
سَائِدٌ: see سَيِّدٌ, in the middle of the paragraph,
in three places.
أَسْوَدُ Greater, and greatest, in respect of estimation, rank, or dignity; syn. أَجَلُّ: (S, K:) and,
as some say, more [and most] liberal or bountiful
or munificent: or more [and most] clement or
forbearing. (TA.) One says, هُوَ أَسْوَدُ مِنْ فُلَانٍ
He is greater &c. (أَجَلُّ) than such a one. (S.)
And الأَسْوَدُ مِنَ القَوْمِ means The greatest &c.
(الأَجَلُّ) of the people, or party. (K, TA.)
-A2-
Also Black; i. e. having سَوَاد, (M, * Mgh,)
which is the contr. of بَيَاض: (M, Mgh:) and
↓ أَسْوَدِىٌّ signifies the same as أَسْوَدُ: (Ham p.
379:) [or has an intensive signification, like
أَحْمَرىٌّ:] the fem. of أَسْوَدُ is سَوْدَآءُ: (Mgh, Msb:)
the dim. of أَسْوَدُ is ↓ أُسَيِّدُ, (S, Msb,) and it is
allowable to say ↓ أُسَيْوِدُ, [as is shown by an ex.
voce أَسَكُّ,] meaning [a little black thing; or
blackish, or] approaching to black; (S;) and the
abbreviated dim. is ↓ سُوَيْدٌ: (S, Mgh, Msb:) the
dim. of سَوْدَآءُ is ↓ سُوَيْدَآءُ: (Mgh:) the pl. of أَسْوَدُ
(M, Msb) and of سَوْدَآءُ (Msb) is سُودٌ (M, Msb)
and سُودَانٌ [which latter is especially applied to
human beings]. (M.) السُّودَانُ is said in the R
to denote [The negroes;] that particular people,
or race, who are the most stinking of mankind in
the armpits and sweat, and the more so those who
are eunuchs. (TA.) [It (i. e. السودان) is also
sometimes used for أَرْضُ السُّودَانِ, or بِلَادُ السُّودَانِ,
(The land, or the country, of the negroes,) or the
like: it is thus used in the TA voce سَمْغَرَةُ.] And
the epithet أَسْوَدُ is also applied by the Arabs to a
thing that is أَخْضَر [i. e. green]; because it
appears to be thus at a distance. (Msb. [See
أَخْضَرُ: and see حَدِيقَةٌ دَهْمَآءُ and مُدْهَامَّةٌ, voce
أَدْهَمُ.]) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] أَسْوَدُ القَلْبِ and سَوْدَآؤُهُ: see
سَوَادٌ. ―
-b3-  [And السَّوْدَآءُ The black bile; one of the
four humours of the body; of which the others
are the yellow bile (الصَّفْرَآءُ), the blood (الدَّمُ),
and the phlegm (البَلْغَمُ).] ―
-b4-  أَسْوَدُ as opposed to
أَحْمَرُ [and meaning The Arab race, and also,
accord. to some, in this case also, the black]: see
أَحْمَرُ, in two places. ―
-b5-  As applied to a certain
bird: see سُودَانِيَّةٌ, in two places. ―
-b6-  Also, as a
subst., (S,) or an epithet in which the quality of a
subst. predominates, (Sh, M,) so that it is used as
a subst., (Sh, TA,) but imperfectly decl., (TA,)
(tropical:)  A great serpent, (S, M, K,) in which is blackness: (S, M:) the worst and greatest and most
noxious of serpents, than which there is none more
daring, for sometimes it opposes itself to a company of travellers, and follows the voice, and it
is that which seeks retaliation, and he who is
bitten by it will not escape death: (Sh, TA:) it
is pluralized as a subst., (Sh, S, M,) its pl. being
أَسَاوِدُ (S, M) and أَسَاوِيدُ and ↓ أَسْوَدَاتٌ: (M:)
were it an epithet [used as such], its pl. would be
سُودٌ: it is also called أَسْوَدُ سَالِحٌ, because it casts
off its slough every year: you do not say أَسْوَدُ
سَالِخٍ: (S:) the female is called ↓ أَسْوَدَةٌ, (S, M,)
which is extr.; (M;) and to this the epithet
سَالِخَةٌ is not applied. (S.) ―
-b7-  الأَسْوَدَانِ means
(assumed tropical:)  The serpent and the scorpion; (Sh, Mgh, Msb,
K;) which are to be killed during prayer: (Sh,
Mgh, Msb:) so called by the attribution of predominance [to the former]. (Sh, TA.) ―
-b8-  And
(tropical:)  Dates and water; (El-Ahmar, As, S, M, A,
Mgh, Msb, K;) both together being thus called
by a term which properly applies to one only,
[accord. to some,] for [they say that] الأَسْوَدُ alone
signifies dates, not water, and especially, or
mostly, the dates of El-Medeeneh; and in like
manner, Aboo-Bekr and 'Omar together are
called العُمَرَانِ; and the sun and the moon
together, القَمَرَانِ: (TA:) or, as some say, it
means water and milk; and is applied by a rájiz
to water and the herb called الفَثّ, of [the grain
of] which bread is made, and is eaten [in time of
dearth or drought]. (M, L.) See also سُوَيْدٌ. ―
-b9-
Also (assumed tropical:)  The حَرَّة [or tract strewn with black and
crumbling stones] and night: (S, M, L:) so called
because of their blackness. (M, L.) A party came
as guests to Muzebbid El-Medenee, and he said
to them, “There is nothing for you with us but
the أَسْوَدَانِ: ” and they replied, “Verily therein
is a sufficiency: dates and water: ” but he said,
“ I meant not that: I only meant the حَرَّة and
the night. ” (S, M.) And as to the saying of
'Áïsheh, that she was with the Prophet when
they had no food, but only the أَسْوَدَانِ, which is
expl. by the lexicologists as meaning dates and
water, [and thus by Mtr in the Mgh, ISd says,]
in my opinion she only meant the حَرَّة and night.
(M.) ―
-b10-  هُوَ أَسْوَدُ الكَبِدِ [lit. He is black-livered]
means (tropical:)  he is an enemy: (A, TA:) and سُودُ الأَكْبَادِ
means (tropical:)  enemies. (M, A.) ―
-b11-  You say also,
جَآءَ فُلَانٌ بِغَنَمِهِ سُودَ البُطُونِ, and, in like manner,
حُمْرَ الكُلَى, both meaning (tropical:)  Such a one brought
his sheep, or goats, in a lean, or an emaciated,
state. (As, S, and A in art. حمر.) ―
-b12-  And
رَمَى بِسَهْمِهِ الأَسْوَدِ (tropical:)  He shot with his lucky
arrow, (A, K,) that was smeared with blood,
(A,) by means of which he looked for good
fortune, (K, TA,) because he had shot with it
and hit the object shot at, (TA,) or as though it
were black (K, TA) with blood, (TA,) or by its
having been much handled. (K, TA.) ―
-b13-  And
كَلَّمْتُهُ فَمَا رَدَّ عَلَىَّ سَوْدَآءَ وَلَا بَيْضَآءَ (tropical:)  I spoke to
him, and he did not return to me a bad word nor
a good one: (S, L:) or a single word. (A.) ―
-b14-
وَطْأَةٌ سَوْدَآءُ means (assumed tropical:)  A footstep, or footprint,
that is becoming effaced: a recent one is termed
حَمْرَآءُ. (S.) ―
-b15-  السَّوْدَآءُ (assumed tropical:)  Cultivated, or planted,
land; opposed to البَيْضَآءُ [q. v.]. (TA in art. بيض
[See also سَوْدَةٌ.]) ―
-b16-  [But سَنَةٌ سَوْدَآءُ means (assumed tropical:)  A
very severe year; more severe than such as is
termed حَمْرَآءُ; which is more severe than the
بَيْضآء, and still more so than the شَهْبَآء: see
arts. شهب and حمر.] ―
-b17-  الحَبَّةُ السَّوْدَآءُ, said in a
trad. to be a remedy for every disease except
death, (TA,) i. q. الشُّونِيزُ [q. v.], (K,) as also
↓ السُّوَيْدَآءُ, (TA,) [i. e.] this latter signifies حَبَّةُ
الشُّونِيزِ, (M,) or properly الشِّينِيز, for thus the
Arabs called it accord. to IAar: or, as some say,
i. q. الحَبَّةُ الخَضْرَآءُ [q. v. in art. حب], because the
Arabs [often] call black أَخْضَر, and green أَسْوَد.
(TA.)
-A3-  It is also used as an epithet denoting
excess; but as such is anomalous, being formed
from a verb whence the simple epithet is of the
measure أَفْعَلُ: so in the saying, أَسْوَدُ مِنْ حَلَكِ
الغُرَابِ [Blacker than the blackness, or intense
blackness, of the crow, or raven: see حَلَكٌ].

بَيَاضٌ; and see Har p. 286.])
