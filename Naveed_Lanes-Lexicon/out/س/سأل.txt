سأل1
سَأَلَهُ (S, M, K) with كَذَا following it, and
سَأَلَهُ عَنْ كَذَا and بِكَذَا, (S, * K,) aor. يَسْأَلُ, (M,)
inf. n. سُؤَالٌ and مَسْأَلَةٌ, (S, M, K,) which latter is
also pronounced مَسَلَةٌ, without the hemzeh, (TA,)
and تَسْآلٌ and سَآلَةٌ, (M, K,) and سَأَلَةٌ or سَأْلَةٌ,
(accord. to different copies of the K, the former
of these two accord. to the TA, [and it appears
from a statement that will be found below, voce
سُؤْلٌ, that one of these is correct, but in an excel-lent copy of the M, in the place thereof, I find,
and ↓ سَآءَلَهُ, as a verb, doubly trans., first thus by
itself, and secondly by means of عَنْ, as shown by
an ex. in a verse cited below, (see 3,) and this
also is correct,]) all [sometimes] signify the same,
(S, * K,) i. e. He asked him such a thing; or
asked him, interrogated him, questioned him, or
inquired of him, respecting such a thing: but
عن كذا is more common than بكذا: when سَأَلَ
means the asking, or demanding, of property, it
is trans. [only] by itself or by means of مِنْ [so
that you say سَأَلَهُ كَذَا and سَأَلَ مِنْهُ كَذَا meaning he asked, or demanded, of him such a thing]:
(Er-Rághib, TA:) and one says also سَالَ, aor.
يَسَالُ, (Akh, S, M, Msb, K,) like خَافَ, aor. يَخَافُ;
(Msb, K;) which is of the dial. of Hudheyl; the
medial letter of this being originally و, as is shown
by the phrase, mentioned by AZ, هُمَا يَتَسَاوَلَانِ:
(TA:) [respecting this dial. var., see what follows:] the imperative (S, Msb, K, TA;) of سَأَلَ
(S, Msb, TA) is اِسْأَلْ; (S, M, Msb, K, TA;) and
(S, K, &c.) that of سَالَ, (S, Msb, TA,) سَلْ, (S,
Msb, K, TA,) dual. سَلَا, and pl. سَلُوا, [these two
being] irregular; (Msb;) and AAF mentions that
Aboo-'Othmán heard one say اِسَلْ, [a form
omitted in some copies of the K, but mentioned
in the CK,] meaning اِسْأَلْ, suppressing the ء, and
transferring its vowel to the preceding letter, like
as some of the Arabs said لَحْمَرُ for الأَحْمَرُ [as
many do in the present day]: (M:) accord. to
ISd, (TA,) the Arabs universally suppress the ء
in the imperative except when they prefix to it
فَ or وَ; (M, TA;) saying فَاسْأَلْ and وَاسْأَلْ:
(TA:) or when وَ [or فَ] is prefixed, it is allowable to pronounce the ء and also to suppress it, as
in saying وَاسْأَلُوا and وَسَلُوا: (Msb:) and for the
pass. سُئِلَ, one may say سِيلَ, and سُيِلَ, in this
instance making the kesreh to partake of the
sound of dammeh, and سُولَ; and also سُيِلَ, in
which the middle letter is pronounced with a
sound between that of ء and that of ى, or resembling that of و. (IJ, TA.) As Er-Rághib
says, سُؤَالٌ signifies The asking, or demanding,
knowledge, or information, or what leads thereto:
and the asking, or demanding, property, or what
leads thereto. (TA.) سَأَلْتُهُ عَنِ الشَّىْءِ means I
asked of him information respecting the thing:
(IB, TA: [and the like is said in the Msb:])
and سَأَلْتُهُ الشَّىْءَ [is sometimes used in the same
sense, as has been shown above, but generally]
means I asked him to give me the thing: (IB,
TA:) you say, سَأَلَهُ مَالًا He asked, demanded, or
begged, of him property, and in like manner,
سَأَلَ مِنْهُ and سَأَلَ إِلَيْهِ [followed by مَالًا]: (MA:)
and سَأَلْتُ اللّٰهَ العَافِيَةَ, inf. n. سُؤَالٌ and مَسْأَلَةٌ, I
begged, or sought, of God health, or freedom
from disease, &c. (Msb.) The saying in the
Kur [lxx. 1], سَأَلَ سَائِلٌ بِعَذَابٍ وَاقِعٍ means عَنْ
عَذَابٍ [i. e. An asker asked respecting a falling
punishment]: (S:) [for] one says, خَرَجْنَا نَسْأَلُ
عَنْ فُلَانٍ and بِفُلَانٍ [meaning We went forth
asking respecting such a one]: (Akh, S:) or the
phrase in the Kur means a caller called [for a
falling punishment]: (TA:) and some read
سَالَ سَائِلٌ بعذاب واقع, (Bd, TA,) [likewise] from
السُّؤَالُ: (Bd:) or this means سَالَ وَادٍ بعذاب واقع
[i. e. a valley flowed with a falling punishment];
(Bd, TA;) so some say; (TA;) from السَّيَلَانُ.
(Bd.) The saying, in a trad., نَهَى عَنْ كَثْرَةِ السَّؤَالِ
[He (Mohammad) forbade much questioning or
inquiring] is said to relate to subtile questions or
inquiries, that are needless; like another trad.,
mentioned below, voce, مَسْأَلَةٌ: or to the begging,
of men, their property needlessly. (TA.)
3
سَآءَلَهُ, (M, TA,) inf. n. مُسَآءَلَةٌ: (TA:) see 1,
first sentence. Aboo-Dhu-eyb says,
أَسَآءَلْتَ رَسْمَ الدَّارِ أَمْ لَمْ تُسَائِلِ
عَنِ السَّكْنِ أَمْ عَنْ عَهْدِهِ بِالأَوَائِلِ
[Didst thou ask the remains of the dwelling, or
didst thou not ask, respecting the inhabitants,
or respecting their knowledge of the former occupants?]. (M, TA.) ―
-b2-  In the saying of Bilál
Ibn-Jereer,
وَجَدْتَ بِهِمْ عِلَّةً حَاضِرَهْ  إِذَا ضِفْتَهُمْ أَوْ سَآيَلْتَهُمْ
[When thou becomest their guest, or askest of
them, thou findest with them a ready excuse],
سَآيَلْتَهُمْ is a combination of two dial. vars.; the ء
being in the original phrase سَآءَلْتُ زَيْدًا, and the
ى being a substitute in the phrase سَايَلْتُ زَيْدًا;
the measure of سَآيَلْتَهُمْ being فَعَايَلْتَهُمْ: (M, K: *)
so said Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà, [i. e. Th,] who had
at first ignored the expression: (M:) and it is an
instance of which we know not a parallel in the
language. (M, K. *) ―
-b3-  [Accord. to analogy,
سَآءَلَهَ also signifies He asked him, &c., being
asked by him, &c. ―
-b4-  And Freytag states that
Reiske has explained سَآءَلَ as meaning He always
demanded that another should express wishes for
his health: but I know not any instance of its
being used in this sense.]
4
أَسْاَ^َ ↓ أَسْأَلَهُ سُؤْلَهُ, (K,) or ↓ سُؤْلَتَهُ, (S,) and ↓ مَسْأَلَتَهُ,
(S, K,) He accomplished for him his want.
(S, K.)
5
تسأّل, in the modern language, signifies
He begged, or asked alms; as also تَسَوَّلَ: both
probably post-classical.]
6
تَسَآءَلُوا They asked, or begged, one another.
(S, Msb, K.) You say, هُمَا يَتَسَآءَلَانِ, (M,) and
also يَتَسَاوَلَانِ, (M, Msb, K,) and يَتَسَايَلَانِ.
(TA.) In the Kur [iv. 1], some read وَاتَّقُوا اللّٰهَ
الَّذِى تَسَّآءَلُونَ بِهِ; and others, تَسَآءَلُونَ بِهِ: in each
case, originally تَتَسَآءَلُونَ: the meaning is, [And
fear ye God,] by Whom ye demand [one of
another] your rights, or dues: (M:) or by Whom
ye ask, or demand, one of another; (Bd, Jel;)
saying, I ask thee, or beg thee, by God; and I
beseech thee, or adjure thee, by God. (Jel.) ―
-b2-
One says also تَسَآءَلُوا القَوْمَ, meaning They [together] asked, or begged, the people. (Mgh in
art. نقض.)
سُؤْلٌ, (S, M, K;) also pronounced سُولٌ, without
ء, (S, K,) [A petition; or a request; meaning]
a thing that people ask or beg; (S;) or a thing
that one has asked or begged; (M, K;) as also
↓ سُؤْلَةٌ, (IJ, M, K,) which is likewise pronounced
سُولَةٌ, without ء; (K;) and ↓ سُؤُولٌ; (Har p. 422;
[or this is app. pl. of سُؤْلٌ, like as بُرُوجٌ is of بُرْجٌ,
and بُرُودٌ of بُرْدٌ, &c.;]) [and ↓ سَأْلَةٌ or سَأَلَةٌ, as
will be shown by what follows;] and ↓ مَسْؤُولٌ;
(Msb;) [and ↓ مَسْأَلَةٌ:] see 4: the first of these
said by Z to be of the measure فُعْلٌ in the sense
of the measure مَفْعُولٌ; like عُرْفٌ and نُكْرٌ. (TA.)
Thus in the Kur [xx. 36], قَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يَا مُوسَى
Thou hast been granted thy petition, or the thing
that thou hast asked, O Moses. (S, M, TA.) In
the saying ↓ اَللّٰهُمَّ أَعْطِنَا سَأَلَاتِنَا [O God, grant
Thou us our petitions], mentioned by Aboo-
'Alee on the authority of AZ, the inf. n. is used
as a subst., properly so termed, and is therefore
pluralized. (M.)
سَأْلَةٌ or سَأَلَةٌ; pl. سَأَلَاتٌ: see the next preceding
paragraph, in two places.
سُؤْلَةٌ: see 4: and see also سْؤْلٌ.
سُؤَلَةٌ, (S, K,) also pronounced سُوَلَةٌ, (TA,) A
man (S) who asks, or begs, much; (S, K;) as also
↓ سَأّلٌ, and ↓ سَؤُولٌ: (TA:) such is improperly
termed ↓ سَائِلٌ. (Durrat el-Ghowwás, in De
Sacy's Anthol. Gramm. Ar., p. 47 of the Ar.
text.)
سُؤَالٌ an inf. n. of 1. (S, M, K, &c.) ―
-b2-  [It is
often used as a subst. properly so called; like
مَسْأَلَةٌ; meaning A question; an interrogation;
correlative of جَوَابٌ: and a demand, or petition:
and as such has a pl., سُؤَالَاتٌ; perhaps postclassical.]
سَؤُولٌ: see سُؤَلَةٌ.
سُؤُولٌ: see سُؤْلٌ [of which it is app. pl.].
سَأّلٌ: see سُؤَلَةٌ.
سَائِلٌ [i. e. Asking; meaning interrogating,
questioning, or inquiring; and demanding, or
begging;] has for its pl. سَأَلَةٌ and سُؤَّالٌ. (TA.)
See سُؤَلَةٌ. ―
-b2-  It also means [A beggar; i. e.] a
poor man asking, or begging, a thing. (Er-Rághib, TA.) So it has been expl. as used in
the Kur [xciii. 10], where it is said, وَأَمَّا السَّائِلَ
فَلَا تَنْهَرْ [And as for the beggar, thou shalt not
chide him, or address him with rough speech]:
or, accord. to El-Hasan, it here means the seeker
of knowledge. (TA.)
مَسْأَلَةٌ, an inf. n. of 1, is tropically used in the
sense of a pass. part. n. [with the noun qualified
by it understood; meaning (tropical:)  A thing asked; i. e.
a question; a problem, or proposition; a matter,
or an affair, proposed for decision or determination]: (TA:) and the pl. is مَسَائِلُ. (Msb, TA.)
So in the saying, تَعَلَّمْتُ مَسْأَلَةً (tropical:)  [I learned a
question, or problem, &c.]. (TA.) The saying,
in a trad., كَرِهَ المَسَائِلَ وَعَابَهَا means (assumed tropical:)  [He
(Mohammad) disliked and discommended] subtile
questions, such as are needless. (TA.) ―
-b2-  See
also سُؤْلٌ: ―
-b3-  and see 4.
مَسْؤُولٌ [pass. part. n. of 1: and used as a
subst.]: see سُؤْلٌ.
