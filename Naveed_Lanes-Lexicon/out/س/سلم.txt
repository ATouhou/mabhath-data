سلم1
سَلِمَ, [aor.
سَلَمَ,] inf. n. سَلَامَةٌ (S, M, A, Mgh,
Msb, K) and سَلَامٌ (A, TA) and سَلَمٌ and سَلْمٌ
and سِلْمٌ, (Bd in xxxix. 30,) He was, or became,
safe, or secure; or he escaped; (M, TA;) or he was,
or became, free; (TA;) مِنَ الآفَاتِ [from evils of
any kind], (S, Mgh,) or مِنَ الآفَةِ [from evil of any
kind], (K,) or مِنَ البَلَآءِ [from trial, or affliction],
(A, TA,) or مِنَ الأَمْرِ [from the affair]: (M:) he
(a traveller) was, or became, safe, secure, or free,
from evils of any kind: (Msb:) and سَلِمَ مِنَ العَيْبِ
he was, or became, free from fault, defect, imperfection, blemish, or vice; syn. بَرِئَ. (Msb in
art. برأ.) [Hence,] one says, لَا بِذِى تَسْلَمُ مَا كَانَ
گَذَا وَكَذَا, (ISk, S, K, *) meaning No, by God [or
Him] who maketh thee to be in safety, (ISk, S,
K,) [such and such things were not;] and to two
persons لا بذى تَسْلَمَانِ, and to a pl. number
لا بذى تَسْلَمُونَ, and to a female لا بذى تَسْلَمِينَ,
and to a pl. number [of females] لا بذى تَسْلَمْنَ.
(ISk, S, K. *) And لَا أَفْعَلُ ذٰلِكَ بِذِى تَسْلَمُ, meaning, بِذِى سَلَامَتِكِ [i. e. I will not do that, by the
Author (lit. Lord or Master) of thy safety]; and
in like manner, بذى تَسْلَمَانِ, and بذى تَسْلَمُونَ.
(Sb, M. [See also ذو.]) And اِذْهَبْ بِذِى تَسْلَمُ,
i. e. اِذْهَبْ بِسَلَامَتِكَ [Go thou with thy safety;
or, with the Author of thy safety to protect thee;
meaning go thou in safety]; and [to two persons]
اِذْهَبَا بِذِى تَسْلَمَانِ. (S, K.) ذى is thus prefixed
to a verb [as virtually governing it in the gen.
case] like as آيَة is in an instance mentioned
under this latter word; but these are two extr.
instances; for only a noun significant of time is
[regularly] prefixed to a verb, as in the phrase
هٰذَا يَوْمُ يُفْعَلُ, meaning يُفْعَلُ فِيهِ: (Akh, S:) it
is not prefixed to any but this verb تَسْلَمُ [and its
variations as above mentioned]. (Sb, M, K.) ―
-b2-
And hence, (Mgh,) one says also, سَلِمَتْ لَهُ الضَّيْعَةُ,
meaning [The landed estate] was, or became, free
from participation to him; syn. خَلَصَت. (Mgh,
TA.)
-A2-  سلمهُ, [app. سَلَمَهُ, or perhaps سَلِمَهُ, for
some verbs of this measure are trans., as حَسِبَ and
وَرِثَ,] inf. n. سلم, [app. سَلَمٌ, q. v. infrà,] He
made him a captive. (TA.)
-A3-  سَلَمَتْهُ الحَيَّةُ,
(TA,) inf. n. سَلْمٌ, (M, K, TA,) The serpent bit
him: (M, * K, * TA:) mentioned by Az, but he
adds that no one but Lth has said this. (TA.)
-A4-
سَلَمَ الجِلْدَ, aor.
سَلِمَ, (S, K,) inf. n. سَلْمٌ, (TA,)
He tanned the skin with [قَرَظ, i. e. leaves of] the
سَلَم [or mimosa flava]. (S, K, TA.) ―
-b2-  سَلَمَ
الدَّلْوَ, (M, K,) aor.
سَلِمَ, inf. n. سَلْمٌ, (M,) He
finished making the leathern bucket; and made
it firm, strong, or sound, or made it firmly,
strongly, or soundly. (M, K.)
2
سلّمهُ, (S, M, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَسْلِيمٌ, (K,)
He (God) made him to be safe, secure, or free;
saved, secured, or freed, him; (M, Msb, TA;)
مِنَ الآفَاتِ [from evils of any kind], (S, Msb,)
or مِنَ الآفَةِ [from evil of any kind], (K,) or
مِنَ الأَمْرِ [from the affair]. (M.) [Freytag
assigns the same meaning to ↓ اسلمهُ also, as on
the authority of the Ham; in which I find no
explanation of this verb except one which will be
found later in this paragraph.] ―
-b2-  [Hence,]
التَّسْلِيمُ is also syn. with السَّلَامُ, (S, K, TA,) as
meaning The saluting, or greeting, one with a
prayer for his safety, or security, or freedom,
from evils of any kind in his religion and in his
person; and the interpretation thereof is [the
expressing a desire for] التَّخْلِيصٌ; (Mbr, TA;)
or the saluting, or greeting, one with a prayer
for his life; or, by saying سَلَامٌ عَلَيْكَ [q. v.
infrà, voce سَلَامٌ]; syn. التَّحِيَّةُ. (TA.) You say,
سَلَّمَ عَلَيْهِ [meaning He so saluted, or greeted,
him]. (M, Msb.) [This, when said of God, virtually means سَلَّمَهُ, i. e. He saved him; and
should be rendered agreeably with this explanation in the phrase commonly used after the mention of the Prophet, صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ May
God bless and save him. You say also, سَلَّمَ عَلَيْهِ
بِالخِلَافَةِ He saluted him with the acknowledgment of his being Khaleefeh; saying, سَلَامٌ عَلَيْكَ
يَا أَمِيرَ المُؤْمِنِينَ Salutation to thee, or peace be
on thee, &c., O Prince of the Faithful.] التَّسْلِيمَةُ
signifies The salutation that is pronounced on
finishing every two rek'ahs in prayer: (Har
p. 180:) [and also that which is pronounced after
the last rek'ah of each of the prayers (i. e. after
the sunneh prayers and the fard alike), addressed
to the two guardian and recording angels: (see
my “ Modern Egyptians,” ch. iii., p. 78 of the
5th ed.:) and سَلَّمَ means He pronounced either
of those salutations.] ―
-b3-  [Hence also,] سلّم إِلَيْهِ
الشَّىْءَ, (S, K, *) inf. n. as above; (K;) and ↓ اسلم
اليه الشىءَ; (M;) He gave to him the thing;
(S, * M, K;) or delivered it to him: (M:) [he
resigned it to him:] and سلّم إِلَيْهِ الوَدِيعَةَ, (Mgh,)
or سلّم الوَدِيعَةَ لِصَاحِبِهَا, He delivered the deposit
[to him, or] to its owner: (Msb:) and ↓ اسلم
الثَّوْبَ إِلَى الخَيَّاطِ (Mgh) signifies the same as
سلّمهُ إِلَيْهِ [i. e. He delivered the garment, or
piece of cloth, to the tailor]. (Har p. 166.) ―
-b4-
See also 4, in two places. ―
-b5-  You say also, سلّم
الأَجِيرُ نَفْسَهُ لِلْمُسْتَأْجِرِ The hired man gave himself
up, or gave authority over himself, to the hirer.
(Msb.) And ↓ أَسْلَمْتُهُ and سَلَّمْتُهُ I left him in
the power of him who desired to kill him or to
wound him. (Ham p. 115.) And لِلْهَلَكَةِ ↓ اسلمهُ
[He gave him up to destruction]: in this case
with [the prep.] ل only. (Har p. 166.) And
الرَّجُلَ ↓ اسلم, (S, * M, Msb, *) or العَدُوَّ, (K,) He
left, forsook, or deserted, (M, K,) the man, (S, *
M, Msb, *) or the enemy; (K;) or abstained from
aiding, or assisting, him; (S, M, Msb, K;) and
threw him into destruction. (IAth, TA.) And
لِمَا بِهِ ↓ اسلمهُ He left him [to that bane which
was in him: app. referring to the bite of a serpent, or any evil affection: see سَلِيمٌ, third sentence]. (S, * M.) ―
-b6-  And سلّم أَمْرَهُ إِلَى اللّٰهِ and
↓ اسلمهُ, both meaning the same, (S, Msb, K,
TA,) i. e. He committed his case to God. (TA.)
―
-b7-  And سلّم الدَّعْوَى He acknowledged the truth
[or justice] of the claim, demand, or suit; [he
conceded its truth or justice;] from سلّم الوَدِيعَةَ
لِصَاحِبِهَا, expl. above; denoting an ideal delivering
[or yielding of a thing to another person]. (Msb.)
[Hence one says, سلّم أَنَّهُ كَذَا He conceded that
it was thus.] ―
-b8-  And التَّسْلِيمُ signifies also [The
assenting, or] the giving [one's] approval (S, K,
TA) unreservedly, (S,) to that which is ordained,
or decreed, (S, K, TA,) by God; and the submitting to his commands; and the abstaining from
offering opposition in the case in which it is not
becoming [to do so]. (TA.) You say, سلّم لِأَمْرِ
اللّٰهِ He assented to the command of God: [or he
gave his approval to it:] or he submitted to it;
as also ↓ اسلم. (MA.)
3
سالمهُ, (M, Msb,) inf. n. مُسَالَمَةٌ (S, M, Msb)
and سِلَامٌ, (M, Msb,) He made peace, or became
at peace or reconciled, with him; or he reconciled
himself with him: [implying mutual concession,
or a compromise:] (S, * M, Msb:) and سَالَمَا
They made peace, or became at peace or reconciled, or they reconciled themselves, each with the
other. (K.)
4
أَسْلَمَ see 2, in nine places. [The first of the
meanings there assigned to this verb is, in my
opinion, more than doubtful. In all its senses, it
seems to be properly trans.: when it is used as
an intrans. verb, an objective complement is app.
understood. Thus,] أَسْلَمَ is syn. with أَسْلَفَ [as
meaning He paid in advance, or beforehand];
(S, M, Mgh, Msb;) الثَّمَنَ [the price] being suppressed, though sometimes it is expressed; (Mgh;)
as also ↓ سلّم; (M;) and ↓ تسلّم, as occurring in
a trad., where it is said, مَنْ تَسَلَّمَ فِى شَىْءٍ فَلَا
يَصْرِفُهُ إِلَى غَيْرِهِ [Whoso pays in advance for a
thing, he shall not turn it over, or transfer it, to
another than him]; but Kt says that he had not
heard this verb thus used except in this instance.
(TA.) So the first of these verbs signifies in the
saying, اسلم فِى الطَّعَامِ (S) or فى البُرِّ (Mgh)
[He paid in advance for the wheat], and فى
الشَّىْءِ [for the thing], as also ↓ سلّم. (M.) And
hence the saying, إِذَا أَسْلَمَ صُوفًا فِى لِبْدٍ أَوْ شَعَرًا فِى
مِسْحٍ لَمْ يَجُزْ [If he give in advance wool for felt,
or goats' hair for a garment, or piece, of haircloth, it will not be allowable]. (Mgh.) And so
in the phrase, أَسْلَمْتُ إِلَيْهِ [I paid in advance to
him]. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  Also [He resigned, or submitted, himself; نَفْسَهُ being understood: or] he
was, or became, resigned, or submissive; (M, K;)
and so ↓ استسلم: (S, M, Msb, K:) you say, اسلم
لِلّٰهِ [He resigned, or submitted, himself, or he was,
or became, resigned, or submissive, to God: see
also an ex. (before referred to) in the last sentence of the second paragraph: or he was, or
became, sincere in his religion, or without hypocrisy, towards God: see مُسْلِمٌ]: (Msb:) [or]
اسلم signifies he entered into السِّلْم, (S, Msb,)
which here means الاِسْتِسْلَام [i. e. the state of
resignation, or submission]. (S.) ―
-b3-  And He
became a Muslim; as also ↓ تسلّم; (M, * K;) as
in the saying, كَانَ كَافِرًا ثُمَّ تَسَلَّمَ, i. e. أَسْلَمَ [He
was an unbeliever, or a denier of the unity of
God, &c.; then he became a Muslim]: (M:) or
he entered [the pale, or communion, of] the religion of الإِسْلَام. (S, * Msb.) الإِسْلَامُ as a principle of the law of God is The manifesting of
humility or submission, and outward conforming
with the law of God, and the taking upon oneself
to do or to say as the Prophet has done or said:
for this, the blood is to be spared, and one may
demand the repelling of evil: (T, * M:) and if
there is therewith firm belief with the heart, it is
إِيمَانٌ: (T:) this is the doctrine of Esh-Sháfi'ee;
but the doctrine of Aboo-Haneefeh makes no
difference between these two terms: (KT:)
[agreeably with the former doctrine,] Th well
and briefly says, الاسلام is with the tongue, and
الايمان is with the heart: and he says, in explaining verse 48 of ch. v. of the Kur, that every
prophet has been sent with الاسلام, though the
ordinances differ. (M.) ―
-b4-  One says also, أَسْلَمْتُ
عَنْهُ, meaning I left it [app. an affair, as in an
explanation in the TK,] after I had been [engaged] in it. (Ibn-Buzurj, K.) And اسلم occurs
intransitively in the saying, كَانَ رَاعِىَ غَنَمٍ ثُمَّ
أَسْلَمَ, meaning [He was a pastor of sheep, or
goats; then] he left them. (M.) ―
-b5-  [Freytag
assigns to اسلم another signification “ Adscendere
fecit (vid. a سُلَّم),” as from the Ham, p. 39: but
this is app. a mistake, into which he has been led
by a saying, there cited, of Zuheyr, which I read
thus:
هَوِىَّ الدَّلْوِ أَسْلَمَهَا الرِّشَآءُ
(meaning, The descent, or as the descent, of the
bucket that the well-rope has let go): and by its
being there said that “ you should not prefer any
reading of هوى to that with damm, though it
has been said otherwise: ” whereas the correct
reading is, in my opinion, هَوِىّ, agreeably with
what here follows:] Er-Riyáshee says, on the
authority of AZ, that الهَوِىُّ, with fet-h, is downwards; and with damm, upwards; and he cites
the saying above as an ex. of the word as meaning downwards. (TA in art. هوى.)
5
تسلّم مِنْهُ He asserted, or declared, himself
to be free from, or clear of, or quit of, it, or
him. (M.) ―
-b2-  تسلّم is also syn. with أُسْلَمَ, in two
senses: see the latter, in two places.
-A2-  And
تسلّمهُ signifies He took it, or received it; namely,
a thing given, or delivered. (S, M, Msb, K.)
6
تسالموا, (M,) and تسالما, (K,) inf. n. تَسَالُمٌ,
(S,) They, (M,) or they two, (K,) made peace,
or became at peace or reconciled, (S, * M, K,)
one with another, (S, M,) or each with the other.
(S, K.) [See also 8.] ―
-b2-  One says of a man,
(M,) of a great, or frequent, liar, (TA,) لَا تَسَالَمُ
خَيْلَاهُ, [for تَتَسَالَمُ,] (M,) or لَا يَتَسَالَمُ خَيْلَاهُ, (K,
TA,) [(assumed tropical:)  His two troops of horses will not agree
in pace, each with the other;] meaning (tropical:)  [his
assertions will not be found to agree together; or]
he will not say what is true, so that it may be
accepted from him: for تَسَالَمَتْ, said of horses,
means (assumed tropical:)  they kept pace, one with another;
(تَسَايَرَتْ [q. v.];) not exciting one another. (M,
K, TA.)
8
استلم He became at peace, or reconciled.
(TA.) Hence the saying, (TA,) هُوَ لَا يَسْتَلَمُ عَلَى
سَخَطِهِ He will not become at peace, or reconciled,
during his displeasure at a thing. (K, TA.) [See
also 6.] ―
-b2-  استلم الزَّرْعُ The seed-produce put
forth its ears. (K.)
-A2-  استلم الحَجَرَ He touched,
(S, K,) or reached, (Mgh,) the stone, [meaning
the Black Stone of the Kaabeh,] by kissing, or
with the hand: (S, Mgh, K:) or he wiped it, or
stroked it, with the hand: (Mgh:) or he kissed
the stone: or he embraced it: (M:) and اِسْتَلْأَمَهُ
signifies the same; (M, K;) but is not the original:
(M:) accord. to ISk, the Arabs pronounced it
with hemz, contr. to analogy; (Msb;) or it
should not be pronounced with hemz, though
some thus pronounce it, (S,) the original being
استلم, (ISk, Msb,) because it is from سِلَامٌ [pl.
of سَلِمَةٌ] signifying “ stones,” (ISk, S, * M, Msb, *
[in the Mgh, from سَلِمَةٌ signifying “ a stone,”
and in the Msb the pl. of سَلِمَةٌ is said to be سَلَامٌ,
like كَلَامٌ,]) accord. to Sb, who says that it does
not denote the act of taking; (M;) or, accord. to
Sb, it is from السَّلَامُ, with fet-h, meaning “ salutation,” and it means the touching with the
hand by way of salutation in order to obtain a
blessing thereby: (TA:) but accord. to IAar, the
original is with hemz, from المُلَآءَمَةُ, meaning
الاِجْتِمَاعُ [“ the coming together,” &c., because
denoting contact]. (Msb.) Abu-t-Tufeyl is related to have said, رَأَيْتُ رَسُولَ اللّٰهِ صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ
وَسَلَّمَ يَطُوفُ عَلَى رَاحِلَتِهِ يَسْتَلِمُ بِمِحْجَنِهِ وَيُقَبِّلُ
المِحْجَنَ [i. e. I saw the Apostle of God (may
God bless and save him) circuiting around the
Kaabeh, upon his camel, touching the Black Stone
with his hooked staff, and kissing the hooked staff].
(TA.) The primary signification of الاِسْتِلَامُ is
[said to be] The wiping, or stroking, the سَلِمَة,
i. e. the stone: afterwards it was used in relation
to other things, and one said اِسْتَلَمْتُ يَدَهَا, meaning I stroked, or kissed, her hand. (Har pp. 30
and 31.) ―
-b2-  استلم الخُفُّ قَدَمَيْهِ means The boot
rendered his feet soft [after he had been accustomed to walking barefoot]. (TA.)
10
إِسْتَسْلَمَ see 4, in the former half of the paragraph.
-A2-  استسلم ثَكَمَ الطَّرِيقِ He went upon the middle
of the road, not missing it. (K, * TA. [In the
CK, after واسْتَسْلَمَ انقادَ, for وثَكَمَ الطَّرِيقِ, meaning
واستسلم ثَكَمَ الطَّرِيقِ, is erroneously put وتَسَلَّمَ
الطَّرِيقَ, assigning to تسلّم a meaning belonging
to استسلم.])
Q. Q. 2
تَمَسْلَمَ [from مُسْلِمٌ] He named, or
called, himself a Muslim; or he named himself
Muslim; his name having before been Mohammad: (M, K:) mentioned by Er-Ru-ásee. (M.)
سَلْمٌ: see the next paragraph, in six places.
-A2-
Also A leathern bucket (دَلْوٌ) having one عُرْوَة [or
loop-shaped handle], (T, S, M, K,) with which
the waterer walks, like the buckets (دِلَآء) of the
attendants of the camels or other beasts upon
which water is drawn or which carry water, (T,
TA,) or like the دَلْو of the water-carriers: (S,
K:) expl. in the S as above as on the authority of
AA; but IB says that the correct explanation is,
having one عَرْقُوَة [or stick fixed across from one
part of the brim to the to the opposite part, serving as
a handle as well as to keep it from collapsing]:
(TA:) of the masc. gender [whereas دَلْوٌ is fem.]:
(M:) pl. [of pauc.] أَسْلُمٌ and [of mult.] سِلَامٌ,
(M, K,) and Lh mentions as its pl. أَسَالِمُ, which
is extr. [unless as a pl. pl., i. e. pl. of أَسْلُمٌ]. (M.)
سِلْمٌ Peace, or reconciliation; as also ↓ سَلْمٌ;
(S, M, Msb, K;) masc. and fem.; (S, Msb, K; *)
and ↓ سَلَمٌ and ↓ سَلَامٌ are like سِلْمٌ [in signification]: (M: [the context there shows that the
signification mentioned above is what is meant in
this instance:]) or سِلْمٌ signifies the making peace,
or becoming at peace or reconciled, with another
or others; (Ham p. 80;) as also ↓ سَلْمٌ; and both
are sometimes fem. as being syn. with مُصَالَحَةٌ.
(L voce جَنَحَ, q. v.) In the saying of El-Aashà,
أَذَاقَتْهُمُ الحَرْبُ أَنْفَاسَهَا
↓ وَقَدْ تُكْرَهُ الحَرْبُ بَعْدَ السِّلِمْ
[War made them, or has made them, to taste its
draughts, and verily war is disliked after peace],
he has transferred the vowel of the م to the ل, in
pausing; or it may be that he has inserted a
kesreh in imitation of the preceding kesreh: it is
not an instance like إِبِل, in the opinion of Sb;
for in his opinion the latter is the only instance of
its kind. (M.) It is said in a trad., respecting
El-Hodeybiyeh, أَخَذَ ثَمَانِينَ مِنْ أَهْلِ مَكَّةَ سِلْمًا,
or ↓ سَلْمًا, or ↓ سَلَمًا, accord. to different relations,
meaning [He took forty of the people of Mekkeh]
peaceably: thus expl. by El-Homeydee, in his
“ Ghareeb. ” (TA. [See also سَلَمٌ below.]) ―
-b2-
Also i. q. ↓ سَلَامٌ, (S, K, TA,) as signifying Selfresignation, or submission; (TA; [and thus the
latter is expl. in one place in the S;]) which is
also a signification of ↓ سَلَمٌ: (S, M, K, TA:) and
this is meant in the Kur [iv. 96], where it is said,
لَسْتَ مُؤْمِنًا ↓ وَلَا تَقُولُوا لِمَنْ أَلْقَى إِلَيْكُمُ السَّلَامَ, (Bd,
TA,) or ↓ السَّلَمَ, as some read, (Bd,) [i. e. And
say not ye to him who offers to you submission,
Thou art not a believer:] or ↓ السَّلَامَ here means
the salutation of الإِسْلَام [by saying سَلَامٌ عَلَيْكُمْ]:
(Bd, TA: *) or salutation, and submission by
uttering the profession of الإِسْلَام; and so ↓ السَّلَمَ:
(Jel:) [or the latter here means, simply, salutation; and this is app. what is meant by its being
said that] السَّلَمُ is the subst. from التَّسْلِيمُ; (K;)
[but accord. to SM,] this means the unreserved
approval of what is decreed; and this is said to
be meant by the reading السَّلَمَ mentioned above.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  And [hence] السِّلْمُ signifies also الإِسْلَامُ
[as meaning The religion of the Muslims; because it is a religion of self-resignation, or submission]: (S, K:) this is meant in the Kur
[ii. 204], where it is said, اُدْخُلُوا فِى السِّلْمِ كَافَّةً
[Enter ye into the religion of El-Islám wholly];
(S, Bd, Jel;) and so ↓ السَّلْمِ, as some there read;
(Bd, Jel;) or both there mean submission and
obedience to God: (Bd:) [and] ↓ السَّلَمُ [also] has
the former meaning. (M.)
-A2-  Also, (S, M, K,)
and ↓ سَلْمٌ, (M,) A man, (S, K, TA,) [and] a
woman, (M,) who makes peace, or is at peace,
with another; (S, M, K;) and in like manner, a
company of men (قَوْمٌ). (M.) This is said to be
meant in the Kur [xxxix. 30], where it is said,
وَرَجْلًا سِلْمًا لِرَجُلٍ, as some read, i. e. And a man
who is at peace with respect to a man: (TA:) or
سِلْمًا and ↓ سَلْمًا and ↓ سَلَمًا, three different readings, in the place of [the more common reading]
سَالِمًا, are all inf. ns. of سَلِمَ, used as epithets [syn.
with سَالِمًا], or ذَا is suppressed before them.
(Bd.) You say, أَنَا سِلْمٌ لِمَنْ سَالَمَنِى [I am one
who is at peace with respect to him who is at
peace with me]. (S, TA.) And a poet says,
[using this word in two different senses, the latter
of which has been mentioned above,]
لِأَهْلِكِ فَاقْبَلِى سِلْمِى  أَنَائِلُ إِنَّنِى سِلْمٌ
[O Náïleh, (نَائِلُ being for نَائِلَةٌ, a woman's
name, apocopated,) verily I am one who is at
peace with respect to thy family, therefore accept
thou my submission]. (TA. [It seems to be
there indicated by the context that سلمى here
means my peace, or reconciliation; which is less
appropriate than the meaning that I have assigned
to it.])
سَلَمٌ: see سَلَامٌ: and see also سِلْمٌ, in seven
places. ―
-b2-  Also, in buying or selling, (Msb,) the
subst. from أَسْلَمَ فِى الشَّىْءِ and سَلَّمَ signifying
أَسْلَفَ, (M,) i. q. سَلَفٌ; (S, Msb, K;) i. e. Any
money, or property, paid in advance, or beforehand, as the price of a commodity for which
the seller has become responsible and which one
has bought on description: (T and TA in art.
سلف:) or payment for a commodity to be delivered at a certain [future] period with something additional to [the equivalent of] the current
price at the time of such payment; this [transaction] being a cause of profit to him who makes
such payment: (TA in that art.:) or a sort of
sale in which the price is paid in advance, and
the commodity is withheld, on the condition of
description, to a certain [future] period: (S and
O in that art., in explanation of سَلَفٌ:) but it is
said in a trad. that the term سَلَمٌ as meaning سَلَفٌ
was disliked; app. because the former is applied
to obedience, and self-resignation, or submission,
to God. (TA.)
-A2-  And The making [one] captive. (K. [See 1, in the latter part of the paragraph.])
-A3-  And A captive; (K;) because he
submits himself. (TA.) One says, أَخَذَهُ سَلَمًا,
(M, TA, [in the TK بِالسَّلَمِ,]) He took him [a
captive], (TA,) or made him captive, (M,) without war: (M, TA:) or he brought him in a state
of submission, not resisting; and so, if wounded:
(IAar, M, TA:) and thus El-Khattábee has expl.
the phrase in the trad. respecting El-Hodeybiyeh
cited above, voce سِلْمٌ. (TA.)
-A4-  Also A sort of
tree, (S, M, Msb, K,) [the mimosa flava of Forskål,
who writes its Arabic name in Italic characters
syllæm, and in Arabic characters سليم, (Flora
Aegypt. Arab., p. cxxiii.,)] a species (M) of the
[kind of thorny trees called] عِضَاه, (S, M, Mgh,
Msb, TA, [not غَضَاة, as in the Lexicons of Golius
and Freytag,]) the leaves whereof are the قَرَظ,
with which skin is tanned: (TA:) AHn says, its
branches are long, like rods; and it has no wood
such as is used in carpentry, even if it grows
large: it has slender, long thorns, grievous when
they wound the foot of a man; and a yellow
[fruit such as is termed] بَرَمَة [n. un. of بَرَمٌ, see
this word, and see also حُبْلَةٌ,] which is the sweetest of the بَرَم in odour; and they tan with its
leaves: and it is said, on the authority of the
Arabs of the desert, that it has a yellow flower,
containing a green grain (حَبَّة خَضْرَآء [or this
may mean a grain of a dark, or an ashy, dustcolour]), of sweet odour, in which is somewhat of
bitterness, and of which the gazelles are very
fond: (M:) the n. un. is with ة: (S, M, Mgh,
Msb, K:) and pl. أَسْلَامٌ, (M,) and سِلَامٌ is said by
IB to be pl. of the n. un., like as إِكَامٌ is of أَكَمَةٌ.
(TA.) [Hence,] ذَاتُ أَسْلَامٍ A land (أَرْض) that
gives growth to the [trees called] سَلَم. (K.) See
also سلَمَان.
سَلِمٌ Stones; (S, M;) as also ↓ سِلَامٌ: (M:) and
↓ سَلِمَةٌ [as n. un. of the former and sing. of the
latter, (incorrectly written by Freytag, in one
place, سَلَمَةٌ, and incorrectly said by him to be of
the dial. of the people of Himyer,)] signifies a
stone: (S, M, Mgh, Msb:) [or] the pl. [or quasipl. n.] of سَلِمَةٌ in this sense is ↓ سَلَامٌ, like كَلَامٌ
in measure: (Msb:) or ↓ سَلِمَةٌ signifies stones;
(K;) or hard stones; (TA;) and ↓ سِلَامٌ is its pl.:
(K:) [said to be] so called because of their freedom (سلَامَة) from softness: (TA:) or this last
signifies stones, the small thereof and the large;
and they assign to it no sing.: (ISh, TA:) or
سلام [probably meaning ↓ سَلَامٌ] is a quasi-pl. n.:
(Aboo-Kheyreh, TA:) and it is also said to be a
name for any broad stone. (TA.) See also
سَلَمَان. A poet says, (namely, Bujeyr Ibn-
'Anameh, IB, TA,)
يَرْمِى وَرَائِى بِامْسَهْكِ وَامْسَهْمِ وَامْسَلِمَهْ
[He casts from behind me (i. e. defends me) with
the arrow and the stone]: this [usage of ام for ال]
is of the dial. of [Teiyi and] Himyer. (S, TA.)
السِّلِمْ for السِّلْمْ: see سِلْمٌ, second sentence.
سَلِمَةٌ: see سَلِمٌ, in two places: and سَلَمَان.

Also A woman soft, or tender, in the أَطْرَاف [or
fingers, or other extremities]. (K.) ―
-b2-  And An
old and weak she-camel. (IAar, TA in art. سد.)
سَلْمَى A certain plant (K, TA) which becomes
green in the [season called] صَيْف [app. here
meaning spring]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  أَبُو سَلْمَى The [species
of lizard called] وَزَغ: (K:) or, some say, [as
is said in the M,] ↓ أَبُو سَلْمَانَ. (TA.) ―
-b3-  See
also the next paragraph. ―
-b4-  [In the CK, by a
mistranscription, a meaning belonging to سُلَامَى
is assigned to سَلْمَى.]
السَّلْمَآء, accord. to Aboo-Mis-hal, as meaning
The earth, occurs in the prov., أَنْفٌ قِى المَآءِ وَاسْتٌ
فِى السَّلْمَآءِ [A nose in the water and a rump on
the earth]: and if this be correct, it may be
derived from سلام [i. e. سِلَامٌ] meaning “ stones: ”
and it may be originally ↓ السَّلْمَى, and lengthened
for the sake of the rhyme. (Ham p. 214.) [But
the reading commonly known is, أَنْفٌ فِى السَّلْمَآءِ
وَاسْتٌ فِى المَآءِ.]
هُوَ سَلْمَانُ بَيْتِهِ He is the special, or particular,
friend of his [another's] house; one who mixes
with him much: from the saying of the Prophet,
سَلْمَانُ مِنَّا أَهْلِ البَيْتِ [Selmán is of us, the people
of the house]; referring to Selmán El-Fárisee.
(Har p. 472.) ―
-b2-  أَبُو سَلْمَانَ: see سَلْمَى. ―
-b3-  Also
A species of the [black beetles called] جِعْلَان [pl.
of جُعَلٌ, q. v.]: (M:) or i. q. جُعَلٌ, (IAar, K,)
or أَبُو جَعْرَان, with fet-h [app. a mistake for kesr]
to the ج: (Kr, TA:) or the largest of the
جِعْلَان: or a certain insect like the جُعَل, having
a pair of wings: (TA:) or the male of the [black
beetles called] خَنَافِس [pl. of خُنْفَسَآءُ, q. v.].
(IAar, TA in art. فرض.)
سَلَمَان or سَلِمَان, accord. to different readings,
occurs in a trad. of Ibn-'Omar, in which it is
said, كَانَ يُصَلِّى عِنْدَ سَلَمَانٍ فِى طَرِيقِ مَكَّةَ [He
used to pray at certain selem-trees, or certain
stones, in the road of Mekkeh]: each may be a
pl. [or rather a quasi-pl. n.]; the former, of
↓ سَلَمَةٌ, the “ tree so called; ” the latter, of ↓ سَلِمَةٌ,
“ stones ” [or a “ stone: ” but both of these explanations are strange]. (TA.)
سَلَامٌ, (S, K, TA,) in its primary acceptation,
(TA,) is syn. with ↓ سَلَامَةٌ, (S, K, TA,) as is also
↓ سَلَمٌ, (S, [so in one of my copies, but omitted in
the other copy,]) and signifies Safety, security,
immunity, or freedom, from faults, defects, imperfections, blemishes, or vices, (S, * [mentioned
in one only of my two copies, and there as
relating peculiarly to the third word,] K, [in
which it ostensibly relates peculiarly to the first
word, but in the CK, by the omission of a و before
it, it is made to relate only to the second word,]
and TA, [accord. to which it relates to the first
and second words, as it is well known to do,]) and
from evils of any kind: (TA:) or [simply]
safety, security, immunity, or freedom; as also
↓ سَلَامَةٌ: (Sb, M:) IKt says that these two
words may be dial. vars. [syn. each with the
other]; or the former may be pl. of the latter [or
rather a coll. gen. n. of which the latter is the
n. un.]: (M, TA:) and Suh says, in the R, that
most of the lexicologists hold them to have one
[and the same] meaning: but that if they considered the language of the Arabs, and the distinction, or limitation, denoted by the ة, they
would see that between them is a great difference
[inasmuch as the former has a large range of
meaning which the latter has not, as will be seen
from what follows]. (TA.) سَلَامٌ عَلَيْكُمْ is an
announcement of the continuance of سَلَامَة [or
safety, &c.]: (Bd in xiii. 24:) [it may therefore
be rendered Safety, &c., be, or light and abide,
on you; or, generally, peace be, or light and
abide, on you; for] it means nothing disliked, or
evil, shall befall you henceforth: (Bd in xvi. 34:)
and سَلَامٌ عَلَيْكَ [may be rendered in like manner;
for it virtually] means I will not do to thee anything that is disliked, or evil; (Bd and Jel in
xix. 48;) nor say to thee henceforward what
would annoy thee, or be disagreeable, or evil, to
thee. (Bd ibid.) It may also be [rendered May
safety, &c., or peace, be, or light and abide, on
you; as] a prayer for سَلَامَة, to those to whom it
is addressed, from the state in which they are at
the time. (Bd in xxviii. 55.) [It is generally
held that this salutation may not be used by, nor
to, any but a Muslim.] In the beginning of an
epistle, the approved practice is to write سَلَامٌ
عَلَيْكَ, without the article ال; and in repeating
it, at the end, to write it with that article.
(Durrat el-Ghowwás, in De Sacy's Anthol.
Gramm. Arabe, p. 72 of the Arabic text. [In
the latter case, the general practice in the present
day is to write simply وَالسَّلَام, suppressing عَلَيْكَ.])
In saluting the dead, one puts عَلَيْكَ first, saying,
عَلَيْكَ سَلَامُ اللّٰهِ. (Ham p. 367.) You also say,
مَا كَانَ كَذَا وَكَذَا ↓ لَا بِسَلَامَتِكَ [No, by thy
safety, such and such things were not]. (S.)
السُّلَامُ is also a name of God, (S, M, Msb, K,)
[applied to Him in the Kur lix. 23, accord. to
some for ذُو السَّلَامِ, i. e. ذُو السَّلَامَةِ,] because of
his safety, or freedom, from defect, and imperfection, and cessation of existence; (IKt, M, TA;)
or from variations, and as being the everlasting,
who brings the creation to nought and will not
come to nought; or, accord. to Suh in the R, He
is so named [as being the Author of Safety,
Security, &c.; i. e.] because He has rendered all
his creatures safe, or free, from defectiveness, or
unsoundness, and mankind and the jinn, or genii,
from the betiding of injustice, or wrong, to them,
from Him; and the expositors who assert that
He is thus named because of his safety, or
freedom, from imperfections, and evils of any
kind, utter an unseemly saying, making سَلَامٌ to
be syn. with ↓ سَالِمٌ, which latter applies only to
him who is liable to evil of any kind, and who
expects it, and then becomes safe, or free, from it.
(TA.) دَارُ السَّلَامِ is an appellation of Paradise,
(M, K,) [applied thereto in the Kur vi. 127 and
x. 26,] as being the abode of everlasting safety,
or security; (Zj, M, TA;) the abode of safety, or
security, from evils of any kind, from death and
decrepitude and diseases [&c.]: (TA:) or as
being the abode of God. (M, TA.) ―
-b2-  See also
سِلْمٌ, in four places. ―
-b3-  [As is there stated,] it
signifies also Salutation, or greeting; (M, TA;)
particularly the salutation of الإِسْلَام [by saying
سَلَامٌ عَلَيْكَ or سَلَامٌ عَلَيْكُمْ, expl. above]; (Bd in
iv. 96;) a subst. (S, Mgh, Msb, TA) from سَلَّمَ
عَلَيْهِ, (Msb,) [i. e.] from التُّسْلِيمُ, (S, Mgh, TA,)
like كَلَامٌ from التَّكْلِيمُ. (Mgh. [See 2, third
sentence.]) ―
-b4-  In the saying in the Kur [xxv. 64],
وَإِذَا خَاطَبَهُمُ الْجَاهِلُونَ قَالُوا سَلَامًا [And when the
ignorant speak to them, they say, سَلَامًا], this last
word signifies تَسَلُّمًا, (Sb, M,) or تَسَلُّمًا مِنْكُمْ [for
نَتَسَلَّمُ مِنْكُمْ تَسَلُّمًا We declare ourselves to be
clear, or quit, of you], and مُتَارَكَهً لَلُمْ [for
نُتَارِكُكُمْ مُتَارَكَةً we relinquish you], (Bd,) [and
means] there shall be neither good nor evil
between us (Sb, M, Bd) and you: it is not the
سلام that is used in salutation; for the verse was
revealed at Mekkeh, and the Muslims had not
then been commanded to salute the believers in
a plurality of gods: (Sb, M:) [in iv. 88 of the
Kur, which was promulgated afterwards, at ElMedeeneh, is a general command to return a
salutation with a better or with the same; but
the Sunneh prescribes that the salutation of سَلَامٌ
عَلَيْكَ or سَلَامٌ عَلَيْكُمْ when addressed to a Muslim
by one not a Muslim is to be returned only by
saying وَعَلَيْكَ or وَعَلَيْكُمْ:] or the meaning in
xxv. 64 is, they say a right saying, in which they
are secure from harming and sinning. (Bd.)
Sb asserts that Aboo-Rabee'ah used to say, إِذَا لَقِيتَ
فُلَانًا فَقُلْ سَلَامًا, meaning تَسَلُّمًا [for أَتَسَلَّمُ مِنْكَ
تَسَلُّمًا, i. e. When thou meetest such a one, say,
I declare myself to be clear, or quit, of thee]:
and he says that some of them said سَلَامٌ,
meaning The case of me and thee is the [case of]
being clear, or quit, each of the other; and the [case
of] mutual relinquishing. (M.) [It is usual, in the
present day, to say, اِفْعَلْ كَذَا وَالسَّلَام, meaning
Do thou such a thing, and there will be an end
of altercation between us.]
-A2-  See also سَلِيمٌ.
-A3-
Also A kind of trees; (S, M, Msb, K;) they
assert that they are evergreen; nothing eats
them; but the gazelles keep to them, and protect
themselves by their shade, but do not hide among
them; and they are not great trees, nor of the
kind called عِضَاه: (AHn, M:) they are also
called ↓ سِلَامٌ; (K;) or this is pl. of سَلَمَةٌ [n. un.
of سَلَمٌ], which is of another kind; like as إِكَامٌ
is pl. of أَكَمَةٌ: (IB, TA:) n. un. with ة. (S, M.)
السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ was said to an Arab of the desert;
and he replied, الجَثْجَاثُ عَلَيْكَ: and being asked,
“ What is this reply? ” he answered, “They are
two bitter trees: thou hast put upon me one, so
I have put upon thee the other. ” (K.)
-A4-  See
also سَلِمٌ, in two places.
سِلَامٌ: see سَلِمٌ, in two places:
-A2-  and the paragraph here next preceding, last sentence but two.
سَلِيمٌ i. q. ↓ سَالِمٌ, (S, M, K,) which means Safe,
secure, or free, (Msb,) from evils of any kind;
(K, Msb, TA;) applied to a man: (M:) pl.
سُلَمَآءُ; (M, K, TA;) in some copies of the K
سَلْمَى, like جَرْحَى pl. of جَرِيحٌ; (TA;) [but
this is probably its pl. only when it is used in the
sense of جَرِيحٌ or the like, as seems to be the case
from what follows.] Also, (M,) applied to a
heart: (S, M:) بِقَلْبٍ سَلِيمٍ, in the Kur xxvi. 89,
means With a heart free from unbelief: (M,
TA:) or, divested of corruptness, or unsoundness: (Er-Rághib, TA:) in the Kur xxxvii. 82,
some say that it means with a grieving, or sorrowful, heart; from سَلِيمٌ in the sense here next following. (Bd.) ―
-b2-  Also i. q. لَدِيغٌ [meaning Bitten
by a serpent]; (S, M, K;) as also ↓ سَلَامٌ (S, K)
and ↓ مَسْلُومٌ: (K:) app., (S,) as implying a good
omen, of safety; (S, M;) or because the person
is left (مُسْلَمٌ) to that [bane] which is in him:
(IAar, S, * M:) and sometimes it is metaphorically used as meaning (tropical:)  wounded: (M:) or it
means wounded, at the point of death, (M, K,)
as some say: (M:) pl. سَلْمَى. (M, and Ham
p. 214.)
-A2-  Also, (M, K,) of a horse, (M,) The
part, of the hoof, that is between the أَشْعَر [or
hair, or extremity of the skin, next the hoof],
(M, TA,) or that is between the أَمْعَر [q. v.], (K,)
but the former is the right, (TA,) and the interior
of the hoof. (M, K, TA.)
سَلَامَةٌ [the most usual inf. n. of سَلِمَ]: see سَلَامٌ,
in three places.
-A2-  Also n. un. of سَلَامٌ applied to
a kind of trees [described above]. (S, K.)
سُلَامَى, a noun of the fem. gender, (Msb,) A
certain bone that is in the فِرْسِن [q. v., here
meaning foot] of the camel: (S, K:) this is said
by A'Obeyd to be the primary signification: (S:)
or the سُلَامَى of the camel are the bones of the
فُرْسِن [or foot]: (M:) [for] سُلَامَى is used alike
as sing. and pl., and sometimes it has also a pl.,
(S,) which is سُلَامَيَاتٌ: (S, M, K:) or it is a pl.
[or rather a coll. gen. n.], of which the sing. [or
n. un.] is سُلَامَيَةٌ, signifying the أَنْمَلَة [q. v.] of
[any of] the fingers: (IAth, TA:) [but this is a
strange explanation:] it is said that the last parts
in which مُخّ [here meaning marrow or pulp and
the like] remains in a camel when he has become
emaciated are the سُلَامَى and eye; and when
it has gone from these, he has none remaining:
(S:) the pl. سُلَامَيَاتٌ, (S, TA,) or سُلَامَى, (M,
Msb,) also signifies the bones of the أَصَابِع, (S,
M,) so says Kh, and Zj adds that they are also
called the قَصَب, (Msb,) of the hand and of the
foot; (M;) [i. e., of the fingers and of the toes;
and this seems to be the most common meaning,
in relation to a human being; namely, the phalanges of the fingers and of the toes;] that are
between every two joints [and what are beyond
the extreme joints] of the أَصَابِع: accord. to Lth,
the سلامى are the bones of the أَصَابِع [or fingers
and toes] and the أَشَاجِع and the أَكَارِع, and are
hard and compact bones like كِعَاب [pl. of كَعْبٌ]:
(TA: [see the words that I have here left untranslated, for the senses in which they are here used are
doubtful:]) accord. to IAar, (M,) certain small
bones, of the length of the إِصْبَع [or finger], (M,
K,) or nearly so, (M,) or less, (K,) of which
there are four, or three, (M,) [or app., five, for
the meaning here seems to be the metacarpal and
metatarsal bones, to which the terms سُلَامَى and
سُلَامَيَاتٌ are sometimes applied, (see أَشْجَعُ and
مُشْظٌ,)] in the hand and in the foot, (K,) [i. e.]
in each hand and foot: (M:) Ktr says that the
سلاميات are the عُرُوق [app. a mistake for عِظَام
i. e. bones] of the outer side of the hand and
foot: (Msb:) سلامى is also said to signify any
small hollow bone: and any bone of a human
being: and ISh says that in every horse are six
سلاميات [app. in the fore legs and the same in
the hind legs; for he seems to mean that the
term سلامى is applied to each of the pasternbones and to the coffin-bone; these three corresponding to the phalanges of a human being:
see فَصٌّ]: (TA:) it is not allowable to write
سلامى otherwise than with what is termed the
short alif. (MF, TA.)
-A2-  سُلَامَى, (M, K,) like
سُكَّارَى, (K, TA, [in the CK like سَكْرٰى, which is
shown to be wrong by a verse cited in the M and
TA,]) signifies also The [south, or southerly,
wind called] جَنُوب. (M, K.)
سَلَامَانٌ A kind of tree, (S, M, K,) growing in
soft, or plain, tracts: (M:) AZ says, it is like the
أَلَآء, which is a tree resembling the myrtle, which
changes not in the midst of summer, and which
has a produce resembling the head [or ear] of
millet (ذُرَة), except that it is smaller than the الآء;
tooth-sticks (مَسَاوِيك) are made from it; and its
produce is like that of the الآء; and it grows in
the sands and the deserts: (TA in art. الأ:) n. un.
with ة. (M.)
نَمْلُ سُلَيْمَانُ Red ants [lit. the ants of Solomon].
(TA voce أَحْوَى, in art. حو.)
سُلَّمٌ A ladder, or a series of stairs or steps,
syn. مِرْقَاةٌ, (M, K,) and دَرَجَةٌ, (M,) or مِعْرَاجٌ,
(Msb,) upon which one ascends; (S, Mgh;) either
of wood or of clay [&c.]: (Mgh:) said by Zj to
be so called because it delivers thee (يُسَلِّمُكَ) to
the place to which thou desirest to go, (Mgh,
TA,) i. e., to some high place, and thou hopest
for safety (السَّلَامَة) by means of it: (Er-Rághib,
TA:) masc. and fem.; (Lth, M, Mgh;) [app.,
accord. to Lth and F, generally fem.; for] accord.
to Lth, one says, هِىَ السُّلَّمُ and هُوَ السُّلَّمُ; (Mgh;)
[and F says,] it is sometimes made masc.: (K:)
pl. سَلَالِيمُ (S, Mgh, K) and سَلَالِمُ, (K,) [which
latter is the original, for] the ى in سَلَالِيمُ is added
by poetic license. (M, TA.) [Hence,] السُّلَّمُ
(assumed tropical:)  Certain stars, below [those called] العَانَةُ, on the
right of them; (K;) as being likened to the سُلَّم
[above-mentioned]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And The غَرْز [or
stirrup of the camel's saddle] (S, K) is sometimes
thus called [as being a means of mounting]. (S.)
―
-b3-  And (tropical:)  A means to a thing; (K, TA;) because
it leads to another thing like as does the سُلَّم upon
which one ascends. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And السُّلَّمُ is the
name of The horse of Zebbán (in the CK Zeiyán)
Ibn-Seiyár. (K.)
سَالِمٌ: see سَلِيمٌ; and see سَلَامٌ, near the middle
of the paragraph. [See also an ex. voce شَاجِبٌ.]
―
-b2-  [Hence,] كَلِمَةٌ سَالِمَةُ العَيْنَيْنِ (tropical:)  A good word
or expression or sentence. (TA.)
-A2-  The saying
of J [in the S], (K,) in which he has followed
his maternal uncle El-Fárábee, (TA,) that it
signifies The portion of skin between the eye
and the nose, is a mistake; (IB, K;) and his
citation, as an authority, of the verse of 'AbdAllah Ibn-'Omar (K) in which he says,
وَجِلْدَةُ بَيْنَ العَيْنِ وَالأَنْفِ سَالِمُ
(TA,) is futile: (K:) for, as IB says, Sálim was
the son of Ibn-'Omar, who, by reason of his love
of him, thus makes him to be as the skin between
his eyes and his nose: or, as MF says, the truth is,
that the said verse is by Zuheyr, and Ibn-'Omar
used it as a proverb: and [SM says], if this be
correct, it strengthens the saying of J. (TA.)
أَسْلَمُ [More, and most, safe or secure or free
from evils of any kind]. You say, هٰذَا أَسْلَمُ مِنْ
هٰذَا [This is more safe &c. than this]: and هٰذَا
الأَسْلَمُ [This is the most safe &c.]; and هٰذِهِ
السُّلْمَى. (Ham p. 214.)
-A2-  And الاسلم [app.
الأَسْلَمُ] signifies, like الطفى [i. e. الطَّفْىُ]; The
leaves (خُوص) of the دَوْم [or Theban palm].
(Ibn-Beytár, app. from AHn, cited by De Sacy
in his Chrest. Arabe, 2nd ed., iii. 480.)
الإِسْلَامُ [inf. n. of 4, q. v. ―

A poet of the class next after the مُخَضْرَمُون and
