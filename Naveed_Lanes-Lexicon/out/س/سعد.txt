latter is a simple subst.; (Msb;) He (a man, S,

happy, or in a state of felicity; (S, MA, Msb,
TA;) contr. of شَقِىَ; (S, * Msb, K *) with
respect to religion and with respect to worldly
things. (Msb.) You say, سَعِدْتُ بِهِ and سُعِدْتُ
[I was, or became, prosperous, &c., by means of
him, or it]. (A.) In the Kur xi. 110, Ks read
سُعِدُوا [instead of the common reading سَعِدُوا].
(S.) [See also سَعَادَةٌ, below.] ―
-b2-  And سَعَدَ يَوْمُنَا,
aor.
سَعَدَ, inf. n. سُعُودٌ (S, K) and سَعْدٌ, (K,) Our
day was, or became, prosperous, fortunate, auspicious, or lucky; (S, K;) [contr. of نَحِسَ; and

ساعدهُ, (A, L, Msb,) inf. n. مُسَاعَدَةٌ (S, L,
Msb) and سِعَادٌ; (L;) and ↓ اسعدهُ, (K,) inf. n.
إِسْعَادٌ; (S;) He aided, assisted, or helped, him;
syn. of the former عَاوَنَهُ, (S, * L, Msb,) and of the
latter أَعَانَهُ: (S, * K:) [like as is said of عَاوَنَهُ and
أَعَانَهُ,] both signify the same: or مُسَاعَدَةٌ signifies the aiding, or assisting, or helping, in any
manner or case; and is said to be from a man's
putting his arm, or hand, upon the سَاعِد [or fore
arm] of his companion when they walk together
to accomplish some object of want, and aid each
other to do a thing: [so that سَاعَدَهُ more properly signifies he aided him, being aided by him:
but see سَاعِدٌ:] whereas ↓ إِسْعَادٌ signifies specially
a woman's aiding, assisting, or helping, another
to wail for a dead person: so says El-Khattábee:
and this is what is meant in a trad. in which
اسعاد is forbidden. (L.) One says, ساعدهُ عَلَيْهِ
[He aided, assisted, or helped him against him,
or it, or to do it]: and النَّائِحَةُ الثَّكْلَى ↓ أَسْعَدَتِ
The wailing-woman assisted the woman bereft of
her child to weep and wail. (A.) Accord. to Fr,
[but this is questionable,] the primary signification of مُسَاعَدَةٌ and ↓ إِسْعَادٌ is A man's performing diligently the command and good pleasure of
God. (L.)
4
اسعدهُ اللّٰهُ, [inf. n. إِسْعَادٌ,] God rendered him
prosperous, fortunate, happy, or in a state of
felicity; (S, Msb, K;) as also ↓ سَعَدَهُ, aor.

made his good fortune to increase; as also ↓ سَعَدَ
جَدَّهُ. (L.) And accord. to Az, اسعدهُ اللّٰهُ and
↓ سَعَدَهُ signify God aided, assisted, or helped,
him; and accommodated, adapted, or disposed,
him to the right course. (L, TA.) See also 3, in
four places.
5
تسعّد He sought after the plant called
سَعْدَان. (K.)
10
استسعد بِهِ He deemed it, or reckoned it,
fortunate, auspicious, or lucky. (K.) You say,
استسعد بِرُؤْيَةِ فُلَانٍ He deemed, or reckoned, the
sight of such a one fortunate, auspicious, or lucky.
(S.) ―

or it. (MA.) ―
-b3-  He sought good fortune by
means of him, or it. (MA.) ―
-b4-  [And استسعدهُ

for] اِسْتِسْعَادٌ also signifies the desiring, or demanding, aid or assistance [of another]. (KL.)
سَعْدٌ an inf. n. of سَعِدَ, (Msb,) or of سُعِدَ,
(MA,) or of both: (TA:) and of سَعَدَ: (K,
TA:) [and also used as a simple subst.:] see
سَعَادَةٌ [with which it is syn.]: and see also سُعُودَةٌ
[with which it is likewise syn.]; i. q. يُمْنٌ. (S,
A.) ―
-b2-  It is also an inf. n. used as an epithet,
i. e. Prosperous, fortunate, auspicious, or lucky,
applied to a day, and to a star or an asterism [&c.:
so that it may be used alike as masc. and fem.
and sing. and pl.: but it is also used as originally
an epithet, forming its fem. with ة; and in this
case it has for pl. of mult. سُعُودٌ and pl. of pauc.
أَسْعُدٌ]: you say يَوْمٌ سَعْدٌ, as well as يَوْمُ سَعْدٍ [in
which it is used as a subst.]; and كَوْكَبٌ سَعْدٌ:
and IJ mentions لَيْلَةٌ سَعْدَةٌ, in which سَعْدَةٌ is like
جَعْدَةٌ as fem. of جَعْدٌ. (L.) ―
-b3-  [Hence,] السَّعْدَانِ
is an appellation of The two planets Venus and
Mercury: like as [the contr.] النَّحْسَانِ is applied
to Saturn and Mars. (Ibn-'Abbád, TA in art.
نحس.) ―
-b4-  And [hence, also,] سَعْدٌ is an appellation given to Each of ten asterisms, (S, L, K,)
four of which are in the signs of Capricornus
and Aquarius, (S, L,) and are Mansions of the
Moon: pl. [of mult.] سُعُودٌ (S, L, K) and سُعُدٌ;
but the former is the more known, and more
agreeable with analogy; and pl. of pauc. أَسْعُدٌ:
(L:) they are distinguished by the following
names: — سَعْدُ الذَّابِحِ, (S, L, K,) [or سَعْدٌ الذَّابِحُ,
see art. ذبح,] Two stars near together, one of
which is called الذابح because with it is a small
obscure star, almost close to it, and it seems as
though the former were about to slaughter it;
and الذابح is a little brighter that it; (Ibn-Kunáseh;) they are the two stars [
α and
β] which
are in one of the horns of Capricornus; so called
because of the small adjacent star, which is said
to be the sheep (شاة) of الذابح, which he is about
to slaughter; the Twenty-second Mansion of the
Moon: (Kzw:) [see also art. ذبح:] ―
-b5-  سَعْدُ بُلَعَ
(S, L, K) Two obscure stars, lying obliquely, of
which Aboo-Yahyà says, the Arabs assert that they
rose [at dawn] when God said, يَا أَرْضُ ابْلَعِى مَآءَكِ
[Kur xi. 46]; and said to be thus called because
one of them seems as though about to swallow
the other, on account of its nearness to it: (Ibn-Kunáseh:) or three stars [app.
ε and
μ with the
star of the same magnitude next to them on the
north] on [or rather near] the left hand of Aquarius; [the Twenty-third Mansion of the Moon:]
(Kzw, descr. of Aquarius:) [See also art. بلع:]
―
-b6-  سَعْدُ السُّعُودِ (S, L, K) Two stars, the most approved of the سُعُود, and therefore thus named,
resembling سعد الذابح [app. a mistake for سَعْدُ
البَارِعِ, or some other سعد, not of the Mansions of
the Moon,] in the time of their [auroral] rising;
(Ibn-Kunáseh;) the star [
β] which is on the left
shoulder-joint of Aquarius, together with the star
[
δ] in the tail of Capricornus; [the Twentyfourth Mansion of the Moon:] (Kzw, descr. of
Aquarius:) or a certain solitary bright star:
(S:) ―
-b7-  سَعْدُ الأَخْبِيَةِ (S, L, K) [also called الأَخْبِيَةُ
and الخِبَآءُ (see خِبَآءٌ in art. خبى)] Three stars, not
in the track of the other سُعُود, but declining from
it [a little], in, or respecting, which there is a
discordance; they are neither very obscure nor
very bright; and are thus called because, when
they rise [aurorally], the venomous or noxious
reptiles of the earth, such as scorpions and serpents, come forth from their holes; (Ibn-Kuná-
seh;) [and this observation is just; for this
asterism, about the commencement of the era of
the Flight, rose aurorally, in Central Arabia, on
the 24th of February, O. S., after the end of the
cold season: see مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ, in art. نزل:] or it
consists of three stars, like the three stones upon
which the cooking-pot is placed, with a fourth
below one of them; (S;) the star [g] that is on
the right arm, together with the three stars [
ζ,
η,
and
π,] on the right hand of Aquarius: so called
because, when it rises [aurorally], the venomous
or noxious reptiles that have hidden themselves
beneath the ground by reason of the cold appear:
(Kzw, descr. of Aquarius; [in some copies, incorrectly, for “ that have hidden themselves,” &c.,
“ hide themselves beneath the ground by reason
of the cold: ”]) it is said that the سعد is one star,
the brightest of four, the other three of which are
obscure; and it is [correctly] said to be called
thus because, when it rises [aurorally], the venomous or noxious reptiles that are hidden beneath
the ground come forth: it is the Twenty-fifth
Mansion of the Moon: (Kzw, descr. of the Mansions of the Moon:) ―
-b8-  the following are the other
سعود, which are not Mansions of the Moon: (S,
L, K:) ―
-b9-  سَعْدُ نَاشِرَةَ (S, L, K) [Two stars, situate,
accord. to Ideler, as is said in Freytag's Lex., in

Aquarius: (Kzw:) ―
-b11-  سَعْدُ البِهَامِ (S, L, K) The
two stars [

θ?] on the head of Pegasus:

is written سَعْدُ البَهَائِمِ:]) ―
-b12-  سَعْدُ الهُمَامِ (S, L, K)
The two stars [
ζ and 31 ?] on the neck of Pegasus: (Kzw:) سَعْدُ البَارِعِ (S, L, K) The two
stars near together [
μ and and
λ?] in the breast of
Pegasus: (Kzw:) ―
-b13-  سَعْدُ مَطَرٍ (S, L, K) The
two stars [
η and
ο ?] on the right [or left ?] knee of
Pegasus: (Kzw: but there called سَعْدُ المَطَرِ:)
―
-b14-  each سعد of these six consists of two stars:
between every two stars, as viewed by the eye, is
[said to be] a distance of a cubit, (ذِرَاع,) (S, L,)
or about a cubit; (K;) [but this is not correct;]
and they are disposed in regular order. (S, L.)
―
-b15-  It is also the name of A certain object of
idolatrous worship that belonged to the sons of
Milkán (S, K) the son of Kináneh, (S,) in a
place on the shore of the sea, adjacent to Juddeh.
(TA.) A poet says,
وَهَلْ سَعْدُ إِلَّا صَخْرَةٌ بِتَنُوفَةٍ
مِنَ الأَرْضِ لَا تَدْعُو لِغَىٍّ وَلَا رُشْدِ
[And is Saad aught but a mass of rock in a
desert tract of the earth, not inviting to error
nor to a right course?]. (S, TA.) Hudheyl is
said to have worshipped it in the Time of Ignorance. (TA.) ―
-b16-  بِنْتُ سَعْدٍ is metonymically used
as meaning (tropical:)  The virginity, or hymen, of a girl or
woman. (TA.) ―
-b17-  ↓ أَسَعْدٌ أَمْ سُعَيْدٌ, meaning (tropical:)  Is
it a thing liked or a thing disliked? (S, A, K,)
is a prov., (S, A,) which [is said to have] originated from the fact that Saad and So'eyd, [the
latter name erroneously written in some copies of
the S and K سَعِيد,] the two sons of Dabbeh the
son of Udd, went forth (S, K, TA) to seek some
camels belonging to them, (TA,) and Saad returned, but So'eyd was lost, and his name became
regarded as unlucky: (S, K, TA:) Dabbeh used
to say this when he saw a dark object in the
night: and hence it is said in allusion to care for
one's relation; and in inquiring whether a good
or an evil event have happened. (TA.) [The
saying may also be rendered, Is it a fortunate
thing or a little fortunate thing?] ―
-b18-  سَعْدَيْكَ, in
the saying لَبَّيْكَ وَسَعْدَيْكَ, signifies Aiding Thee
after aiding [i. e. time after time]; syn. إِسْعَادًا
لَكَ بَعْدَ إِسْعَادٍ: (ISk, T, S, L, K:) or aiding Thee
and then aiding: (Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà, L:) or
aiding thy cause after aiding [i. e. time after
time]: (T, L:) and hence it is in the dual
number: (IAth, L:) El-Jarmee says that it has
no sing.; and Fr says the same of it, and also of
لَبَّيْكَ: it is in the accus. case as an inf. n. governed
by a verb understood. (L.) It occurs in the form
of words preceding the recitation of the Opening
Chapter of the Kur-án in prayer, لَبَّيْكَ وَسَعْدَيْكَ
وَالخَيْرُ بَيْنَ يَدَيْكَ وَالسَّرُّ لَيْسَ إِلَيْكَ [meaning I wait
intent upon thy service, or upon obedience to Thee,
time after time, and upon aiding thy cause time
after time; and good is before Thee, and evil is
not imputable to Thee]. (L, TA.)
-A2-  Also The

(S, K,) well known: (K:) or the former is pl. of
↓ سُعْدَةٌ, [or rather a coll. gen. n. of which سُعْدَةٌ
is the n. un.,] and this last is [the name of] a
certain kind of sweet-smelling root; it is a rhizoma (أَرُومَة), round, black, hard, like a knot;
which forms an ingredient in perfumes and medicines: (AHn:) and ↓ سُعَادَى is the name of its
plant; (Lth, AHn;) and its pl. is سُعَادَيَاتٌ:
(AHn:) or the سُعْد is a certain plant having a
root (أَصْل) beneath the ground, black, and of
sweet odour: and the ↓ سُعَادَى is another plant:
(Az:) [in the present day, the former of these
two names (سُعْد) is applied to a species of cyperus:
a species thereof is termed by Forskål (in his
Flora Aegypt. Arab, pp. lx. and 14,) cyperus
complanatus; and he writes its Arabic name
“ sæad ” and “ sææd: ”] it has a wonderful efficacy applied to ulcers, or sores, that heal with
difficulty. (K.)

دُرُوعٌ سَعْدِيَّةٌ Coats of mail of the fabric of a

pastures of camels, (S, K,) as long as it continues
fresh; (TA;) having [a head of] prickles, (T,
S, K,) called حَسَكَةُ السَّعْدَانِ, (T, S,) to which the
nipple [or the areola] of a woman's breast is
likened: (S, K: [see سَعْدَانَةٌ, below:]) the Arabs
say that the camels that yield the sweetest milk
are those that eat this plant: (TA:) and they
fatten upon it: (Az, TA:) it is of the kind of
plants called أَحْرَار [pl. of حُرٌّ, meaning slender,
and succulent or soft  or sweet], dust-coloured, and
sweet, and eaten by everything that is not large,
[as well as by camels,] and it is one of the most
wholesome kinds of pasture: (AHn, TA:) it is a
herb, or leguminous plant, having a round fruit
with a prickly face, which, when it dries, falls
upon the ground on its back, and when a person
walking treads upon it, the prickles wound his
foot: it is one of the best of their pastures in the
days of the رِبيع, and sweetens the milk of the
camels that feed upon it; for it is sweet as long
as it continues fresh; and in this state men such
it and eat it: (Az, L:) the n. un. is with ة.
(TA.) Hence the prov., مَرْعًى وَلَا كَالسَّعْدَانِ

of a thing possessing excellence, but surpassed in
excellence by another thing; or of a thing that
