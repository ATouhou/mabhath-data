سوأ1
سَآءَ, (Lth, M, Msb, K,) aor. يَسُوْءُ, (Lth, Msb,)
inf. n. سَوْءٌ, (Lth, M,) or سَوَآءٌ, like سَحَابٌ, (K,)
[but the former is that which is commonly known,]
It (a thing, Lth, M) was, or became, evil, bad,
abominable, foul, unseemly, unsightly, or ugly.
(Lth, M, Msb, K.) It is used in this sense, (IKt,
TA,) or [rather] is like بِئْسَ, (Bd, Jel,) in the
Kur [xvii. 34], where it is said, سَآءَ سَبِيلًا [Evil,
&c., is it as a way of acting]: (IKt, Bd, Jel,
TA:) which is like the saying, سَآءَ هٰذَا مَذْهَبًا
[Evil, &c., is this as a way of acting or believing,
&c.]: the noun being in the accus. case as a
specificative. (IKt, TA.) And so in the saying,
سَآءَ مَا فَعَلَ فُلَانٌ صَنِيعًا [Evil, &c., as an action,
is that which such a one has done]. (TA.) ―
-b2-
One says also, سُؤْتُ بِهِ ظَنًّا, and بِهِ الظَّنَّ ↓ أَسَأْتُ,
[lit. I was evil in opinion respecting him, or it,
and I made the opinion respecting him, or it, to
be evil, each virtually meaning I held, or formed,
an evil opinion respecting him, or it,] the noun
being determinate, with the article ال, in the
latter case, (ISk, S, Msb, TA,) because it is an
objective complement, for the verb is trans., (IB,
TA,) and the noun being indeterminate in the
former case, (IB, Msb, TA,) because it is in the
accus. case as a specificative; (IB, TA;) but
some allow it to be indeterminate after ↓ أَسَأْتُ,
which is here the contr. of أَحْسَنْتُ. (Msb.)
-A2-
It is also trans.: (Lth, TA:) you say, سَآءَهُ, (S,
M, K,) aor. يَسُوْؤُهُ, (S,) inf. n. سَوْءٌ (S, M, K) and
(??), with damm also, (TA, [and said to be an
(??)n. in the Ksh and by Bd in ii. 46, but as it is
(??)entioned as an inf. n. in the S nor in the M
(??) the K, but is expressly said in all these to
(??)st., I think that is should be rejected, or
(??) as a quasi-inf. n. like كَلَامٌ and ثَوَابٌ
(??) سَوَآةٌ (K) and سَوَآءَةٌ (AZ, M, K) and
(??), K,) of the measure فَعَالِيَةٌ, like
(??) M,) and سَوَايَةٌ, (S, M, K,) which
is a contraction of that next preceding, (Kh, S,
M,) and مَسَآءٌ (M, K) and مَسَآءَةٌ, (S, M, K,) originally مَسْوَأَةٌ, (Har p. 81,) and مَسَائِيَةٌ, which is
originally مَسَاوِئَةٌ, (Kh, S, M, K,) and مَسَايَةٌ,
(S, M, K,) which is a contraction of that next
preceding, (Kh, S,) and مَسَائِيَّةٌ, (M, K,) this last
written in the L with two ى s, [i. e. مَسَاييَِةٌ,]
(TA,) [He did evil to him;] he did to him that
which he disliked, or hated; (M, K;) he displeased, grieved, or vexed, him; contr. of سَرَّهُ.
(S.) One says, سُؤْتُ الرَّجُلَ, meaning I displeased,
grieved, or vexed, the man by what he saw [or
experienced] from me. (S.) And أَرَدْتُ مَسَآءَتَكَ
and مَسَائِيَتَكَ [I desired to displease, grieve, or vex,
thee]. (Lth, TA.) And إِنَّ اللَّيْلَ طَوِيلٌ وَلَا يَسُؤْ
بَالُهُ [Verily the night is long, and may the state
thereof not displease, grieve, or vex, me]: meaning لَا يَسُؤْنِى بَالُهُ; and expressing a prayer. (Lh,
M. [In the TA, in the place of بَالُهُ is put ما له;
as though meaning مَا لَهُ مِنَ الحَوَادِثِ or the like,
i. e. its events, or accidents, &c.]) And لَهُ عِنْدِي
مَا سَآءَهُ وَنَآءَهُ [I have, belonging to him, or I owe
him, what grieved him, and oppressed him by its
weight], and مَا يَسُوْؤُهُ وَيَنُوْؤُهُ [what does, or will,
grieve him, &c.]. (S.) تَرَكَ مَا يَسُوْؤُهُ وَيَنُوْؤُهُ [He
left, or has left, what will grieve him, and oppress
him by its weight, on the day of judgment, by the
responsibility that it has imposed upon him,] is a
prov., said of him who has left his property to his
heirs. (Meyd, TA.) It is said that El-Mahboobee
was possessed of riches; and when death visited
him, he desired to make a testament; so it was
said to him, “What wilt thou write? ” and he
answered, “Write ye, 'Such a one,' meaning
himself, 'has left what will grieve him, and oppress him by its weight:' ” i. e., property which
his heirs will devour, while the burden thereof
will remain upon him. (Meyd, TA.) [See also 4.]
―
-b2-  One says also, سُؤْتُ وَجْهَ فُلَانٍ, aor. أَسُوْؤُهُ,
inf. n. مَسَآءَةٌ and مَسَائِيَةٌ, (Lth, TA,) i. q. قَبَحْتُهُ
[i. e. I said, May God remove the person (lit.
the face) of such a one far from good, or prosperity, &c.]. (TA. [It is said in a copy of the
M, that سُؤْتُ لَهُ وَجْهَهُ means قَبَّحْتُهُ: but I think
that the right explanation is قَبَحْتُهُ, without tesh-deed, meaning I said to him, قَبَحَ اللّٰهُ وَجْهَكَ: see
art. قبح.])
2
سوّأ [He corrupted, or marred]. You say,
سَوِّ وَلَا تُسَوِّئْ Rectify thou, and do not corrupt, or
mar. (A, TA.) [See also 4.] ―
-b2-  سوّأ عَلَيْهِ He said
to him أَسَأْتُ [Thou hast done ill]. (M.) You say,
سَوَّأْتُ عَلَيْهِ مَا صَنَعَ, (S,) or صَنِيعَهُ, (K,) i. e. فِعْلَهُ,
(TA,) inf. n. تَسْوِئَةٌ and تَسْوِىْءٌ, I discommended to
him what he had done, or his deed; and said to him
أَسَأْتَ [Thou hast done ill]. (S, K.) And إِنْ أَسَأْتُ
فَسَوِّئْ عَلَىَّ [If I do ill, say thou to me, Thou hast
done ill]. (S.)
4
أَسَآءَ, [inf. n. إِسَآءَةٌ,] He did evil, or ill; or
acted ill; contr. of أَحْسَنَ: (S, M, K:) [and so]
اسِآء فِى فِعْلِهِ. (Msb.) You say, اسآء إِلَيْهِ (S, K)
and لَهُ and عَلَيهِ and بِهِ (TA) He did evil or ill,
or acted ill, to him. (S, K, TA.) ―
-b2-  [See also
أَسْوَى, in several senses, in art. سوي.]
-A2-  اسآءهُ
He corrupted it, or marred it; (M, K;) [did it
ill;] did it not well; namely, a thing. (M.) It
is said in a prov., أَسَآءَ كَارِهٌ مَا عَمِلَ [An unwilling
person did ill what he did]; relating to a man
who was compelled against his will, by another,
to do a thing, and marred it, or did it not well: it
is applied to the man who seeks an object of want
and does not take pains to accomplish it. (M,
Meyd. *) See also 1, in two places, in the former
half of the paragraph. [And see 2.]
8
استآء He experienced evil, or that which he
disliked or hated, (S, * K, TA,) or displeasure,
(TA,) or grief, or anxiety. (M, TA.) اِسْتَآءَ لَهَا
occurs in a trad. as meaning He (the Prophet)
became displeased, or grieved, or anxious, on
account of it; i. e., on account of a dream that
had been related to him: or, accord. to one relation, the right reading is اِسْتَآلَهَا, meaning “ he
sought the interpretation of it, by consideration. ”
(TA.)
سَوْءٌ is an inf. n. of سَآءَ, (Lth, S, M, K,) intrans.,
(Lth, M,) and trans.: (S, M, K:) and is also used
as an epithet, applied to a man, (M, Msb, and
Ham p. 712,) and to an action. (Msb.) You
say رَجُلُ سَوْءٍ (S, M, Msb, K) [A man of evil
nature or doings; or] a man who does what is
evil, displeasing, grievous, or vexatious: (M, TA:)
and رَجُلُ السَّوْءِ [the man of evil nature or doings
&c.]: (S, K:) and ذِئْبُ السَّوْءِ [the wolf of evil
nature &c.], as in a verse cited voce أَحَالَ, in art.
حول: (S:) and عَمَلُ سَوْءٍ [a deed of evil nature]:
(M, Msb:) and عَمَلُ السَّوْءِ [the deed of evil
nature]: (Ham p. 498:) and نَعْتُ سَوْءٍ [an epithet of evil nature]: (O and K in art. سحق:)
and سَعْفُ سَوْءٍ a bad commodity: (O and TA in
art. سعف:) and if you make the former word
determinate [by means of the article ال], you use
the latter as an epithet [also], (M, * Msb, and
Ham, p. 712, *) and you say الرَّجُلُ السَّوْءُ [the evil
man, or the man who does what is evil &c.]:
(Msb, and Ham p. 712:) and العَمَلُ السَّوْءُ [the
evil deed]: (Msb:) [this last phrase I hold to be
correct, regarding السَّوْءُ in this case as originally
an inf. n. of the intrans. verb سَآءَ, and therefore
capable of being used as an epithet applied to
anything; though] IB says that السَّوْءُ used as an
epithet is applied to a man but not to a deed:
(TA:) [in what here follows from the S, denying
the correctness of another phrase mentioned above
on the authority of lexicologists of high repute,
there is, in my opinion, an obvious mistranscription, twice occurring, السَّوْءُ for السُّوْءُ, which I
suppose to have passed from an early copy of that
work into most other copies thereof, for I find it
alike in all to which I have had access:] Akh
says, one should not say الرَّجُلُ السَّوْءُ, though one
says الحَقُّ اليَقِينُ as well as حَقُّ اليَقِينِ; for السَّوْءُ
is not the same as الرَّجُلُ, but اليَقِينُ is the same
as الحَقُّ: he says, also, nor should one say, هٰذَا
رَجُلُ السُّوْءِ with damm: (S:) [here the expres-
sion “ with damm ” may perhaps be meant to
refer to السوء in all of the three instances above;
not in the last only:] IB says, [in remarking on
this passage of the S, in which he appears to have
read السُّوْء, with damm, in all of the three instances,] Akh allows one's saying رَجُلُ السَّوْءِ and
رَجُلُ سَوْءٍ, with fet-h to the س in both; but not
رَجُلُ السُّوْءِ, with damm to the س, because السُّوْءُ
is a subst., meaning “ harm, injury, hurt, mischief, or damage,” and “ evilness of state or condition; ” and رَجُل is prefixed, as governing a
gen. case, only to the inf. n.: and he adds that
one says, هٰذَا الرَّجُلُ السَّوْءُ, not prefixing [the
former noun to the latter, but using the latter as
an epithet]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  See also the next paragraph, in six places.
سُوْءٌ is the subst. from سَآءَهُ; (S, M, * K;) [so,
app., accord. to the generality of the lexicologists;]
or inf. n. (Ksh and Bd in ii. 46) of سَيِّئٌ, (Ksh
ibid.,) or of سَآءَ, aor. يَسُوْءُ, (Bd ibid.,) or of سَآءَهُ
[q. v.]; (TA;) signifying Evilness, badness, abominableness, foulness, or unseemliness; [and displeasingness, grievousness, or vexatiousness;] as,
for instance, of natural disposition, and of doings:
(Ksh ubi suprà:) vitious, immoral, unrighteous,
sinful, or wicked, conduct: [hence, رَمَاهُ بِسُوْءٍ: see
art. رمي:] anything disapproved, or disallowed;
or regarded as evil, bad, abominable, foul, or
unseemly: (S, TA:) [an evil action or event:]
evilness of state or condition: harm, injury, hurt,
mischief, or damage: (IB, TA:) anything that
is mentioned as being سَيِّئ [i. e. evil, &c.]: (Lth,
TA:) any evil, evil affection, cause of mischief
or harm or injury, noxious or destructive thing,
calamity, disease, or malady: (M, K, TA:) [pl.
أَسْوَآءٌ, accord. to a general rule.] The saying
مَا أُنْكِرُكَ مِنْ سُوْءٍ means I do not disacknowledge
thee in consequence of سُوْء [i. e. evilness, &c.,] that I
have seen in thee, but only in consequence of my
little knowledge of thee. (S.) لِنَصْرِفَ عَنْهُ السُّوْءَ
وَالفَحْشَآءَ, in the Kur [xii. 24], is said by Zj to
mean, [In order that we might turn away from
him] unfaithfulness to his master, and adultery.
(M, TA.) And سُوْءُ الحِسَابِ, in the Kur [xiii. 18,
i. e. The evilness of the reckoning], is expl. by
him as meaning a reckoning in which no good
work will be accepted, and no evil work passed
over; because infidelity will have made the former
to be of no avail: or, as some say, it means a
reckoning pursued to the utmost extent, in which
no evil work will be passed over. (M, TA.) لَا
خَيْرَ فِى قَوْلِ السُّوْءِ means There is no good in thy
saying سُوْء [i. e. a thing that is evil; قول being
here used in its original sense of an inf. n.]: but
if you say ↓ السَّوْء, [you use قول in the sense of
مَقُول, and] the meaning is, in evil speech. (TA
as from the K, but not in the CK nor in my MS.
copy of the K.) سُوْءٌ accord. to one reading, and
↓ سَوْءٌ accord. to another, (K, TA, [but all that is
given in this sentence as from the K is so given
only on the authority of the TA, not being in the
CK nor in my MS. copy of the K]) the latter of
which readings is the more common, (TA,) in the
phrase دَائِرَةُ السّوء, (K, TA,) in the Kur [ix. 99
and xlviii. 6], (TA,) mean Defeat, and evil;
(K, TA;) and trial, or affliction, and torment;
(TA;) and perdition, and destruction, or corruption: (K, TA:) and in like manner in the
saying, أُمْطِرَتْ مَطَرَ السّوءِ, (K, TA,) in the Kur
[xxv. 42]: (TA:) or السُّوْء means harm, injury,
hurt, mischief, or damage; and evilness of state
or condition; [as expl. before;] and ↓ السَّوْء, corruption, or destruction, or perdition: (K, * TA:)
or السُّوْء in the phrase دَائِرَةُ السُّوْءِ means defeat and
evil; and the reading ↓ السَّوْء is from [i. e. syn.
with] المَسَآءَة [as inf. n.]. (S. [See also دَائِرَةٌ, in
art. دور.]) Accord. to Zj, in the saying in the
Kur [xlviii. 6], ↓ الظَّانِّينَ بِاللّٰهِ ظَنَّ السَّوْءِ, (TA,)
meaning ظَنَّ الأَمْرِ السَّوْءِ [i. e. Who opine, of God,
the opining of the evil thing], (Bd,) it is allowable
to read ظَنَّ السُّوْءِ; (T, TA;) and thus some read
in this instance: (Jel:) but AM says, in the
saying in the Kur [xlviii. 12], ↓ وَظَنَنْتُمْ ظَنَّ السَّوْءِ
[And ye opined the evil opining], it is read only
with fet-h, and damm to the س is not allowable
in this instance, for there is in it no meaning of
trial, or affliction, and torment: (TA:) [for this
distinction, however, I see no reason; and it is
not correct; for] السوء is with fet-h and with
damm to the س in the three sentences [whereof
this last is one] in which it occurs in this chapter.
(Jel.) ―
-b2-  In the Kur vii. 188, it is said to mean
(assumed tropical:)  Diabolical possession; or insanity, or madness.
(M, TA.) ―
-b3-  (tropical:)  Leprosy, syn. بَرَصٌ, (Lth, S, M,
K, TA,) is said to be its meaning in the Kur
xx. 23 and xxvii. 12 and xxviii. 32. (S, TA.) ―
-b4-
(assumed tropical:)  The fire: so in the Kur xxx. 9, accord. to the
reading السُّوْءَ: (K, TA:) said to mean there Hell:
but the reading commonly known is ↓ السُّوْءَى.
(TA.) ―
-b5-  And (assumed tropical:)  Weakness in the eye. (K. [Thus,
i. e. with damm to the س, in the CK and TK:
in the TA said to be بالفتح; but this is evidently
a mistake for بالضمّ.])
سَىْءٌ: see سَيِّئٌ.
سَوْءَةٌ The عَوْرَة [or pudendum], (S, Mgh, Msb,)
i. e. (Msb) the فَرْج [which means the same, or
the external portion of the organs of generation],
(Lth, M, IAth, Msb, K,) of a man, and of a
woman: (Lth, Msb, TA:) and the anus: (Az
and TA in art. سوى:) dual سَوْءَتَانِ: and pl.
سَوْآتٌ: so called because its becoming exposed to
men displease [or shames] the owner thereof;
(Msb;) or because of its unseemliness. (Ham
p. 510.) In the Kur vii. 19, for سَوْآتِهِمَا, some
read سَوَاتِهِمَا; and some, سَوَّاتِهِمَا. (Bd.) ―
-b2-  In the
Kur v. 34, it means The dead body, or corpse;
(Bd, Jel;) because it is deemed unseemly to be
seen. (Bd.) ―
-b3-  Accord. to IAth, the former is the
primary signification: and hence it is transferred
to denote Any saying, or action, of which one is
ashamed when it appears: (TA:) any evil, bad,
abominable, foul, or unseemly, saying or action;
(S, K, TA;) as also ↓ سَوْآءُ: (M:) any disgracing
action or thing: (Lth, TA:) an evil, abominable,
or unseemly, property, quality, custom, or practics; (K, TA;) as also ↓ سَوْآءُ, or ↓ سَوْءَى; (accord. to different copies of the K; [the latter
perhaps fem. of ↓ أَسْوَأُ like the former, of the same
class as دَفْأَى and دَنْأَى, or fem. of ↓ سَوْآنُ, like
عَطْشَى fem. of عَطْشَانُ;]) or so both of these;
(TA;) or so ↓ سَوْءَةٌ سَوْآءُ: (S:) [or this last means
a property, &c., that is very evil &c.] One says,
سَوْءَةً لِفُلَانٍ May a disgracing action or thing
befall such a one; [or disgrace, or shame, to such
a one;] using the accus. case because it is an expression of reviling and imprecation. (Lth, TA.)
[See also سَيِّئَةٌ and سُوْءَى.] ―
-b4-  ↓ السَّوْءَةُ السَّوْءَى [or
↓ السَّوْءَةُ السَّوْآءُ] also means The contrarious wife
or woman. (TA.)
سَايَةٌ as used in the saying ضَرَبَ فُلَانٌ عَلَى فُلَانٍ
سَايَةً is held by some to be originally with ء, and
of the measure فَعْلَةٌ, from السَّوْءُ; so that the saying means Such a one did to such a one a thing
that caused displeasure to him; and did evil to
him: others hold that the saying means such a one
made a way to do what he desired to such a one;
in which case, ساية is of the measure فَعْلَةٌ from
سَوَّيْتُ; originally سَوْيَةٌ, which is changed into
سَيَّةٌ, and then into سَايَةٌ, in like manner as دِوَّانٌ
is changed into دِيوَانٌ. (Aboo-Bekr, TA.) [See
the same word in art. سوى.]
سَوْءَى: see سَوْءَةٌ, in two places.
سُوْءَى is [fem. of ↓ أَسْوَأُ, q. v., as meaning More,
and most, evil, bad, abominable, foul, unseemly,
unsightly, or ugly: and is also] a subst. signifying an evil, a bad, an abominable, a foul, or an
unseemly, action; (Msb, TA;) i. q. فَعْلَةٌ سَيِّئَةٌ
[and سَيِّئَةٌ alone]: in this sense, [as well as in the
former,] (TA,) contr. of حُسْنَى. (S, M, K, TA.)
―
-b2-  In the Kur xxx. 9, (S, TA,) accord. to the
reading commonly known, (TA,) [as contr. of
الحُسْنَى,] السُّوْءَى means (assumed tropical:)  The fire (S, K, TA)
of Hell. (TA.) See also سُوْءٌ, last explanation
but one.
سَوْآءُ: see أَسْوَأُ (of which it is said by some to
be fem.) in two places: ―
-b2-  and see also سَوْءَةٌ, in
four places.
خَزْيَانُ سَوْآنُ is [app. an instance of the alteration of the latter of two epithets to assimilate it to
the former, originally خَزْيَانُ أَسْوَأُ, meaning
Ashamed, or base, or vile, or ignominious, and
evil, bad, &c.,] from القُبْحُ. (M, TA.) ―
-b2-  See also
سَوْءَةٌ.
سَيِّئٌ, [originally سَيْوِئٌ (as will be shown below,
voce سَيِّئَةٌ), then سَيْيِئٌ, and then سَيِّئٌ,] applied to
a thing [of any kind], (Lth, TA,) Evil, bad,
abominable, foul, unseemly, unsightly, or ugly;
(Lth, Msb, TA;) contr. of حَسَنٌ: (Msb:) sometimes contracted into ↓ سَىْءٌ, like as هَيِّنٌ is contracted in هَيْنٌ, and لَيّنٌ into لَيْنٌ; as in the
saying of Et-Tuhawee,
وَلَا يَجْزُونَ مِنْ حَسَنٍ مِسَىْءٍ
وَلَا يَجْزُونَ مِنْ غِلَظٍ بِلِينِ
[And they will not requite good with evil, nor
will they requite roughness with gentleness]. (S.)
You say قَوْلٌ سَيِّئٌ [An evil saying; or] a saying
that displeases. (M, TA.) And فَعْلَةٌ سَيِّئَةٌ [An
evil action or deed]. (TA.) And it is said in the
Kur [xxxv. 41], وَمَكْرَ السَّيِّئِ وَلَا يَحِيقُ الْمَكْرُ السَّيِّئٌ
إِلَّا بِأَهْلِهِ [And in the plotting of that which is
evil; but the evil plotting shall not beset any save
the authors thereof]. (M, TA.) One says also,
فُلَانٌ سَيِّئُ الاِخْتِيَارِ [Such a one is evil in respect
of choice, or preference]. (S.) [See also the next
paragraph.]
سَيِّئَةٌ [fem. of سَيِّئٌ, q. v.: and also a subst.,
being transferred from the category of epithets
to that of substs. by the affix ة], originally
سَيْوِئَةٌ, (S,) An evil act or action; contr. of حَسَنَةٌ;
(Msb;) a fault, an offence, or an act of disobedience; or such as is intentional; a sin, a crime,
or an act of disobedience for which one deserves
punishment; syn. خَطِيْئَةٌ: (M, K:) pl. سَيِّئَاتٌ.
(TA.) It is said in a trad., الحَسَنَةُ بَيْنَ السَّيِّئَتَيْنِ
[The good act is between the two evil acts];
meaning that the exceeding of the just bounds is
a سَيِّئَة, and the falling short thereof is a سَيِّئَة, and
the pursuing a middle course between these two
is a حَسَنَة. (TA.) [See also سَوْءَةٌ and سُوْءَى.] ―
-b2-
Also; tropically, (tropical:)  The recompense of a سَيِّئَة
properly so termed [i. e. as expl. above]. (Msb
in art. مكر.) ―
-b3-  An evil, or evil accident; a
calamity; a misfortune; (Ksh in iv. 81;) a
trial, or an affliction; opposed to حَسَنَةٌ; (Ksh
and Bd in iv. 80;) scarcity of herbage, or of the
goods, conveniences, and comforts, of life; straitness of circumstances; and unsuccessfulness; thus
[likewise] opposed to حَسَنَةٌ in the Kur iv. 80.
(Er- Rághib, TA in art. حسن.)
أَسْوَأُ; fem. سُوْءَى: see the latter word. One
says, هُوَ أَسْوَأُ القَوْمِ He is the most evil, &c., of the
people, or party; syn. أَقْبَحُهُمْ: and هِىَ السُّوْءَى
She is the most evil, &c. (Msb.) And the
[common] people say أَسْوَأُ الأَحْوَالِ, meaning The
[worst, or] most scanty, and weakest, of states or
conditions. (Msb.)
-A2-  [Also,] applied as an epithet to a man, (El-Umawee, M, TA,) Evil, bad,
abominable, foul, unseemly, unsightly, or ugly: (ElUmawee, M, K, TA:) fem. ↓ سَوْآءُ, (El-Umawee,
M, K,) which is thus applied to a woman; (ElUmawee, S, M;) or this is an instance of the
measure فَععلَآءُ having no [masc. of the measure]
أَفَعَلُ. (M, TA.) See also سَوْءَةٌ, in four places. It
is said in a trad. (M, TA) of the Prophet, or of
'Omar, (TA,) وَلُودٌ خَيْرٌ مِنْ حَسْنَآءَ عَقِيمٍ ↓ سَوْآءُ
[An ugly prolific woman is better than a beautiful
barren one]. (M, TA.)
مَسَآءَةٌ an inf. n. of سَآءَهُ: (S, M, K:) and [also a
subst. signifying An evil, as being] a cause of
grief or vexation; contr. of مَسَرَّةٌ: originally
مَسْوَأَةٌ: and therefore the pl. is ↓ مَسَاوٍ, for مَسَاوِئُ;
(Msb;) signifying also vices, faults, defects, or
imperfections; (S, Msb, K, TA;) and diseases;
(S, TA;) and acts of disobedience: (Msb:) so in
the saying, بَدَتْ مَسَاوِيهِ His acts of disobedience,
and vices, faults, &c., appeared: (Msb:) and
الخَيْلُ تَجْرِى عَلَى مَسَاوِيهَا Horses run, notwithstanding their vices, or faults, &c., (S, Meyd, K,)
and diseases; (S, Meyd;) for their generousness
impels them to do so: (S, Meyd, K: but omitted
in the CK:) and in like manner, the ingenuous
generous man bears difficulties, and defends, or
protects, what he is bound to defend or protect,
or to regard as sacred, or inviolable, though he
be weak, and practises generosity in all circumstances: (Meyd, TA:) or it is applied in relation
to the protection and defence of what should be
sacred, or inviolable, or of wives, or women under
covert, and the members of one's household, notwithstanding harm, or injury, and fear: or it
means that one may seek to defend himself by
means of a man though there be in him qualities
disapproved: (MF, TA:) but accord. to Lh,
المَسَاوِى has no proper sing., like المَحَاسِنُ:
(Meyd, TA: *) accord. to some of the writers on
inflection, it is the contr. of المَحَاسِنُ, and an
anomalous pl. of السُّوْءُ, being originally with ء.
(TA.)
مَسَاوٍ: see the next preceding paragraph.
