Msb, K:) and a mountain: (S, M, K: [in the last

what is behind it: whence goats are said to be
سَدٌّ يُرَى مِنْ وَرَائِهِ الفَقْرُ (assumed tropical:)  [a barrier behind which
is seen poverty]; meaning that they are not of
great utility: (M:) or سَدٌّ signifies what is made
by man; and سُدٌّ, what is created by God, (Zj,
M, Msb, K,) as a mountain: (Msb:) in the
Kur xviii. 92 and 93, and xxxvi. 8, some read
with fet-h, and some with damm: (M, TA:) the
pl. is أَسْدَادٌ, [a pl. of pauc.,] (A, Msb,) or أَسِدَّةٌ,
[also a pl. of pauc.,] and سُدُودٌ, [a pl. of mult.,]
the latter of these two agreeable with general
analogy, and the former of them anomalous, or,
[ISd says,] in my opinion, this (أَسِدَّةٌ) is pl. of
سِدَادٌ. (M.) You say, ضُرِبَ بَيْنَهُمَا سَدٌّ and سُدٌّ
[A barrier, or an obstacle, was set between them
two]: and ضُرِبَتْ بَيْنَهُمَا الأَسْدَادُ [Barriers, or
obstacles, were set between them two]. (A.) And
ضَرَبَتْ عَلَيْهِ الأَرْضُ بِالأَسْدَادِ (tropical:)  [The earth, or land,
set barriers, or obstacles, against him]; meaning,
the ways became closed, or stopped, against him,

obscure to him: (K: in the CK ضُرِبَتْ:) the
sing. of أَسْدَادٌ [accord. to general analogy] is
سُدٌّ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] the former (سَدٌّ) also
signifies, (Fr, S, M, L, K,) or ↓ سِدَادٌ, (A,) or the
former and ↓ سَدَادَةٌ, (L,) (tropical:)  A fault, or defect,
(Fr, S, M, A, &c.,) such as blindness and deafness
and dumbness, (S,) or such as closes, or stops,
one's mouth, so that he does not speak: (A:) pl.
of the first, (S, M, K,) or of the second, (A,)
أَسِدَّةٌ, [a pl. of pauc.,] (S, M, A, K,) accord. to
analogy سُدُودٌ, (S, M, K,) or أَسُدٌّ [which is a pl. of
pauc.]. (M.) You say, ↓ مَا بِهِ سِدَادٌ (tropical:)  There is
not in him any fault &c.: and فُلَانٌ بَرِىْءٌ مِنَ
الأَسِدَّةِ (tropical:)  Such a one is free from faults &c. (A.)
And تَسُدُّ فَاهُ عَنِ الكَلَامِ ↓ مَا بِفُلَانٍ سَدَادَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  There
is not in such a one a fault that stops his mouth
from speaking. (Aboo-Sa'eed, L.) And لَا تَجْعَلَنَّ

him, or shot at him, by his she-camel whereby he was
concealing himself]. (IAar, TA.) ―
-b5-  And سَدٌّ, (M,)
or سُدٌّ, (O, K,) is also syn. with ظِلٌّ [as meaning
(tropical:)  Shade, or shadow; or cover, or protection].
(IAar, M, O, K, TA.) A poet cited by IAar says,
قَعَدْتُ لَهُ فِى سَدِّ نِقْضٍ مُعَوَّدٍ
لِذٰلِكَ فِى صَحْرَآءَ جِذْمٍ دَرِينُهَا
(tropical:)  [I sat for him, i. e. lay in wait for him, in the
shade, or cover, of a camel rendered lean by travel,
accustomed to that, in a desert whereof the dry
herbage was old]: i. e. I made him a cover, or
screen, to me, in order that he might not see me:
and by جِذْم he means “ old,” because الجِذْمُ
signifies الأَصْلُ, and there is nothing older than
the أَصْل; and he uses it as an epithet because it
implies the meaning of an epithet. (M.)
-A2-  سَدٌّ
also signifies A thing, (S, K,) [i. e.] a [basket such
as is called] سَلَّة, (M, TA,) made of twigs, (S,
M, K,) and having covers (أَطْبَاق): (S, K: [but
this addition in the S and K seems properly to
apply to the pl., as will be shown by what
follows:]) pl. سِدَادٌ and سُدُودٌ: (M, TA:) or,
accord. to Lth, سُدُودٌ signifies [baskets such as are
called] سِلَال, [pl. of سَلَّةٌ,] made of twigs, and
having covers (أَطْبَاق); one of which is called [not
سَدٌّ but] ↓ سَدَّةٌ: and it is said also on other authority that the سَلَّة is called سَدَّةٌ and طَبْلٌ.

سُدٌّ (tropical:)  locusts (S, M, A, K) that have obstructed,
(S, K,) or obstructing, (M, A,) the horizon, (S,
M, A, K,) by their multitude: (S, A, K:) in
which case, سُدٌّ is either a substitute for جَرَادٌ and
therefore a substantive, or it is pl. of ↓ سَدُودٌ signifying that which obstructs the horizon and
therefore an epithet. (M.) ―
-b3-  And (tropical:)  A black
cloud, (AZ, S, K, TA,) that has risen in any
tract of the sky: (TA:) or a collection of clouds
rising, obstructing the horizon: (M:) pl. سُدُودٌ:

mountain. (M and L in art. صد.) ―

Also [A vestibule, or porch, for shade and shelter,
before the door of a house: this is a common
signification of the word, and is app. what is
meant by its being said that] the سُدَّة is what is

say, a سَقِيفَة [i. e. roof, or covering, such as projects over the door of a house &c.; or a place
roofed over]; (M:) or a ظُلَّة [i. e. roof, or cover-
ing, for shade and shelter,] over a door: (Mgh:)

before a بَيْت [or house, or perhaps here meaning
tent]: and a ظُلَّة at the door of a house (دَار):
(AA, TA:) or, accord. to Aboo-Sa'eed, (TA,)
in the language of the Arabs [of the desert] it
signifies [a space such as is termed] a فِنَآء pertaining to a tent of hair-cloth and the like; and
those who make it to be like a صُفَّة, or like a
سَقِيفَة, explain the word accord. to the way in
which it is used by the people of the towns and
villages: (Msb, TA:) or it signifies the door
[itself]: (S, A, Mgh, K:) or it has this meaning
also: (Msb:) some thus apply it to the door
itself: (A'Obeyd, L:) and the surrounding portico [of the interior court] of the largest, or
larger, mosque: (M, TA:) pl. سُدَدٌ. (S, L, Msb,
K.) You say, رَأَيْتُهُ قَاعِدًا بِسُدَّةِ بَابِهِ [I saw him
sitting in the vestibule of his door]: (S, TA:)
and بِسُدَّةِ دَارِهِ [in the vestibule before the door,
or at the door, of his house]. (TA.) Abu-d-Dardà
said, مَنْ يَغْشَ سُدَدَ السُّلْطَانِ يَقُمْ وَيَقْعُدْ, (S, L,)
or مَنْ يَأْتِ الخ, i. e. [He who comes to the vestibules, or gates, of the Sultán] experiences returns
of recent and old griefs, disquieting him so that
he is not able to remain at rest, but stands up and
sits down: (Mgh in art. قدم:) this he said when
he came to the gate of Mo'áwiyeh and did not
receive permission to enter. (L.) And it is said
in a trad., الشُّعْثُ الرُّؤُوسِ الَّذِينَ لَا تُفْتَحُ لَهُمُ السُّدَدُ,
(S, A,) meaning الأَبْوَابُ [i. e. The shaggy, or dishevelled, and dusty, in the heads are those to

―
-b2-  and see also سَدِيدٌ.
سَدَادٌ [an inf. n. of the intrans. verb سَدَّ; as also
↓ سَدَدٌ]. [Hence,] one says, إِنَّهُ لَذُو سَدَادٍ Verily

object or aim, in speaking, and in the managing
or disposing of affairs, and in shooting. (TA.)
―

speech [or action]. (S.) And هُوَ عَلَى سَدَادٍ مِنْ
أَمْرِهِ and ↓ سَدَدٍ [He is following a right course

أَمْرُ فُلَانٍ يَجْرِى عَلَى السَّدَادِ The affair of such
a one goes on according to that which is right.
(S.) ―
-b3-  [And hence the saying,] أَتَتْنَا رِيحٌ مِنْ
سَدَادِ أَرْضِهِمْ (tropical:)  A wind came to us from the direction of their land. (A, TA.) ―
-b4-  It is also used as
an epithet, syn. with سَدِيدٌ, q. v. (L.) ―
-b5-  And
السَّدَادُ [as though meaning The right projecter]
is a name that was given to a bow belonging to
the Prophet, as ominating the hitting of the object
aimed at by that which was shot from it. (TA.)

hostile country. (S, K, * TA.) ―
-b2-  سِدَادٌ مِنْ عَوَزٍ
and ↓ سَدَادٌ, (ISk, S, M, Msb, K,) but the former
is the more chaste, (S,) and it alone is mentioned
by most authors in this saying, because it is from
سداد as meaning the “ stopper ” of a bottle;
(Msb;) and some say that ↓ سَداد, with fet-h, is
a corruption; (Msb, K;) expressly disallowed by
As and ISh; (Msb;) a prov.; (Meyd;) meaning (tropical:)  A thing by which want is supplied, (S, M,
Msb, K,) and by which life is preserved; accord.
to ISh, if incomplete; and accord. to As, a thing
