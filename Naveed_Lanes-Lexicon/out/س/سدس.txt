-b3-  اسدس الرَّجُلُ The man was, or became, one
whose camels came to water on the sixth day,
counting the day of the next preceding drinking
as the first. (S, * K, * TA.) [See سِدْسٌ.]
سُدْسٌ: see سُدُسٌ.
سِدْسٌ is the original form of سِتٌّ, (M, K,)
fem. of سِتَّةٌ, which is originally سِدْسَةٌ, (M,)
[meaning Six; for] the dim. [of سِتٌّ is ↓ سُدَيْسٌ,
and that] of سِتَّةٌ is ↓ سُدَيْسَةٌ; and the pl.
is أَسْدَاسٌ. (S in art. ست, q. v.) ―
-b2-  Also [The
drinking of camels on the sixth day, counting the
day of the next preceding drinking as the first;
as will be seen from what here follows;] the
period of the drinking of camels [next] after that
called خِمْسٌ: or after six days and five nights:
(M, TA:) or their being kept from the water five
days, and coming to it on the sixth: (S:) but
Sgh says that this is a mistake, and that the
correct meaning of the term is, their being kept
from the water four days, and coming to it on the
fifth; and so it is explained in the [A and] K:
(TA:) or their drinking one day, then being kept
from the water four days, then coming to it on
the fifth day; so [by the application of the term
سِدْسٌ] they include in their reckoning the first
day in which the camels drink: (Aboo-Sahl,
TA:) or their remaining in the place of pasture
four days [after drinking], then coming to the
water on the fifth: (TA:) pl. أَسْدَاسٌ. (M, Sgh,
TA.) You say, وَرَدَتْ إِبْلُهُ سِدْسًا [His camels
came to the water on the sixth day, counting the
day of the next preceding drinking as the first].
(S, A, K.) [Hence the saying,] ضَرَبَ أَخْمَاسًا
لِأَسْدَاسٍ [which see expl. voce خِمْسٌ]. (A.) ―
-b3-
Also The sixth young one, or offspring. (A in

سَدَسٌ: see سَدِيسٌ, in three places: ―
-b2-  and, as
an epithet applied to a calf, see عَضْبٌ.
سُدُسٌ (S, M, A, Msb, K) and ↓ سُدْسٌ (S, Msb,
K) A sixth part; (S, M, A, Msb, K;) as also
↓ سَدِيسٌ, (S, Msb, K,) a form used by some, like
as one says عُشْرٌ and عَشِيرٌ: (S:) pl. أَسْدَاسٌ. (M,
Msb, TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence, app., the saying, ضَرَبَ
أَخْمَاسَهُ فِى أَسْدَاسِهِ, which see expl. voce خُمُسٌ.]
[
سُدَاسَ as meaning Six and six together, or six
at a time and six at a time, seems not to have
been heard: see عُشَارَ. But Freytag mentions
سُدَاسٌ as used by El-Mutanebbee for سِتَّة.]

بَازِل; (S, K;) after that called the رَبَاعِيَة; (M,
L, TA;) as also ↓ سَدِسٌ; (S, K;) masc. and fem.,
because the fem. names of teeth are all with ة,

(of the former, S,) is سُدُسٌ and (of the latter, S)
سُدْسٌ. (S, K.) You say, of a camel, أَلْقَى سَدِيسَهُ
and ↓ سَدَسَهُ [He cast his tooth called the سديس
and سدس]. (A.) ―
-b2-  And hence, (Mgh,) A
camel, (M, A, Mgh, Msb,) and a sheep or goat,
(M, TA,) casting his سَدِيس, (M, A, TA,) or his
tooth that is after the رَبَاعِيَة; (Msb;) i. e., in the

sheep or goat six years old: (S, K:) pl. سُدُسٌ.

eight-year-old camels]. (S, TA.)
