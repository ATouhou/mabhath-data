سانههُ, inf. n. مُسَانَهَةٌ and سِنَاهٌ; and سَاناهُ,
inf. n. مُسَانَاةٌ; (K;) or عَامَلَهُ مُسُانَهَةً, and مُسَانَاةً;
(Msb;) He made an engagement, or a contract,
with him for work or the like, by the year: (K:)
and اِسْتَأْجَرْتُهُ مُسَانَهَةً, and مُسَانَاةً, [I hired him by
the year:] (S:) مُسَانَهَةٌ and مُسَانَاةٌ from السَّنَةُ are
like مُعَاوَمَةٌ from العَامُ, and مُشَاهَرَةٌ from الشَّهْرُ, and
مُرَابَعَةٌ from الرَّبِيعُ, &c. (TA in art. ربع.) ―
-b2-
سانهت النَّخْلَةُ The palm-tree bore one year and
not another; (As, K;) as also عَاوَمَت. (As, TA.)
4
أَسْنَهَ In this form of the verb, the final radical
letter is changed into ت, so that they say أَسْنَتُوا,
meaning They experienced drought, or barrenness. (TA. [See also art. سنت.])
5
تَسَنَّهْتُ عِنْدَهُ, (S,) and تَسَنَّيْتُ عنده, (S, Msb,)
I remained, stayed, dwelt, or abode, with him, or
at his abode, a year: (Msb:) both signify the
same. (TA.) [See also 5 in art. سنو and سنى.]
―
-b2-  تسنّهت النَّخْلَةُ (assumed tropical:)  The palm-tree underwent the
lapse of years; (S, Msb;) as also ↓ سَنِهَت: (S:)
and in like manner one says of other things.
(Msb.) ―
-b3-  تسنّه said of food and of beverage,
(Fr, S, TA,) (assumed tropical:)  It became altered [for the worse];
as also ↓ سَنِهَ, aor.
سَنَهَ, inf. n. سَنَهٌ: (TA:) or it
became altered [for the worse] by the lapse of
years: (Fr, S, TA:) and التَّسَنُّهُ in relation to
bread and beverage &c. means the becoming
mouldy, or musty, or spoiled. (S: and so in some
copies of the K and in the TA: in other copies of
the K, السَّنِهُ, like كَتِف, is put in the place of
التَّسَنُّهُ; and المُتَكَرِّجُ in the place of the explanation التَّكَرُّجُ.) فَانْظُرْ إِلَى طَعَامِكَ وَشَرَابِكَ لَمْ يَتَسَنَّهْ,
in the Kur [ii. 261], means (assumed tropical:)  [But look at thy
food and thy beverage,] it has not become altered
[for the worse] by the lapse of years: (Fr, S,
TA:) Az says that this is the right way of reading, by pronouncing the ه in يتسنّه in pausing
after it and in continuing without pausing: Ks
used to suppress the ه in the latter case and to
pronounce it in the former: and Aboo-'Amr EshSheybánee says that the original form [of يَتَسَنَّ]
is يَتَسَنَّنْ; the like change being made in it as is
made in تَظَنَّيْتُ [for تَظَنَّنْتُ] and in قَصَّيَتُ أَظْفَارِى
[for قَصَّصْتُ اظفارى]. (TA. [See also 5 in art.
سنو and سنى, last sentence.])
سَنَةٌ a word of which the final radical letter is
rejected, (S, Msb,) and of which there are two dial.
vars., (Msb,) being, accord. to some, originally
سَنْهَةٌ, (S, Msb,) like جَبْهَةٌ (S) or سَجْدَةٌ, (Msb,) and
accord to others, سَنْوةٌ, (S, * Msb,) like شَهْوَةٌ, and
upon each of these originals are founded modifications of the word, (Msb,) therefore it is mentioned in the K [and S and other lexicons] in the
present art. and again in art. سنو, (TA,) A year;
syn. حَوْلٌ; (Msb;) or عَامٌ: (M, K:) or, as Suh
says, in the R, the سَنَة is longer than the عَام; the
latter word being applied to the [twelve] Arabian
months [collectively], and thus differing from the
former word: (TA:) with the Arabs it consists
of four seasons, mentioned before [in art. زمن,
voce زَمَنٌ]: but sometimes it is tropically applied
to (tropical:)  a single فَصْل [or quarter]; as in the saying,
دَامَ المَطَرُ السَّنَةَ كُلَّهَا, meaning [The rain continued] during the فَصْل [or quarter, all of it]:
(Msb:) [see more in art. سنو and سنى:] the dim.
is ↓ سُنَيْهَةُ (S, Msb) accord. to those who make
the original of سَنَةٌ to be سَنْهَةٌ, (Msb,) and ↓ سُنَيَّةٌ
(S, Msb) accord. to those who make the original
of سَنَةٌ to be سَنْوَةٌ; (Msb;) and some say سُنَيْنَةٌ,
but this is rare: (TA:) the pl. is سَنَهَاتٌ (Msb, K)
accord. to those who make the original of سَنَةٌ to
be سَنْهةٌ, (Msb,) and سَنَوَاتٌ (Msb, K) accord. to
those who make the original of سَنَةٌ to be سَنْوَةٌ;
(Msb;) and سِنُونَ also, (S, Msb, K,) like the
masc. perfect pl., (Msb,) [agreeably with a rule
applying to other cases of this kind,] with kesr,
to the س, (S, TA,) and سِنِينَ [in the accus. and
gen. cases], (Msb, TA,) so that one says, هٰذِهِ
سِنُونَ [These are years], and رَأَيْتُ سِنِينَ [I saw
years], (TA,) and the ن is elided when it is prefixed to another noun, governing the latter in the
gen. case, (Msb,) and some say سُنُونَ, with damm
to the س; (S, TA;) and in one dial., the ى is
retained in all the cases, and the ن is made a
letter of declinability, with tenween when the
word is indeterminate, [so that one says سِنِينٌ,]
and is not elided when the word is prefixed to
another noun, governing the latter in the gen.
case, because it is [regarded as] one of the radical
letters of the word; and of this dial. is the saying
of the Prophet, اَللّٰهُمَّ اجْعَلْهَا عَلَيْهِمْ سِنِينًا كَسِنِينِ
يُوسُفَ [O God, make them to be to them years
like the years of Joseph]; (Msb; [but in my
copy of the Mgh, I find كَسِنِى يُوسُفَ;]) or with
respect to سِنِينٌ, like مِئِينٌ, with refa [and tenween], there are two opinions; one is, that it is
of the measure فِعْلِينٌ, like غِسْلِينٌ, with a rejection [of one letter], though this is an anomalous
pl., for there sometimes occurs among pls. that
which has no parallel, as عِدًى, and this is the opinion of Akh; the other is, that it is of the measure
فَعِيلٌ, changed to فِعِيلٌ because of the kesreh of
the second letter; the pl. being in some instances
of the measure فَعِيلٌ, like كَلِيبٌ and عَبِيدٌ; but
he who holds this opinion makes its final ن to be
a substitute for و, and that of مِائَةٌ a substitute
for ى: (S:) you may also suppress the tenween
in سِنِينٌ; [in which case it seems that one says
سِنِينَ in the nom. case (assimilating it to سِنُونَ)
as well as in the accus. and the gen.; like as one
does in the instances of بُرِين and بِرِين, pls. of
بُرَةٌ, accord. to the K, though, as I have shown
in art. برو, there is some doubt on this point;]
but the suppression of the tenween in سِنِينٌ is
more rare than its pronunciation: (I' Ak p. 18:)
and another pl. is سُنِىٌّ, [originally سُنُوٌّ,] of the
measure فُعُولٌ. (Er-Rághib, TA in art. سنو.) The
phrase ثَلٰثَ مِائَةٍ سِنِينَ, in the Kur [xviii. 24],
is said by Akh to be for ثَلٰثَمِائَةٍ مِنَ السِّنِينَ [Three
hundred of years]: and he says that if the سِنُون
be an explicative of the مِائَة, it is in the gen. case
[to agree with مِائَةٍ]; and if an explicative of the
ثَلٰث, it is in the accus. case [to agree with ثَلٰثَ].
(S. [See also Bd on this phrase; and see De
Sacy's Ar. Gr., 2nd ed., i. 423.]) [لِسَنَةٍ, relating
to an animal or a plant or the like, means To the
completion of a year: and لِسَنَتِهِ, to the completion of his, or its, year; i. e. in his, or its, first
year.] And one says, ↓ لَقِيتُهُ مُنْذُ سُنَيَّاتٍ [I met
him some years ago; three or more, to ten, years
ago]: a phrase like لَقِيتُهُ ذَاتَ العُوَيْمِ. (Az, TA in
art. عوم.) And ↓ سُنَيَّةٌ is a dim. of enhancement,
of سَنَةٌ: one says سُنَيَّةٌ حَمْرَآءُ A severe year of
drought or barrenness or dearth: (TA:) and
البِيضِ ↓ وَقَعُوا فِى السُّنَيَّاتِ [They lapsed into the
severe years of scantiness of herbage]: these were
years that pressed hard upon the people of ElMedeeneh. (K, TA.) ―
-b2-  سَنَةٌ [alone] also signifies (tropical:)  Drought, or barrenness: (Msb, K, TA:)
or vehement, or intense, drought: (TA in art.
سنو:) an instance of a noun used especially in
one of its senses, like دَابَّةٌ applied to “ a horse,”
and مَالٌ applied to “ camels: ” pl., in this, as in
the former, sense, سَنَهَاتٌ [and سَنَوَاتٌ] and سِنُونَ
and سِنِينٌ. (TA.) One says of a land (أَرْضٌ),
أَصَابَتْهَا السَّنَةُ (tropical:)  Drought, or barrenness, befell it.
(Msb.) And in like manner one says of people,
أَصَابَتْهُمُ السَّنَهُ (tropical:)  [Drought, &c., befell them]. (TA.)
A seeker of herbage and of a place in which to
alight was sent to a tract, and found it dried up
by want of rain, and when he returned, being
asked respecting it, he said, السَّنَةُ, meaning
(tropical:)  Drought, &c. [has befallen it]. (TA.) And it
is said in a trad., اَللّٰهُمَّ أَعِنِّى عَلَى مُضَرَبِالسَّنَةِ, i. e.
(tropical:)  [O God, aid me against Mudar] by drought &c.
(TA.)
-A2-  It is also [used as an epithet,] applied
to land (أَرْضٌ), as meaning (tropical:)  Affected with
drought, or barrenness; (As, S, K;) as also
↓ سَنْهَآءُ and سَنْوَآءُ. (Msb.) One says likewise,
هٰذِهِ بِلَادٌ سِنِينٌ (tropical:)  These are countries, or tracts,
affected with drought &c.: and Et-Tirimmáh
says
بِمُنْخَرَقٍ تَحِنُّ الرِّيحُ فِيهِ
حَنِينَ الحُلْبِ فِى البَلَدِ السِّنِينِ
(tropical:)  [In a gusty tract, the wind moaning therein
like the moaning of the milch ewes or goats (see
حَلُوبٌ) in the country affected with drought, or
the countries, &c., بَلَد being regarded as a coll.
gen. n. and therefore qualified by a pl., like قَوْمٌ
in the phrase قَوْمٌ كَافِرُونَ]. (TA.)
سَنَهْ سَنَهْ, also pronounced with teshdeed to the
ن: see سَنًا, in art. سنو and سنى, last sentence.

↓ مَسْنُوَّةٌ and ↓ مَسْنِيَّةٌ, (S, M, K,) meaning Watered,
or irrigated, land: (M:) the و in مَسْنِيَّةٌ being
changed into ى, (S, M,) in the opinion of Sb,
(M,) like as it is in قِنْيَةٌ; (S;) for he knew not
سَنَيْتُهَا [as meaning I watered it], holding مَسْنِيَّةٌ

camel,] was used for the drawing of water upon
it [to irrigate land: see سَانِيَةٌ, below]. (M, K.)

أَسْنَتُوا signifies They were afflicted with drought,
or barrenness: (S, M, * K: [Freytag has erroneously assigned this signification to اِسْتَنَوْا:]) the
و, (S,) or the ى, which is originally و, (M,)
being changed into ت, (S, M,) to distinguish
between this verb and اسنى in the sense expl.
above. (S. [See art. سنت.])
5
تسنّى: see 2, in two places. ―
-b2-  Also i. q.
رقى رقية [in the CK رَقٰى رُقْيَةً, and in my MS.
copy of the K رَقَا رُقْيَةً, but correctly رَقِىَ, meaning

inf. n. is expl. in the TK as meaning يوكسكه
چقمق:] said of a man. (K, * TA.)

تَرَضَّى: so in the phrase تسنّى فُلَانًا [He sought
to please, content, or satisfy, such a one; or he
pleased, contented, or satisfied, such a one, after
striving, labouring, or toiling]: (K:) but it is
said in the M, [app. a mistake, perhaps for the T,
for in the M I do not find it,] that سنيت فلانا
[by which may be meant either ↓ سَنَيْتُ or ↓ سَنَّيْتُ]
means ترضّيته. (TA.)
-A4-  تَسَنَّيْتُ عِنْدَهُ I remained,
stayed, dwelt, or abode, with him, or at his abode,
a year; like تَسَنَّهْتُ عِنْدَهُ: (Msb in art. سنه:)
or it means ↓ أَقَمْتُ عِنْدَهُ سُنَيَّاتِ [I remained &c.,
with him, or at his abode, some years; three or
more, to ten, years]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Hence, (TA,)
تسنّى signifies also It became altered [for the
worse], (S, K, TA,) accord. to Er-Rághib, so that
it lost its freshness, by the lapse of years: (TA:
[see also تَسَنَّهَ:]) but accord. to AA, it is from
the phrase in the Kur [xv. 26 and 28 and 33]
مِنْ حَمَأٍ مَسْنُونٍ; one of the نs being changed
into ى; and is similar to تَقَضَّى for تَقَضَّضَ. (S,
TA.)

or extremity, of the light of lightning: (T, TA:)
or light shining or gleaming, or diffusing itself
and rising: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or a high light:
and applied also to the shining, or gleaming, of
weapons: (Ham p. 271:) MF says that the apparent particularization in the K [&c.] seems to
have been taken from the verse of the Kur
[xxiv. 43], and that the word is correctly a
general term, meaning as expl. in the Msb:
(TA:) [it is originally سَنَوٌ, though mentioned in
the K as belonging to art. سنى; for] the dual is
سَنَوَانِ: As knew not a verb belonging to it.
(TA.)

AHn describes it as a shrub, or small tree, of the
[class called] أَغْلَاث [pl. of غَلَثٌ], which is mixed
with حِنَّآء, and improves and strengthens its
colour, and blackens it; and which has a fruit
of such kind that, when it dries up, and is put in
motion by the wind, it causes to be heard a sound
such as is termed زَجَل [q. v.]: (M in arts. سنو
and سنى, and TA:) its name is as above and
↓ سَنَآءٌ: (M, K:) and the n. un. is سَنَاةٌ and سَنَآءَةٌ:
(M in arts. سنو and سنى:) the dual of سَنًا is
سَنَيَانِ, and some say سَنَوَانِ. (M in art. سنى.)
[Accord. to a gloss. in a copy of the S, as stated
by Golius, the dual سَنَوَانِ is applied to The leaves
of cyprus (or حِنَّآء) and senna mixed together,
with which the hair is dyed black.] In the phrase
سَنَا المِسْكِ, in a verse of El-Jaadee, the plant
[above mentioned] may be meant, as though it
were mixed with musk: or it may be from سَنًا
signifying “ light; ” because the diffusion of odour
is like that of light. (M.)
-A3-  سَنَا, (JM,) or سَنَا
سَنَا, (TA,) without teshdeed, and also with tesh-deed, to the ن, is an Abyssinian expression,
meaning حَسُنَ [q. v.], (JM, TA,) occurring in a
trad. of Umm-Khálid; but it is differently related;
some saying سَنَهْ سَنَهْ; and some, سَنَان; and pronouncing each with, as well as without, teshdeed:
so in the Nh. (TA.)
طَعَامٌ سَنٍ [Food, or wheat,] that has undergone the lapse of years; as also سَنِهٌ. (AZ, TA
in art. سنه.)
سَنَةٌ, applied to a portion of time, (M,) signifying A year, syn. حَوْلٌ, (Mgh,) or عَامٌ, (K,) but
a distinction is made between عَامٌ and سَنَةٌ, [as
has been stated in art. سنه,] (TA,) belongs to
arts. سنو and سنه [in both of which it is mentioned in many of the lexicons: see what has been
said respecting it in art. سنه in the present work]:
(M:) accord. to Suh, in the R, it is from سَنَا,
aor. يَسْنُو, said of a beast [turning a water-wheel],
meaning “ he turned round about the well; ” so
that it signifies a single revolution of the sun;
and it is sometimes termed دَارٌ: he says also that
it is longer than the عَام, which is applied to the
[twelve] Arabian months [collectively]: but سَنَةٌ
is also applied to twelve revolutions of the moon:
the سَنَة شَمْسِيَّة [or solar year] is three hundred
and sixty-five days and a quarter of a day: and
the سَنَة قَمَرِيَّة [or lunar year] is three hundred
and fifty-four days and a third of a day: it is
also said, on the authority of Er-Rághib, that
سَنَةٌ is used as denoting a year in which is difficulty, and drought, or barrenness, or dearth; and
عَامٌ, as denoting that in which is ampleness of the
means, or circumstances, of life, and abundance
of herbage or the like; and by this is explained
the nice point in the words of the Kur [xxix. 13],
أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ إِلَّا خَمْسِينَ عَامًا [a thousand years save
fifty years]; because the fifty years passed before
the mission of the prophet [Noah], before which
no harm happened to him from his people; but
after his mission, the years were difficult to him.
(TA.) [Respecting the dims., (which are سُنّيَّةٌ
and سُنَيْهَةٌ, the former accord. to those who make
the original of سَنَةٌ to be سَنْوَةٌ, and the latter
accord. to those who make it to be سَنْهَةٌ,) and the
pls., (which are سَنَوَاتٌ and سَنَهَاتٌ and سِنُونَ and
سُنُونَ and سِنِينٌ and سِنِينَ, the last whereof is
originally سِنِينٌ, and سُنِىٌّ also,) see سَنَةٌ in art.
