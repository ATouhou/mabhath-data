سير1
سَارَ, aor. يَسِيرُ, inf. n. سَيْرٌ and مَسِيرٌ, (S, M,
A, Mgh, Msb, K,) which latter is extr., for by
rule it should be of the measure مَفْعَلٌ, with fet-h
[to the ع], (S,) and مَسِيرَةٌ (M, K) and سَيْرُورَةٌ
(M, Mgh, K) like قَيْلُولَةٌ, but [Mtr says] we have
not heard it, (Mgh,) and تَسْيَارٌ, (S, M, K,) which
last denotes repetition or frequency of the action,
(M,) He, or it, went [in any manner, or any
pace]; went, or passed, along; marched, journeyed, or proceeded; went away, passed away, or
departed; (M, * K, * TA;) by night and by day.
(Msb, TA.) You say, سَارَتِ الدَّابَّةُ [The beast
went, went along, &c.]. (S.) [And سار سَيْرًا شَدِيدًا

vehement pace, or vehemently. And سار العَنَقَ

from thy place; pass thou from it: (L in art.
نفذ:) or (assumed tropical:)  feign thou heedlessness, and bear, or
endure, or be forbearing; an elliptical phrase;
as though it were originally سِرْ وَدَعْ عَنْكَ المِرَآءَ
وَالشَّكَّ [go thou, and leave wrangling and doubt].
(S.) ―
-b2-  [Hence, سارت السَّفِينَةُ (tropical:)  The ship went, or

obtain, or became usual, among people. (S, M, *
TA.) The Hudhalee (Khálid Ibn-Zuheyr, M)
says,
فَلَا تَجْزَعَنْ مِنْ سُنَّةٍ أَنْتَ سِرْتَهَا
فَأَوَّلُ رَاضٍ سُنَّةً مَنْ يَسِيرُهَا
[Then by no means be thou impatient of a way
of acting which thou hast made usual; for the
first who should be content with a way of acting
is he who makes it usual]. (S, M, L, TA: but
in the M and TA, in the place of تجزعن, we find
تَغْضَبَنْ.)

thong: ” it is asserted by certain of the later
writers that it is a subst., not an epithet; and he
who says so cites Sb as asserting that a word of
the measure فِعَلَآءُ is not an epithet, but is a subst.:

مَسُورٌ بِهِ [A man made to go, or journey, &c.]:
(IJ, M, K:) accord. to Kh, in this case, and in
others like it, the ى is changed into و [so that
مَسْيُورٌ, the original form of مَسِيرٌ and of مَسُورٌ,
becomes مَسْوُورٌ, and is then contracted into مَسُورٌ]:
(M:) or, accord. to Kh, the ى is rejected: but
accord. to Akh, it is the و that is rejected [so
that مَسْيُورٌ becomes مَسْيُرٌ; and then, مَسُيْرٌ; and
