سَقُرَ, inf. n. سَقْرٌ, (TA,)
The sun scorched, or burned, him, altering the
colour of his complexion and shin, (S, * TA,) and
pained him, or pained his brain by its heat:
(TA:) melted and heated him, or it. (TA.) And

سَقَرُ Hell: (S, K:) one of the [proper] names
thereof: (S:) Aboo-Bekr says, There are two
opinions respecting this word: some say, that
the fire of the world to come is thus called,
and that the derivation of the word is unknown,
and that it is imperfectly decl. because it is determinate and a foreign word: others say that it
is from سَقَرَتْهُ الضْلَرRَّمْسُ, because it melts the bodies
and souls, and that it is an Arabic word; and he
who holds it to be such says that it is imperfectly
decl. because it is determinate and of the fem.
gender. (TA.)
سَقَرَاتٌ The vehemence of the stroke of the
sun. (S.)
مُسْمَقِرُّ A day vehemently hot. (S in this art.,
and K in art. سمقر.) This is its proper place.
(TA.)
