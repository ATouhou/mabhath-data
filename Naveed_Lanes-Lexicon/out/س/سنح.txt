the spectator; thus expl. by Ru-beh to Yoo,
in the presence of AO; i. e. passing from the
direction of the left hand of the spectator
towards the direction of his right hand: (S:) or
coming from the direction of the right side of the
spectator (Aboo-'Amr Esh-Sheybánee, IF, A, L,
Msb) towards the direction of his left hand;
turning towards him its left side, which is that
termed الإِنْسِىُّ: contr. of بَارِحٌ [q. v.]: (Aboo-
'Amr Esh-Sheybánee, L:) the pl. [of the former]
is سَوَانِحُ and سَانِحَاتٌ and [of either] سُنُحٌ: and
this last is also employed to signify auspicious
and inauspicious gazelles [&c.], accord. to the
different opinions of the Arabs. (L.) The Arabs
[who apply the epithet in the latter of the two
senses first explained] regard the سَانِح as a good
omen, and the بَارِح as an evil omen; (Aboo-'Amr
Esh-Sheybánee, S, L;) because one cannot shoot
at the latter without turning himself: (S in art.
برح:) but some of them hold the reverse of this:
(Aboo-'Amr Esh-Sheybánee, L:) the people of
Nejd hold the سانح to be a good omen; but
sometimes a Nejdee adopts the [contr.] opinion
of the Hijázee. (IB, TA,) It is said in a prov.,
مَنْ لِى بِالسَّانِحِ بَعْدَ البَارِحِ [expl. in art. برح].
(S, K.) ―
-b2-  [It is said in Har p. 671 that السَّانِحُ
also signifies المتطيّر المتفاّل, as though
meaning The person auguring, or who augurs,
evil or good, from birds: but I think that the
right reading is المُتَطَيَّرُ بِهِ وَالمُتَفَأَّلُ بِهِ مِنَ الطُّيُورِ,
i. e. what is regarded as an evil omen and as a
good omen, of birds.]
