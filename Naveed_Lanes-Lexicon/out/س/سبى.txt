سَبْىٌ i. q. ↓ مَسْبِىٌّ [i. e. Made captive]; (M;)
or السَّبْىُ signifies مَا يُسْبَى [i.e. what is made
captive; but I rather think that the right explanation is مَنْ يُسْبَى i. e the person who is made
captive; agreeably with what follows]: pl. سُبِىٌّ:
(M, K:) one says قَوْمٌ سَبْىٌ [a company, or party,
of men made captive]; the latter word in this
case being an inf. n. used as an epithet; [therefore, as such, it is applicable to a single person,
male or female, as well as to a pl. number;] and
accord. to As, one says not otherwise than thus
in speaking of a company, or party, of men:
(Msb, TA:) [but] ↓ سَبِىٌّ is [also] applied to a
single person, to the male and the female, (M, K,)
i. e. to the latter, as to the former, without ة, (M,)
as meaning made captive: (K:) or سَبِىٌّ is applied to a boy, or young man, or male slave, as
also ↓ مَسْبِىٌّ; and سَبِيَّةٌ to a girl, or young woman,
or female slave, as also ↓ مَسْبِيَّةٌ; (Msb;) or to a
woman, in this sense: (S:) and the pl. of ↓ سَبِىٌّ,
(M, K,) or of سَبِيَّةٌ, (Msb,) is سَبَايَا, (M, Msb, K,)
applied to women. (M.) ―

سَبًا: see سَبِىٌّ.
-A2-  Also A tribe of El-Yemen; regarded as a حَىّ, perfectly decl.; and regarded as a

said in the Msb, it is the name of a town, or province,
in El-Yemen; masc., and therefore perfectly decl.;
and fem., and therefore imperfectly decl.; called
by the name of its builder: (TA:) [hence,] one
says, ذَهَبُوا أَيْدِى سَبَا and أَيَادِى سَبَا, [making the
last word to be without tenween either as a fem.
proper name or because of pausing after it,] i. e.
They went away scattered, or dispersed: (S, M,
K:) J says, (TA,) they are two nouns made one,
like مَعْدِى كَرِبَ, perfectly decl. because not occurring otherwise than as a denotative of state,
[and therefore indeterminate,] whether you make
the former to be a prefixed noun governing the
latter in the gen. case, or do not so. (S, TA.
[See also art. سبأ.])
