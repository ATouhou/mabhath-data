the fire, which was likened to the gleaming of
lightning. (TA.) [See also سَلَعٌ, where a meaning somewhat different from those above is indicated.])

سِلْعٌ A cleft, or fissure, in a mountain, (Lh,
IAar, Yaakoob, S, K,) having the form of a

-A2-  A certain
kind of bitter tree; (S, K;) which, in the Time

drought, or barrenness of the earth, to hang
somewhat of this tree and of the عُشَر to the tails
ذُنَابَى [a sing. used as a pl.]) of [wild] bulls or
cows, then to kindle fire therein, and make them
to ascend upon the mountain; and thus, they
assert, they used to obtain rain: (S, TA:) the
author of the K says that J has made a mistake
in saying ذنابى, in the above-cited passage; that
he should have said أَذْنَاب; but others had made
this remark before the author of the K; and
'Abd-El-Kádir Ibn-'Omar El-Baghdádee says
that the mistake is to be imputed to these, and
not to J, who has only used a sing. in the sense
of a pl., like as الدُّبُرَ is used in the Kur [liv. 45],
for الأَدْبَارَ: (MF, TA:) AHn cites an Arab of
the desert, of the سَرَاة, as saying that the سلع
grows near to a tree, and then clings to it, and
climbs it, with long, green, leafless shoots, twining upon the branches and interweaving themselves, and having a fruit like bunches of grapes,
which is small, and, when ripe, becomes black,
and is eaten only by the monkeys, or apes, not by
men, nor by the beasts that are left to pasture at
their pleasure; and adding, I have not tasted it,
but I think that it is bitter; and when it is
broken, there flows from it a viscous fluid, clear,
and having strings: such is the description of the
man of the سراة: (TA:) or it is a certain
poisonous plant, (K, TA,) not to be tasted, like
زَرْع [here meaning wheat or barley] when it first
comes forth, scantily scattered in the ground, and
having a small, yellow, prickly leaf, its prickles
being downy; it is a herb, or leguminous plant,
which spreads itself upon the surface of the
ground, like [the plant called] رَاحَةُ الكَلْبِ, having
no root, and it is not improbable that the ostrich
may feed upon it, notwithstanding its bitterness,
for it sometimes feeds upon the colocynth: (Aboo-Ziyád, TA:) or it is a species of aloes: (K:) or
a herb, or leguminous plant, (K, TA,) of those
termed ذُكُور [that are hard and thick, or thick,
and inclining to bitterness, or thick and rough],
(TA,) of bad, or nauseous, or disgusting, taste:
(K, TA:) so says Aboo-Nasr: (TA:) [Forskål
found this name applied in El-Yemen to the
sælanthus quadragonus: (Flora Ægypt. Arab.,
pp. cv. and 33:) and the cacalia sonchifolia:
(Ibid., p. cxix.:) and the name of سَع أَبْيَض, or
سَلَع البَقَر, to the senecio hadiensis. (Ibid.,

غُدَّة, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) that moves about when

say that it is a thick tumour, not adhering to the

for سَلِيقَةٌ.]
