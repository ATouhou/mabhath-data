and in rugged ground, but not in sand nor upon
a mountain; and have a yellow fruit: (TA:)
n. un. with ة: and it is said to be the same as

thorns: (K:) n. un. in this sense with ة: (Fr,
Ham p. 603, TA:) or any tall trees: (K:) or

صَيْف [or summer]: (Ham ubi suprà:) accord. to
AHn, the سَرْحَة is a great tree with spreading
branches, beneath which people often alight,
widely extending; men alight beneath it in the
صَيْف [or summer], and pitch tents, or build

to information given to Az by an Arab of the
desert not known by him to have uttered a lie,
it has a dusty colour, is not so tall as the أَثْل [a
species of tamarisk], has small leaves, and lank
branches, or twigs, and always grows slanting,
its inclination among all the trees being towards
the south (اليَمِين): Lth says that the سَرْح are a
kind of trees that have a fruit, and they are the أَلَآء
(الالآء [app. a mistranscription for الآء, i. e. the
آء,]); but Az says that this is a mistake: Lth
cites the saying of' Antarah,
بَطَلٌ كَأَنَّ ثِيَابَهُ فِى سَرْحَةٍ
تُحْذَى نِعَالُ السِّبْتِ لَيْسَ بِتَوْءَمِ
(L,) i. e. He is a man of valour, tall of stature,
as though his clothes were upon a great tree such
as is called سرحة; sandals of سبت [q. v.] are cut
and made for him, such as are worn by the kings;
and he is not a twin; so that he has been well
suckled: (EM p. 245:) thus he describes this
person as tall of stature, showing that the سرحة
is a large tree: but the الآء [or آء] has no trunk
nor tallness: IAar says that the سَرْح are ذَكْوَان
that have become large; and the ذكوان are
certain trees having beautiful [shoots such as are
termed] عَسَالِيج: the pl. is سِرَاحٌ. (L.) ―
-b2-  The
n. un., سَرْحَةٌ, is applied to signify (tropical:)  A man's wife,
(S, A,) by a metonymy. (S.) The Arabs are said
by Az to term a woman, or wife, a سَرْحة growing
over water, because in this case it is in the most
beautiful condition. (TA.) ―
-b3-  [Accord. to Forskål,
(Flora Aegypt. Arab. pp. cvi. and 68,) the
name of سرح is applied to a plant of the class
pentandria, which he terms Cadaba farinosa,
(described by him in p. 68,) growing in the
lower region of the mountains of Wádee-Surdud,
in Tihámeh.]

(TA.) And نَاقَةٌ سُرُحٌ and ↓ مُنْسَرِحَةٌ A quick, or
swift, she-camel; (S;) as also ↓ سَرُوحٌ: (L:) or

Har p. 481.) And فَرَسٌ سُرُحٌ and ↓ مُنْسَرِحٌ (K)
and ↓ سِرْيَاحٌ, (TA,) or خَيْلٌ سُرُحٌ, (S,) A horse, or
horses, quick, or swift. (S, K.) [See also سَرَاحِ,
and سَرَّاحٌ.] And مِلَاطٌ سُرُحُ الجَنْبِ A shoulderblade, (TA,) or an upper arm-bone, of a camel,
(ISh, T, TA,) quick to go and come [or move
forwards and backwards]. (As, S, TA.) And
مِشْيَةٌ سُرُحٌ An easy gait, or manner of going;
(S, K;) like سُجُحٌ. (TA.) And عَطَآءٌ سُرُحٌ (assumed tropical:)  A
gift promptly given, without deferring: (K:) or
(tropical:)  a gift that is easy and quick; a metaphorical
phrase from نَاقَةٌ سُرُحٌ expl. above. (Har p. 481.)
-A2-  [See also سَرِيحَةٌ, of which, in two senses, it
is a pl.]

[q. v.]. (Fr, S, TA.)
-A2-  Also A she-ass that has
attained to maturity but has not become pregnant.
(O, K.)
-A3-  And سَرْحَةُ, (O,) or السَّرْحَةُ, (K,) is
the name of A certain dog. (O, K.)
سِرْحَانٌ, of the measure فِعْلَانٌ, the ن being an
augmentative letter, (Sb, S,) from the verb سَرَحَ,
(TA,) The wolf; (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K;) as also
سِرْحَالٌ; (Yaakoob, K;) fem. سِرْحَانَةٌ (Ks, S) and
سِرْحَالَهٌ; (TA;) and the lion, (S, O, Msb, K,) in
the dial. of Hudheyl: (S, O:) pl. سَرَاحِينُ (S, A,
O, Msb, K) and سَرَاحٍ and سِرَاحٌ, (O, L, K,) but
the last not remembered to have been heard by
Az. (L.) It is said in a prov.,
سَقَطَ العَشَآءُ بِهِ عَلَى سِرْحَانِ
[The evening-meal, or supper, (i. e. the seeking
for it,) made him to fall, or light, upon a wolf]:
(S, Meyd:) accord. to A'Obeyd, it originated
from a man's going forth to seek the eveningmeal, and falling upon a wolf, which devoured
him: accord. to As, from the like accident to a
beast: accord. to IAar, from a man's being slain
by another man, named سِرْحَان: it is applied to
the seeking an object of want that leads one to
destruction. (Meyd. [See Freytag's Arab. Prov.
i. 599: but the name there written “ Hasahah ”
is هُزْلَة; accord. to Meyd, the father, but accord.
to the O, the brother, of Sirhán.]) ―
-b2-  Hence,
(Mgh, Msb,) i. e. from السِّرْحَانُ as meaning “ the
wolf,” or, as some say, “the lion,” (TA,) ذَنَبُ
السِّرْحَانِ The false dawn; (Mgh, O, K, TA;) i. e.
the first [dawn]. (TA. [A term nearly agreeing

by divorcement: (Bd in xxxiii. 28 [where it is
used as a quasi-inf. n., as it is also in verse 48 of
the same chap.]:) like طَلَاقٌ and فِرَاقٌ, it signifies
divorcement explicitly. (L.) ―
-b2-  [And Dismissal
in a general sense. Hence,] it is said in a prov.,
السَّرَاحُ مِنَ النَّجَاحِ (tropical:)  [i. e. Dismissal is a part of
the accomplishment of one's want]; (S, A, L;)
meaning, when thou canst not accomplish a man's
want, make him to despair; for thy doing so will
be in his estimation an act that will stand him in
lieu of thy helping him to accomplish it: (S, L:
[in some copies of the former, for فَأَيْئِسْهُ, we find
فَآيَسْتَهُ:]) or it is applied to a man who does not
desire to accomplish the want [of another]; and
means, it behooves thee to make him to despair if
thou accomplish not his want. (Meyd. [See a
similar prov. voce شَرَاحٌ.]) ―
-b3-  Also Haste, ex-
pedition, or promptness. (TA.) ―

and K in art. روح) and rest. (A in that art.)
