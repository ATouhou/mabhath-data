تَسْهِيمٌ The making a garment to be marked
with stripes or lines [like سِهَام, i. e. arrows: see
the pass. part. n. below]. (KL. [And the same
meaning is indicated in the TA.]) Dhu-r-Rummeh
says, describing a dwelling, [or rather the traces
thereof,]
كَأَنَّهَا بَعْدَ أَحْوَلٍ مَضَيْنَ لَهَا
بِالأَشْيَمَيْنِ يَمَانٍ فِيهِ تَسْهِيمُ
[As though it were, after years had passed with
respect to it, in El-Ashyamán, a garment of
El-Yemen in which was a marking with stripes
or lines: the epithet يَمَانٍ being often applied to
a garment of this kind, and ثَوْبٌ being here
understood]: (TA:) الأَشْيَمَانِ, or, as some call

mentioned by Dhu-r-Rummeh in several places
in his poetry. (TA in art. شيم.)

drew, lots [or more properly arrows for sortilege,
as expl. in the PS,] with him; practised sortilege
[or sortilege with arrows] with him; or competed

(TA;) aor. of the latter verb
سَهَمَ, (S,) and inf. n.

drawing, lots [or arrows for sortilege] or in practising sortilege [or sortilege with arrows] with
him, and overcame him therein; or He did so with
them, and overcame them therein. (S, * TA.)

where [the objective complement] أَهْلَ السَّفِينَةِ is
understood. (Jel.) ―
-b3-  [And hence, He shared

-A2-
And أَسْهَمَ is syn. with أَسْهَبَ, (K, TA,) meaning

تساهموا: see 8. ―
-b2-  [Hence, They shared
together.] El-Hakam El-Khudree says,
ثَوْبَاهَا فَفِى الدِّرْعِ رَادَةٌ تَسَاهَمَ
وَفَى المِرْطِ لَفَّاوَانِ رِدْفُهُمَا عَبْلُ
i. e. Her two garments shared together; for in
the shift was a soft, or tender, body, with a slender
waist, and within the waist-wrapper were too

سَهْمٌ An arrow; i. e. one of what are called
نَبْل, (Msb, K, TA,) having the iron head [and
the feathers] affixed: (TA:) the سَهْم before it
has its feathers and its iron head affixed to it is
[generally] called قِدْحٌ: (S and K in art. قدح:)
accord. to some it signifies the iron head itself;
i. q. نَصْلٌ; (Msb;) ISh says that this is its meaning; and he says, if one pick up a نصل, you say
“ What is this سَهْم with thee? ” but if one pick
up a قِدْح, you do not say thus; and the نَصْل is
the broad and long سَهْم, and may be nearly of the
length of the space between the extremity of the
thumb and that of the fore finger when they are
stretched out; and the مِشْقَص is of half the size
of the نَصْل: (TA:) [but this meaning of سَهْمٌ
seems to be very rare, and little known:] the pl.
[of mult.] is سِهَامٌ (S, TA) and [of pauc.] أَسْهُمٌ.
(TA.) [Hence,] سَهْمُ الرَّامِى (assumed tropical:)  [The arrow of the
archer], (K,) or [simply] السَّهْمُ [the arrow],
(Kzw,) a certain constellation, (K, * Kzw,) [namely
Sagitta,] one of the northern constellations, composed of five stars, between the bill [meaning the

الطَّائرُ [which consists of the stars
α and
β and
γ
of Aquila], in the Great Milky Way, having its
head towards the east and its notch towards the
west; and its length, as it appears to the eye,
when it is in the middle of the sky, is about two
cubits (نَحْوُ ذِرَاعَيْنِ: see ذِرَاعٌ). (Kzw.) ―
-b2-  Also
The قِدْح [or featherless and headless arrow] with
which one casts, or draws, lots, (IAth, Mgh, TA,)
in the game called المَيْسِر; (IAth, Mgh, TA;) and the
قِدْح with which one plays at a game of hazard
[of any kind; i. e. an arrow for sortilege, and a
gaming-arrow]; the primary meaning of the
word being the missile سَهْم; (Mgh;) or the primary meaning is the قِدْح with which one casts,
or draws, lost in the game called المَيْسِر: (IAth,
TA:) pl. سِهَامٌ (K) [and أَسْهُمٌ, as above]. See a
verse cited voce رَقِيبٌ. ―
-b3-  Then applied to The

the game above mentioned]. (IAth, TA.) ―
-b4-  And
then (IAth, TA) applied also to A lot, share, or
portion, (S, IAth, Mgh, Msb, K, TA,) whatever
it be; (IAth, TA;) as also ↓ سُهْمَةٌ: (S, Msb, K:)
pl. of the former سُهْمَانٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and
سِهَامٌ [both pls. of mult.] and أَسْهُمٌ [pl. of pauc.]
(Mgh, Msb, TA) and [quasi-pl. n.] ↓ سُهْمَةٌ, (M,
K, TA,) this last like أُخْوَةٌ. (TA.) It is said in
a trad., كَانَ لَهُ سَهْمٌ مِنَ الغَنِيمَةِ شَهِدَ أَوْ غَابَ
[There was, or is, for him a share of the spoil
whether he were, or be, present or absent]. (TA.)
And one says, فُلَانٍ مِنْ هٰذَا كَذَا ↓ سُهْمَةُ The
share of such a one, of this, is such a thing: and
it may be from السِّهَامُ meaning the arrows (قِدَاح)
that are shuffled among the persons competing in
sortilege, in order that each one may appropriate
to himself what comes forth for him as his share.
(Ham p. 579.) ―
