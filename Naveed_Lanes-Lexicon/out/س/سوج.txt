inf. n.] سَوَجَانٌ signifies The act of going and
coming: (AA, O, K, TA:) asserted by some to

for its huge size, and enormous leaves: or the
Indian, or Oriental, plane-tree: or the Indian
plantain-tree: (see De Sacy's Chrest. Ar., sec.
ed., iii. 473:)] a certain species of tree, (S, A,
Mgh, O, Msb, K,) of great size, (Msb,) growing
to a very great size, (Mgh,) that grows only in
India, and is conveyed thence to other countries;
(Mgh, Msb;) so they say: (Mgh:) Z says,
(Msb,) it is a black, heavy, wood, which is brought
from India, (A, Msb,) in pieces made of an oblong
form, and squared, (A,) and which the woodfretter can hardly, or not at all, wear, or waste;
(A, Msb;) and he says that its pl. is سِيجَانٌ:
(Msb: [but this is said in the A only to be pl. of
ساج meaning “ a rounded, wide, طَيْلَسَان: ”])
some say that it resembles ebony, but is less black:
(Msb:) accord to the A, Noah's ark was made
of it: but several authors say that it is related in
the Book of the Law revealed to Moses that it
was made of the صَنَوْبَر [or pine-tree]; and some
say that the صنوبر is a species of the ساج: (TA:)
AHn describes it, (O, TA,) on the authority of
one who had seen it in its places of growth, (O,)
as a species of tree that grows to a great size, tall
and wide, having leaves like the shields of the
Deylem (الدَّيْلَم, q. v.), with one of which leaves a
man may cover himself, and it will protect him
from the rain, and it has a sweet odour, like the
odour of the leaves of the walnut, and is fine and
soft, or smooth; (O, TA,) the elephants [he says]
are fond of it, and of the leaves of the banana,
both of which they eat: it is not of the trees
that grow in the land of the Arabs, nor does it
grow in any country except those of India and
the Zenj; nor does any tree grow so tall, nor
any so big: (O:) ↓ سَاجَةٌ is the n. un.; and its
