سجد1
سَجَدَ, (S, A, Msb, K, &c.,) [aor.
سَجُدَ,] inf. n.
سُجُودٌ, (Msb,) He was, or became, lowly, humble, or submissive; syn. خَضَعَ, (S, A, K, TA,) or
تَطَامَنَ, and ذَلَّ: (Msb:) or he bent him-self down
towards the ground: (Aboo-Bekr, TA: [and
such is often meant by خَضَعَ and by تَطَامَنَ:])
[or it has both of these significations combined;
i. e. he was, or became, lowly, humble, or submissive, bending himself down; for] the primary
signification of السُّجُودُ is تَذَلُّلً together with
تَطَأْمُنٌ [or تَطَامُنٌ]. (Bd in ii. 32.) And ↓ اسجد
He lowered his head, and bent himself; (AA, S,
Mgh, K;) said of a man; (AA, S, Mgh;) and
put his forehead on the ground: (Mgh:) and
likewise said of a camel; (S, A;) in the latter
case tropical; (A;) as also سَجَدَ; (A, Mgh,
Msb;) meaning (tropical:)  he lowered his head, (S, A,
Mgh, Msb,) to be ridden, (S, Mgh,) or to his
rider, (A,) or on the occasion of his being ridden,
or mounted. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  The سُجُود of prayer is
from سَجَدَ in the first of the senses expl. above;
(S;) and means The [prostrating oneself;] putting the forehead on the ground: (S, Mgh:)
سَجَدَ, (ISd, Msb, TA,) aor. and inf. n. as above,
(ISd, TA,) signifies he put his forehead on the
ground: (ISd, Msb, TA:) but سُجُود to God
denotes a particular manner [of doing this; i. e.
the prostrating oneself in prayer by dropping
gently upon the knees, placing the palms of the
hands on the ground, a little before the place of
the knees, and then putting the nose and forehead
on the ground, the former first, between the two
hands]. (Msb.) ―
-b3-  It is said of Kisrà, in a trad.,
كَانَ يَسْجُدْ لِلطَّالِع, i. e. He used to lower himself, or bend himself down, to the arrow passing
beyond the butt, going over it; which they used
to reckon like that which hit the butt; meaning
that he used to concede to the shooter thereof:
or, accord. to Az, it means that he used to lower
his head when his arrow was elevated [too high]
above the object shot at, in order that the arrow
might be rightly directed, and might hit the
circle. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And [as salutation is often
accompanied with a bending of the body,] سُجُودٌ
also signifies (assumed tropical:)  The act of saluting. (L, TA.)
[You say, سَجَدَ لَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He saluted him. And also
(assumed tropical:)  He paid respect, or honour, to him; or magnified him; see Ham p. 294.] ―
-b5-  You say also,
سَجَدَتِ النَّخْلَةُ (tropical:)  The palm-tree bent, or inclined,
(AHn, Mgh, TA,) by reason of the abundance of
its fruit. (Mgh.) And السَّفِينَةُ تَسْجُدُ لِلرِّيحِ (tropical:)  The
ship bends, or inclines, by the influence of the
wind. (A, TA.) ―
-b6-  وَ النَّجْمُ وَ الشَّجَرُ يَسْجُدَانِ, in
the Kur [lv. 5], means, accord. to Fr, (assumed tropical:)  [And
the herbs and the trees] turn towards the sun
and incline with it until the afternoon-shade becomes broken: (TA:) or the herbs and the trees
humbly submit to his will. (Bd, Jel.) The سُجُود
of inanimate things to God we understand, in the
Kur, as denoting obedience to that whereto they
are made subservient, and as a fact to be believed
without inquiry into the manner thereof. (I'Ab,
L.)
-A2-  Also He stood erect: (Lth, Msb, K:) so
in the dial. of Teiyi. (Msb.) It is said in the
K, immediately after the mention of the first
signification and this last, that thus the verb has
two contr. meanings: but it may be said that
there is no [necessary, or absolute,] contrariety
between الخُضُوع and الاِنْتِصَاب. (MF.)
-A3-  سَجِدَتْ
رِجْلُهُ, aor.
سَجَدَ, (tropical:)  His leg became inflated, or swollen. (K, TA.)

indicative of [amorousness, and feigned coyness
or opposition, or] confidence in one's love, and
consequent presumptuousness: (TA:) or he had a
languid, or languishing, eye. (L.) ―
-b3-  And اسجدت
عَيْنَهَا (tropical:)  She lowered her eye. (A, TA.)

(A, L, TA.) You say, بَسَطَ سَجَّادَتَهُ &c. [He
spread his prayer-mat, or prayer-carpet]. (A.)
―
-b2-  And The mark of سُجُود [or prostration in
prayer] upon the forehead [when dust adheres to
it]. (S, A, Mgh.)
سُجَّادَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
سَاجِدٌ act. part. n. of سَجَدَ: (L:) [Being lowly,
humble, or submissive: bending himself down
towards the ground: &c.: and hence, prostrating
himself in prayer; putting his forehead on the
ground: &c.:] pl. سُجَّدٌ (S, A, L) and سُجُودٌ.
(L.) ―
-b2-  وَ ادْخُلُوا الْبَابَ سُجَّدًا, in the Kur [ii. 55
and vii. 161], means And enter ye the gate bending down your heads: (I'Ab, K:) it was a narrow

دَرَاهِم الأَسْجَاد, (O, K,) or الإِسْجَاد, (S, O, K,)
thus some relate it, with kesr to the ء, (O, K,)
in the saying of El-Aswad Ibn-Yaafur.
مِنْ خَيْرِ ذِى نَطَفٍ أَغَنَّ مُنَطَّقٍ
وَافَى بِهَا لِدَرَاهِمِ الإِأَسْجَادِ
[Of the wine of one with earrings, having a nasal
twang, girded with a waist-belt, i. e., of a
foreigner: he brought it for what are termed
دراهم الاسجاد], (S, * O, K, but in the copies of the
K كَدَرَاهِم, [which I think a mistranscription,])
means dirhems whereon were effigies to which
people performed the act of سُجُود: (S, O, K:)
it is said that upon them was the effigy of Kisrà,
and he who beheld them lowered his head to them
and showed humility [as the Persians in the present day do to the picture of their King]: (IAmb,
TA:) or الأَسْجَاد means the tax called جِزْيَة:
(O, K:) so says AO, (O,) or A 'Obeyd: (TA:)
or the Jews and the Christians: (O, K:) some
say the former and some say the latter: (O:)
and it is read with kesr to the ء, and expl. as
meaning the Jews, (O, K,) by IAar. (O.) [Whatever be the signification of the last word, the
verse plainly means, “of wine of a foreigner, sold
by him for foreign money. ”]
مَسْجَدٌ The forehead, (S, K,) where is the
mark made by the سُجُوَد [or prostration in
prayer]. (S.) [Said in the TA to be tropical;
but not so accord. to the A.] And sing. of
مَسَاجِدُ which signifies The parts of a man that
are the places of سُجُود; (Lth, Mgh, Msb, L;)
المَسَاجِدُ meaning the forehead, the nose, the
hands, the knees, and the feet: (Mgh, L:) or
the forehead, the hands, and the knees: (Mgh:)
or the seven آرَاب; (S, K;) namely, the forehead,
the hands, the knees, and the feet: (TA in art.
ارب:) such, accord. to some, is its meaning in
the Kur lxxii. 18. (L.) ―
-b2-  See also the next paragraph, in two places.
مَسْجِدٌ [Any place in which one performs the
act of سُجُود, or acts of worship or devotion;
and particularly a mosque; a Muslim temple;
an oratory;] a house in which one performs the
act of سُجُود; (IB;) a house of prayer; (Mgh,
Msb;) any place in which one performs acts of
worship or devotion: (Zj:) a word of well-known
meaning; (K;) sing. of مَسَاجِدُ; (S, Mgh, K;)
and also pronounced ↓ مَسْجَدٌ: (S, K:) this latter
word signifies, accord. to IAar, the مِحْرَاب [here
meaning oratory, or place of private prayer,] of
a house; and the place of prayer of the congregations; (TA;) or it signifies any of the parts
of the ground, as well as of the body, that are the
places of سُجُود: (Lth, L:) or the place of the
forehead [on the ground in the act of prostration
in prayer]. (IB.) Fr says, (S,) the مَفْعل of
every verb of the class of فَعَلَ having its aor. of
the measure يَفْعُلُ is with fet-h to the medial
radical letter, whether it be a subst, or an inf. n.,
(S, K,) without any difference, so that you say,
دَخَلَ مَدْخَلًا, and هٰذَا مَدْخَلُهُ; (S;) except some
words (S, K) among substs., (S,) as مَسْجِدٌ and
مَطْلِعٌ (S, K) and مَغْرِبٌ (S) and مَشْرِقٌ and مَسْقِطٌ
and مَفْرِقٌ and مَجْزِرٌ and مَسْكِنٌ and مَرْفِقٌ (S, K)
from رَفَقَ, aor. يَرْفُقُ, (S,) and مَنْبِتٌ and مَنْسِكٌ
(S, K) from نَسَكَ, aor. يَنْسُكُ; (S;) these being
with kesr (S, K) to the medial radical letter (K)
as a sign of their being substs.; but sometimes
some of the Arabs pronounce it with fet-h in the
subst.: مَسْكِنٌ and مَسْكَنٌ have been transmitted;
and we have heard المَسْجِدُ and ↓ المَسْجَدُ, and
المَطْلِعُ and المَطْلَعُ: and he further says, (S,)
fet-h is allowable, (S, K,) in all of these, (S,)
even if we have not heard it: but when the verb
is of the class of فَعَلَ having its aor. of the
measure يَفْعِلُ, the n. of place [or time] is with
kesr, and the inf. n. is with fet-h, to distinguish
the one from the other; so that you say, نَزَلَ مَنْزَلًا,
meaning نُزُولًا, and هٰذَا مَنْزِلُةُ, meaning دَارُهُ. (S,
K. *) ―
-b2-  [Hence مَسْجِدٌ جَامِعٌ A congregational
mosque; i. e. a mosque in which a congregation
assembles to perform the Friday-prayers.] المَسْجِدُ
الحَرَامُ [The sacred mosque of Mekkeh]. (Msb
in art. حرم.) المَسْجِدُ الأَقْصَى The furthest mosque
[which is in Jerusalem]. (Msb in art. قصو.)
مَسْجِدُ الخَيْفِ The mosque of the خَيْف [q. v.]
in Minè. (S &c. in art. خيف.) And المَسْجِدَانِ
The two mosques; that of Mekkeh and that of
El-Medeeneh: (S, Mgh:) so in a verse cited in
the first paragraph of art. ثرو. (S.)
مِسْجَدَةٌ: see سَجَّادَةٌ.
