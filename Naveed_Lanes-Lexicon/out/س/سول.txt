سول1
سَالَ, aor. يَسَالُ, (Akh, and S, M, Msb, K, all
in art. سأل,) like خَافَ, aor. يَخَافُ, (Msb and K
ibid.,) first pers. pret. سِلْتُ, [like خِفْتُ,] (Sb, M
in the present art., [in the K in this art., erroneously, سَلْتُ,]) and aor. أَسَالُ, (Sb, M and K in
this art.,) imperative سَلْ, (S, Msb, K, TA, all in
art. سأل,) dual سَلَا, and pl. سَلُوا, these two
being irregular, (Msb in that art.,) inf. n. سُوَالٌ,
(M and K in the present art.,) mentioned by Sb
and by Th, (M ibid.,) and سِوَالٌ, (M and K ibid.,)
mentioned by Th, (M ibid.,) i. q. سَأَلَ [He asked,
&c.], (Akh, and S, M, Msb, K, all in art. سأل,)
and سَأَلْتُ; a dial. var. of the verb with أ, (Sb, M
and K in the present art.,) the medial radical
being originally و, (M and K ibid.,) not a substitute for أ, (M ibid.) as is shown by the phrase
هُمَايَتَسَاوَلَانِ, (M and K ibid.,) mentioned by
AZ: (M ibid.:) it is of the dial. of Hudheyl.
(TA in art. سأل.) [For the pass. (سِيلَ &c.), see
سَأَلَ.] A certain elegant scholar says,
سَالَتْ هَذَيْلٌ رَسُولَ اللّٰهِ فَاحِشَةً
i. e. [Hudheyl] asked of the Apostle of God as a
thing wished for [something beyond measure evil]:
it is not from سَأَلَ, [i. e. it is originally سَوِلَ, not
formed from سَأَلَ by the substitution of ا for أ,]
as many of the elegant scholars say. (Er-Rághib,
TA.)
-A2-  سَوِلَ, (M, K,) [aor. يَسْوَلُ,] inf. n. سَوَلٌ,
(M,) He, or it, was, or became, lax, flaccid, or
uncompact; or it hung down loosely; was, or
became, pendent, or pendulous: (M, K:) [or,
said of a man, he was, or became, flaccid, or pendulous, in the belly, or in the part of the belly
below the navel; as appears from an explanation of
أَسْوَلُ and from what here follows:] سَوَلٌ, (S,
TA,) in the K, erroneously, ↓ سَوْلَة, (TA,) signifies flaccidity, or uncompactness, or pendulousness, (S, K, TA,) of the belly, (K,) and so ↓ تَسَوُّلٌ
and تَسَوُّنٌ, (TA,) or of the part of the belly below
the navel; (S, TA;) and of other things, (K,
TA,) as, for instance, (TA,) of a cloud also.
(S, TA.)

سَوَّلَتْ لَهُ نَفْسُهُ أَمْرًا, (S,) or كَذَا, (M, K,) or
الشَّىْءَ, (Msb,) inf. n. تَسْوِيلٌ, (TA,) His soul embellished [or commended] to him (S, M, Msb, * K)
a thing, or an affair, (S,) or such a thing, (M,
K,) or the thing: (Msb:) or made it [to appear]
easy to him, and a light matter in his eyes; from
سَوَلٌ signifying “ laxness ” or the like: (Bd in
xii. 18:) the inf. n. signifies the embellishing, a
thing, and making it to be loved or approved, in
order that one may do it or say it: (TA:) or the
soul's embellishing a thing that is eagerly desired,
and picturing what is foul thereof as goodly:
(Er-Rághib, TA:) and it is said to be from سُولٌ
signifying “ an object of a man's desire, which
embellishes to the seeker thereof that which is
false, or vain, and other things of the deceptions
of the present world. ” (TA.) ―
-b2-  You say also,
يُسَوَّلُ إِلَىَّ كَذَا Such a thing is imaged in the
mind to me; is an object of fancy to me; or
seems to me. (L in art. هد.) ―
-b3-  And سوّل لَهُ said
of the Devil, He led him into error; or made him
to err: (M, K:) or facilitated to him the commission of great sins; from سَوَلٌ meaning as expl.
above in this paragraph: or incited him to indulgence in appetences, or lusts; from السُّولُ meaning
[by implication] التَّمَنِّى: (Bd in xlvii. 27:) or
[as though meaning] let down his rope [to him to
aid in the accomplishment of his desire]. (Ham
p. 748.)

-A2-  and 1, last sentence,
in the present art.

هُمَايَتَسَاوَلَانِ [They two ask, or beg, each
other; i. q. يَتَسَآءَلَانِ, q. v.]: (M, K:) a phrase
mentioned by AZ. (M.)
سُولٌ i. q. مَسْأَلَةٌ [as signifying A petition; or a
request; meaning a thing that is, or has been,
asked, or begged; see سُؤْلٌ]; (TA;) as also
↓ سُولَةٌ; (K, TA;) each, (TA,) a dial. var. of the
word with ء: (K, TA: [but it is also said in the
latter that سُؤْلٌ is the original of سُولٌ because the
readers of the Kur-án read the word with ء in
chap. xx. verse 36:]) or an object of desire or
wish (أُمْنِيَّةٌ), which one asks; (TA:) or an object
of want, which the soul eagerly desires: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or an object of a man's desire
(أُمْنِيَّةٌ), which embellishes to the seeker thereof
that which is false, or vain, and other things of
the deceptions of the present world: but there is
a difference between سُولٌ and ↓ سُولَةٌ on the one
hand and أُمْنِيَّةٌ on the other hand, in that the
former relate to what is sought, or demanded,
and امنيّة relates to what is meditated (قُدِّرَ);
(TA;) [for] this last primarily signifies “ a thing
that a man meditates (يُقَدِّرُهُ) in his mind,” from
مَنَى signifying قَدَّرَ; (Bd in ii. 73;) so that the
↓ سُولَة seems to be after the أُمْنِيَّة: (TA:) سُولٌ
may be from سَوَّلَتْ لَهُ نَفْسُهُ كَذَا in the first of the
senses assigned to it above, and [from] سَوَّلَ said
of the Devil in the last of the senses assigned to it
above. (Ham p. 748.) [See also سُوَالٌ, below.]
سَوْلَةٌ: see 1, last sentence.
سُولَةٌ: see سُولٌ, in three places.
سُوَلَةٌ, (M, K,) applied to a man, (M,) One
who asks, or begs, much; (K;) i. q. [سُؤَلَةٌ and]
سَؤُولٌ. (M.)
سُوَالٌ an inf. n. of سَالَ as syn. with سَأَلَ: (Sb,
Th, M, K:) [and used as a simple subst., like
سُولٌ and سُولَةٌ, for] IJ mentions أَسْوِلَةٌ as its pl.
(M, TA.)
سَوِيلٌ An equal. (M, K.) So in the saying,
أَنَا سَوِيلُكَ فِى هٰذَا الأَمْرِ [I am thy equal in this
affair]. (M.)
أَسْوَلُ Lax, flaccid, or uncompact; or hanging
down loosely; or pendent, or pendulous; in the
lower part: (M, K:) or a man flaccid, or pendulous, in the part of the belly below the navel:
fem. سَوْلَآءُ: and pl. سُولٌ. (S.) And سَحَابٌ أَسْوَلُ
Clouds that are uncompact, (S, TA,) their skirts,
or fringes, hanging down; and in like manner,
سَحَائِبُ سُولٌ; sing. سَحَابَةٌ سَولَآءُ. (TA.) And
دَلْوٌ سَوْلَآءُ A large bucket. (M, K. *)
