سبق1
سَبَقَهُ, (S, O, Msb, K, &c.,) aor.
سَبِقَ (O, Msb,
K) and
سَبُقَ, (O, K,) but the former is of higher
authority, or more usual, (O, TA,) inf. n. سَبْقٌ,
(S, Msb,) He preceded him; he was, or became,
got, went, or came, before him, or ahead of him;
he outwent, or outstripped, him; he had, got, or
took, precedence of him; syn. تَقَدَّمَهُ; (K, TA;)
in running, and in everything. (TA.) Some
read, in the Kur [xxi. 27], لَا يَسْبُقُونَهُ بِالقَوْلِ, thus,
with damm, meaning They say not [anything]
without his having taught them: (O, TA:) or
they say not anything until He has said it:
originally, لَا يَسْبُِقُ قَوْلُهُمْ قَوْلَهُ [their saying does
not precede his saying]: this reading is from the
phrase سَابَقْتُهُ فَسَبَقْتُهُ, [expl. below,] aor. of the
latter أَسْبُقُهُ. (Bd.) See 3. ―
-b2-  سَبَقَ الفَرَسُ فِى
الحَلْبَةِ The horse outstripped, or came in first,
among those started together for a wager, or in
the race-ground. (O, K.) Hence the trad. of
'Alee, سَبَقَ رَسُولُ اللّٰهِ وَصَلَّى أَبُو بَكْرٍ وَثَلَّثَ عُمَرُ
(assumed tropical:)  [The Apostle of God came in first in the race,
and Aboo-Bekr came in next, and 'Omar came
in third]. (O, TA.) [And سَبَقَ used in like
manner with the objective complement understood means He preceded, &c., as above; and
hence, he was, or became, first, foremost, or
beforehand; he had, or got, the priority, or precedence. And He was, or became, one of the
first or foremost: see سَابِقٌ. See also قَصَبُ السَّبْقِ
in art. قصب.] ―
-b3-  سَبَقَ النَّاسَ إِلَى الأَمْرِ [He preceded the other people; was, or became, before
them; or had, got, or took, precedence of them;
in betaking, or applying, himself to the affair].
(S, K.) And in like manner one says, لَهُ سَبْقٌ فِى
هٰذَا الأَمْرِ To him belongs priority, or precedence,
in this affair; like سَابِقَةٌ; syn. قُدْمَةٌ. (A, TA.)
―
-b4-  [Hence,] سَبَقَ وَهْمُهُ إِلَى شَىْءٍ فَغَلِطَ فِيهِ (assumed tropical:)  [He
preconceived a thing, and therefore made a mistake, or erred, respecting it]. (Msb, in explanation of دُخِلَ عَلَيْهِ.) [And سَبَقَ ذِهْنُهُ إِلَى الشَّىْءِ
means in like manner (assumed tropical:)  He preconceived the
thing: or his mind adverted hastily, before reflection, or without premeditation, to the thing;
from what next follows.] ―
-b5-  سَبَقَ إِلَيْهِمْ He went,
or passed, hastily, or quickly, to them. (TA.) ―
-b6-
[And hence,] سَبَقَ إِلَيْهِ مِنِّى قَوْلٌ (assumed tropical:)  A saying proceeded hastily, before reflection, or without premeditation, to him from me; syn. فَرَطَ: (S in
art. فرط:) and سَبَقَ مِنْهُ كَلَامٌ (assumed tropical:)  speech proceeded
hastily, &c., from him; syn. فَرَطَ: (Msb in that
art.:) [but this phrase also means, more agreeably
with the primary signification of the verb, (assumed tropical:)  speech
proceeded previously from him; (see the Kur
x. 20, &c.;) and in like manner the former phrase.]
See also 8. And سَبَقَهُ القَىْءُ, (S, Msb, K, all in
art. ذرع,) i. e. سَبَقَهُ فِى الخُرُوجِ إِلَى فِيهِ [meaning
(assumed tropical:)  The vomit came forth to his mouth before he
was aware]. (TA in that art.) [And سَبَقَ القَلَمُ
(assumed tropical:)  The pen anticipated, skipping over something,
in transcribing.] ―

meaning (tropical:)  I overcame him. (TA.) And سَبَقَ
عَلَى قَوْمِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He overcame his people in generosity.
(TA.) And سَبَقَهُ فِى الكَرَمِ (assumed tropical:)  He exceeded him in
generosity. (TA.)

سبّق, (inf. n. تَسْبِيقٌ, Mgh,) He took, or received, the سَبَق [i. e. stake, or wager, laid at a
race or a shooting-match, to be taken by the successful competitor]: (IAar, O, K:) or سَبَّقْتُهُ I
took, or received, the سَبَق, from him. (Az, Mgh,
Msb.) ―
-b2-  And He gave the سَبَق: (IAar, O, K:)
or سَبَّقْتُهُ I gave him the سَبَق. (Az, Mgh, Msb.)
Thus it has two contr. significations. (IAar, Az,
Mgh, O, Msb, K.) Hence, in the trad. of Rukáneh the wrestler, مَا تُسَبِّقُنِى, i. e. What wilt
thou give me [if I overcome] ? and he said, The
third of my sheep, or goats. (Mgh.) And سَبَّقَ
البَدْرَةَ بَيْنَ الشُّعَرَآءِ (tropical:)  He made the [sum of money
termed] بدرة to be a سَبَق [i. e. stake, or wager,]
among the poets, to be taken by him who should

أَمَرَ بِإِجْرَآءِ الخَيْلِ وَسبَّقَهَا ثَلَاثَةَ أَعْذُقٍ مِنْ ثَلَاثِ
نَخَلَاتٍ, meaning [He ordered the making of the
horse to run, and] gave them as a سَبَق [three
racemes of dates from three palm-trees]: or it
may mean, he took, or received, as their سَبَق:
or it [i. e. سبقها] may be without teshdeed, [as a
subst. with its affixed pronoun,] meaning the
property assigned [as their سَبَق]. (L, TA.) ―
-b3-
One says also, سَبَّقْتُ بَيْنَ الخَيْلِ [app. meaning
I gave a سَبَق among the horses]: (O:) or سَبَّقْتُ
الخَيْلَ, and بَيْنَهَا ↓ سابقت, meaning I sent forth
the horses with their riders upon them, to see
which of them would outstrip. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And
سبّقت الشَّاةُ, inf. n. as above, The ewe, or she-goat,
cast her young one, or fœtus, in an incomplete
state: (Ibn-'Abbád, O, K:) but سبّغت, with غ,
is better known. (Ibn-'Abbád, O.)
-A2-  سَبَّقْتُ
الطَّائِرَ (tropical:)  I put the سِبَاقَانِ [or pair of jesses] upon
the legs of the bird, and [so] shackled it. (TA.)

سَابَقْتُهُ, inf. n. مُسَابَقَةٌ and سِبَاقٌ, [I strove, or
contended, with him to precede him; to be, or
become, get, go, or come, before him, or ahead of
him; to outgo, or outstrip, him; to have, get, or
take, precedence of him; in running (i. e. I
raced, or ran a race, with him); and in everything.] (Msb, TA.) You say, ↓ سَابَقْتُهُ فَسَبَقْتُهُ [I
strove, or contended, with him to precede him,
&c., and I surpassed him, or overcame him, in
doing so]: (S:) the aor. of the latter verb in this
case is أَسْبُقُهُ, (Bd in xxi. 27,) and the inf. n. is
سَبْقٌ. (S.) ―
-b2-  See also 6. ―
-b3-  And see 2.

اسبق القَوْمُ إِلَى الأَمْرِ [perhaps a mistranscription for ↓ استبق] The people, or party,
hastened to the thing, or affair; or employed the
fulness of their power, or force, to hasten to it;
syn. بَادَرُوا. (TA.)
6
تسابقا and ↓ استبقا signify the same: (K,
TA:) thus the saying [in the Kur xii. 25]
البَابَ ↓ وَاسْتَبَقَا means تَسَابَقَا إِلَيْهِ, i. e. And they
strove, or contended, each with the other, to precede, or get before, to the door. (TA.) [And
both are trans. by means of إِلَى:] you say,
تسابقوا إِلَى كَذَا and إِلَيْهِ ↓ استبقوا [They strove,
or contended, together, to precede, or be first, in
attaining to such a thing: and so ↓ سَابَقُوا: see
the Kur lvii. 21, here سَابِقُوا إِلَى مَغْفِرَةٍ is expl.
by Bd as meaning سَارِعُوا مُسَارَعَةَ المُسَابِقِينَ فِى
المِضْمَارِ i. e. Strive ye, one with another, in
hastening, with the striving of those that contend
to outstrip in the hippodrome, to obtain forgiveness]. (Msb.) And you say, فِى العَدْوِ ↓ اِسْتَبَقْنَا,
meaning تَسَابَقْنَا [i. e. We strove, or contended,
one with another, to precede, get before or ahead,
or outstrip, in running: and in like manner each
of these verbs is used in relation to any object of
contention for precedence]. (S.) ―
-b2-  And تسابقوا
and ↓ استبقوا (tropical:)  They competed, or contended, together in shooting. (TA.) ↓ ذَهَبْنَا نَسْتَبِقُ, in the
Kur [xii. 17], means (assumed tropical:)  We went to compete, or
contend, together in shooting: (S, Bd:) or in
running. (Bd.) ―
-b3-  And ↓ the latter of these verbs,
as well as the former, signifies also They laid bets,
wagers, or stakes, one with another. (TA.)
8
إِسْتَبَقَ [استبقهُ and استبق إِلَيْهِ i. q. بَادَرَ إِلَيْهِ. Thus]

means Therefore hasten ye to good acts, &c.;
or employ the fulness of your power, or force, in

-b3-  فَاسْتَبَقُوا الصِّرَاطَ, in the Kur

because of إِلَى suppressed before it, or by making
الاِسْتِبَاقُ to imply the meaning of الاِبْتِدَارُ, (Bd,)
means And they would hasten, make haste, or
strive to get first or beforehand, to the road that
they were wont to travel: (Bd, Jel:) or (tropical:)  they
would go along the road and leave it behind
them, (Bd, * O, K, TA,) so that they would
wander from the right way. (O, K, TA.) ―

سِبْقٌ A competitor of another in striving to
precede, to be before or ahead, to outgo or outstrip, or to have precedence: [pl. أَسْبَاقٌ; and the

as [sometimes happens] in the case of the سابق of
horses: and sometimes it is like him who obtains
the winning-cane (قَصَبَة السَّبْق [see art. قصب]);
for he outstrips to it and has none to share with
him in it, there being none coming up with him.
(Msb.) It is applied to a horse That outstrips;

is سُبَّقٌ and [fem., i. e. pl. of سَابِقَةٌ,] سَوَابِقُ: (TA:)
