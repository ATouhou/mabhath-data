سطن2
سطّن a verb of which only the pass. part. n.
(q. v. infrà) is mentioned: if used, app. signifying
He supported upon أَسَاطِين, i. e. columns: ―
-b2-
and hence, upon long legs: ―
-b3-  and he made
firm.]
سَاطِنٌ i. q. خَبِيثٌ [Bad, corrupt, &c.; like
شَاطِنٌ]. (M, L, K.)
أَسْطَانٌ [a pl. of which the sing. is not mentioned] Vessels of صُفْر [or brass]. (L, K.)
أُسْطُوَانٌ, an arabicized word, (Az, L,) [app.
from the Pers. أُسْتُونْ, like the word next following,] A man long in the legs and back. (M,
L.) And A camel long in the neck, (M, L, K,)
or (K) high. (S, M, L, K.) ―
-b2-  What is termed
أُسْتُوَانُ البَيْتِ is well known [app. meaning The
pole of the tent: (see what next follows:) and this
seems to be the primary signification]. (M, L.)
أُسْطُوَانَةٌ a word of well-known meaning, (S,
L,) arabicized from [the Pers.] أُسْتُوِنْ [which
signifies the same], (K,) i. q. سَارِيَةٌ [meaning
A column, of stone or of baked bricks]: (S, M,
L, Msb, K:) pl. أَسَاطِينُ (S, M, * L, Msb, K *) and
أُسْطُوَانَاتٌ: (Msb:) it is of the measure أُفْعُوَالَةٌ,
(S, L, Msb, K,) because its pl. is أَسَاطَينُ, the ن
being radical, (L, Msb,) accord. to Kh (Msb)
and Fr, who says that it is the only instance of
this measure; (L;) or of the measure فُعْلُوَانَةٌ,
(S, L, K,) accord. to Akh, but, (J says, L,) if so,
the و is augmentative and has next to it two
augmentative letters, and this is scarcely ever, or
never, the case; (S, L;) IB, however, says that
this is the true measure, as is shown by its pl.,
أَسَاطِينُ, and its dim., ↓ أُسَيْطِينَةٌ: (L:) accord. to
some, it is of the measure أُفْعُلَانَةٌ, (S, L, Msb,)
but, if it were so, it would not have for its pl.
أَسَاطِينُ, as there is no instance of the measure
أَفَاعِينُ. (S, L.) ―
-b2-  [Also A portico. Hence,
أَهْلُ الأُسْطُوَانَةِ The Stoics. ―
-b3-  And A cylinder.]
―
-b4-  And The legs of a beast: (K:) [or rather the
pl.] أَسَاطِينُ has this meaning. (L.) ―
-b5-  And The
penis. (K.)
أُسَيْطِينَةٌ dim. of أُسْطُوَانَةٌ, q. v. (IB, L.)
مُسَطَّنٌ [app. Supported upon أَسَاطِين, i. e.
columns. ―
-b2-  And hence,] A man, and a beast,
having long legs. (L.) ―
-b3-  And أَسَاطِينُ مُسَطَّنَةٌ
(S, M, L, K,) [Columns] made firm. (K.)
