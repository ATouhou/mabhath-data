is of the dial. of the people of Syria; and I think
that it is Greek, [or perhaps it is from the Latin
“ mustarius,” which is from “ mustum,”] because
it does not resemble an Arabic form: it is with
ص, or, as some say, with س; and [app. a mistake for “ or ”] I think it to be of the measure
مُفْتَعَلٌ from صَارَ, with the ت changed into ط.
