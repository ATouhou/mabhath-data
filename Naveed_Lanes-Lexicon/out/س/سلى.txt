سَلًى or سَلًا [thus differently written, the former
the more correct, unless the word be derived from
السَّلْوَةُ, as it is said to be in the Ham p. 656, but
this is improbable,] The secundine; i. e. the skin,
[or membrane,] (M, K,) or thin skin, (S,) in
which is the fœtus, or young, [in the womb,] (S,
M, Msb, K,) of human beings, and of horses and
camels, (M,) or of human beings and of cattle, (K,)
or [peculiarly] of cattle, (T, S,) that of human
beings being termed مَشِيمَةٌ: (TA:) it is pulled
off from the face of the young camel at the time
of the birth, or else it kills it, like as it does when
it becomes disrupted in the belly: when it comes
forth, the she-camel is safe, and so is the young
one; but if it becomes disrupted in the belly, she
perishes, and so does the young one: (S:) pl.
أَسْلَآءٌ. (M, Msb, K.) [Hence,] one says, اِنْقَطَعَ
السَّلَى فِى البَطْنِ (assumed tropical:)  [The secundine became disrupted in the belly]; (S, Meyd, K;) i. e. artifice
departed [or came to an end]; (S;) a prov.
applied in the case of an affair's becoming beyond
one's power of accomplishment, and coming to an
end; (Meyd;) like the saying, بَلَغَ السِّكِّينُ العَظْمَ
[The knife reached to the bone]. (S, K.) And
هُوَ آكِلُ الأَسْلَآءِ (assumed tropical:)  [He is the eater of secundines];
meaning he is low, base, vile, or sordid. (TA.)
And وَقَعَ القَوْمُ فِى سَلَى جَمَلٍ (assumed tropical:)  [The people, or
party, fell into the like of the secundine of a hecamel]; meaning they fell into a difficult affair
or case; (S, K *) or they fell into an unparalleled
evil; (Meyd;) for the he-camel has no سلى. (S,
Meyd.)
سَلْيَآءُ A ewe, or she-goat, (S, K,) and a she-camel, (S,) whose secundine (سَلَاهَا) has become disrupted [in her belly]. (S, K.) ―
