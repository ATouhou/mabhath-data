سَمُحَ, (S, Msb, K,) aor.
سَمُحَ, (Msb, K,) inf. n.
سَمَاحٌ and سَمَاحَةٌ and سُمُوحٌ and سُمُوحَةٌ and سَمْحٌ
and سِمَاحٌ, (K,) He was, or became, liberal,
bountiful, munificent, or generous; (S, * Msb, *
K;) as also ↓ اسمح: (Msb, K:) but the unaugmented verb commonly known, but faultily
omitted in the K, is سَمَحَ, aor.
سَمَحَ; and this is the
only one mentioned by IKtt and IKoot and a
number of other authors: سَمُحَ, like كَرُمَ, means
he became of the people of السَّمَاحَة [i. e. liberality,
&c.]: (MF:) [but] سَمَحَ and ↓ اسمح both signify as above; he was, or became, liberal, &c.;
and he gave from a motive of generosity and
liberality: this is the correct explanation of both;
though some say that the former only is used in
this sense; and the latter, in relation to compliance and submissiveness. (L.) You say, سَمَحَ بِهِ,
(S, A, Msb,) aor.
سَمَحَ, inf. n. سَمَاحٌ and سَمَاحَةٌ (S, *
A, * Msb) and سُمُوحٌ, (Msb,) He was liberal,
bountiful, munificent, or generous, with it; (S,
A, Msb;) and gave it; and complied therein
with that which was desired of him; as also
↓ اسمح. (Msb.) [And سَمَحَ لَهُ He was liberal,
&c., to him; as also ↓ اسمح; whence,] God is
represented, in a trad., as saying, لِعَبْدِى ↓ أَسْمِحُوا
كَإِسْمَاحِهِ إِلَى عِبَادِى Be ye liberal, &c., to my
servant, [meaning Mohammad,] like as he is
liberal, &c., to my servants. (L.) And سَمَحَ لِى,
(S,) or لَهُ, (A,) He gave (S, A) to me, (S,) or to
him: (A:) and بِكَذَا ↓ سَامَحَهُ he gave him such
a thing. (Msb.) And سَمَحَ لِى بِذٰلِكَ, and
↓ اسمح, and ↓ سامح, He complied with my desire in
that thing. (L: see also a similar phrase below.) ―
-b2-
سَمَحَتْ, said of a she-camel, means She became
submissive, and went quickly: (L:) and ↓ اسمحت
said of a beast (دَابَّة), it became gentle and submissive after being refractory: (L, K: *) and in
like manner ↓ اسمح; (A;) and ↓ سمّح, inf. n.
تَسْمِيحٌ; (L;) said of a camel: (A, L:) or
تَسْمِيحٌ signifies the going an easy pace: (S, L,
K:) and the going quickly: (L, K:) or (so in
the L, but in the K “ and ”) the act of fleeing.
(L, K.) And ↓ اسمح It became easy and submissive. (L.) You say, قَرُونَتُهُ ↓ أَسْمَحَتْ, (S, A,
K,) and قَرِينَتُهُ, as also ↓ سَامَحَتْ, (L,) His mind
became submissive, (S, A, L, K,) لِذٰلِكَ الأَمْرِ to

and ↓ سامح, (Mgh, L,) inf. n. مُسَامَحَةٌ; (S, A,
L, K;) and ↓ اسمح, (Mgh,) and ↓ تسمّح; (L;) also
signify He acted in an easy, or a gentle, manner;
(S, A, Mgh, L, K;) and he made easy, or facilitated; (L;) فِى أَمْرٍ in an affair: (Mgh, L:) and
↓ مُسَامَحَةٌ signifies the acting in an easy, or a
gentle, manner in a contest in thrusting, or piercing,
with spears or the like, and smiting with swords,
and running. (L.) It is said in a well-known
trad., السَّمَاحُ رَبَاحٌ The acting in an easy, or a
gentle, manner, in affairs, is a means of gain, or
profit, to the performer thereof. (L.) And you
say, فِى الأَمْرِ ↓ سامحهُ He acted in an easy, or a
gentle, manner with him. (TK.) And سَمَحَ لَهُ
and بِهِ, and ↓ اسمح, He made [a thing] easy to
him. (L.) And اِسْمَحْ يُسْمَحْ لَكَ (Meyd, Mgh,

[app. to denote that the authority is Isma'eel
Hakkee].) [See also تَسَاهُلٌ, which is often used
as though it were syn. with تَسَامُحٌ.] ―

an intensive sense] ↓ مِسْمَحٌ (T, M, TA) and

and لَمِيحٌ ↓ سَمِيحٌ [app. meaning Such a one is
very liberal, &c.; for in each case the latter epithet
is probably an imitative sequent, and therefore a
corroborative]. (L.) ―
