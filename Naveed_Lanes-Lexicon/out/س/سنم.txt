the head, resembling the ear of corn, (S,) or the
blossom, (K,) has come forth. (S, K.) [And]
سَنِمَةٌ signifies Any tree (شَجَرَة) that does not

وَجْهِ الأَرْضِ, (S, in which it is only mentioned as

خَضْمٌ [inf. n. of خَضَمَ, q. v.]: (TA:) [it is the
n. un. of ↓ سَنَمٌ, the latter being a coll. gen. n., as
is shown by what follows:] AHn says, some
assert that the سَنَمَة is such of the produce of
herbs as resembles the produce of the إِذْخِر [q. v.]
and the like; and such as the produce of the reed,
or cane; and that the most excellent of the سَنَم
are the سَنَم of a herb called the ↓ إِسْنَامَة [n. un. of
إِسْنَامٌ]; and the camels eat it in the manner
termed خَضْمٌ, because of its softness; or, as in
some of the copies [of his work], the camels do
not eat it. (M.)
سَنَامٌ of the camel, (S,) of the he-camel and of
the she-camel, [The hump; i. e.] the highest part
of the back: (M, TA:) [in substance,] it is to
the camel like the أَلْيَة [here meaning the fat of
the tail] to the sheep: (Msb:) pl. أَسْنِمَةٌ (S, M,
Msb, K) [and app. أَسْنَامٌ also, as seems to be
indicated by an explanation of this latter pl. in
what follows]. Hence, in a trad., نِسَآءٌ عَلَى رُؤُوسِهِنَّ
كَأَسْنِمَةِ البُخْتِ [Women upon whose heads are
the like of the humps of the Bactrian camels];

land. (S, K.) And سَنَامُ النَّعْلِ The rising part
of the middle of the upper side of the sandal,
which is in the place of the hollow of the foot.
(Har p. 559.) And أَسْنَامُ نَارٍ The highest parts of
a fire: (EM p. 156, and TA:) أَسْنَام being pl. of
سَنَامٌ, which signifies the highest part of a thing.
(EM ubi suprà.) And سَنَامُ المَجْدِ (assumed tropical:)  The highest
[of a people] in respect of glory. (TA.)

water in Paradise; so called because running
above the elevated chambers (S, K *) and the
pavilions: mentioned in the Kur lxxxiii. 27: (S:)
or a certain fountain, or source, (عَيْنٌ,) in Paradise: so they assert; and this requires its being
determinate, imperfectly decl.: or, accord. to Zj,
a water coming upon them from above, from the
elevated chambers: (M:) or a certain fountain,
or source, coming upon them from above. (K
[and in like manner Az explains it].)
