سرمدسَرْمَدٌ [signifies, or implies,] Continuance, or
incessant continuance, (دَوَام, Kh, M, L, and
اِتِّصَال, Kh, L,) of time, (Kh, M, L,) either of
night or of day. (Kh, L.) [I have said “ or
implies ” because I have not found it used otherwise than as an epithet, in the following senses.]
―
-b2-  Continuing; or continuing incessantly, or
endlessly; syn. دَائِمٌ; (Zj, S, L, K;) or دَائِمٌ لَا
يَنْقَطِعُ. (Nh, L.) It is applied in this sense to
night (Nh, L) [and also to day: to each in the
Kur xxviii. 71 and 72]: and to night as meaning
Long. (L, K.) ―
-b3-  Accord. to El-Fakhr Er-Rázee,
it is derived from السَّرْدُ, which denotes consecutiveness and uninterruptedness, and the م is added
to give intensiveness to the signification: if so,
its proper place is in art. سرد; its measure being
فَعْمَلٌ: (MF:) [thus] its م is augmentative like
the م in دُلَامِصٌ. (Bd in xxviii. 71.) ―
-b4-  One says
also, هُوَ لَكَ سَرْمَدًا He, or it, is thine ever, or for
ever. (Mgh in art. سمد.)
سَرْمَدِىٌّ Having neither beginning nor end.
(KT.)
