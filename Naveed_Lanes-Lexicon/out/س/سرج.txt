سَرُجَ, (K,) inf. n. سَرْجٌ,
(TK,) (assumed tropical:)  He lied; as also سَرِجَ, (O, K,) aor.
سَرَجَ;
(K;) but the latter is outweighed [in authority];
(TA;) like سَدَجَ: (O:) and so ↓ سرّج: (TA:)
and شَرَجَ. (O and K * in art. شرج.) You say,
↓ تَكَلَّمَ فُلَانٌ بِكَلِمَةٍ فَسَرَجَ عَلَيْهَا بِأُسْرُوجَةٍ (assumed tropical:)  [Such a
one spoke a word, or sentence, and followed it
with a lie]. (O.) ―
-b2-  And سَرَجَ الكَذِبَ, aor.
سَرُجَ,
inf. n. سَرْجٌ, (assumed tropical:)  He forged the lie. (TA.) [See
also 2.]
-A2-  سَرَجٌ, as an inf. n., signifies The being
bright, or shining. (KL.) ―

(O, K,) aor.
سَرَجَ, (K,) inf. n. سَرَجٌ, (TK,) said of
one's face, (assumed tropical:)  It was, or became, beautiful: (O:)
or, said of a man, (TA,) (tropical:)  he was or became,
beautiful in his face: (K, TA:) but said by
some, to be post-classical; and by some, to be
strange. (TA.)
-A3-  سَرَجَتْ شَعْرَهَا, (O, K, TA, but
not in the CK,) and ↓ سرّجت, (K, TA, but not
in the O,) [thought by SM to be a mistranscription for سرّحت, with the unpointed ح,] She (a
woman, O) plaited her hair; (O, K;) like
سَجَرَتْهُ. (O.)
-A4-  [سَرَجَ, aor.
سَرُجَ, expl. as signifying
“ Ephippio instruxit instravitve equum ” by Golius and Freytag, by the latter as on the authority
of the S and K, I do not find in either of those
lexicons, nor in any other. The verb having this
meaning is اسرج only.]

سرّجهُ, (A, K,) inf. n. تَسْرِيجٌ, (K,) (tropical:)  He
rendered it beautiful; (A, K;) namely, a person's
face; said of God: (A:) (assumed tropical:)  he adorned, ornamented, decorated, or embellished, it; namely, a
thing. (L.) The meaning given in the K [and
A] has the authority of El-Beyhakee and IKtt
and Es-Sarakustee and IKoot; but Aboo-' AbdAllah Mohammad Ibn-Esh-Shádhilee thought it
to be not of established authority as belonging to
the ancient language. (TA.) [Hence,] one says,
سَرِّجْ إِلَيْهِ أَمْرَكَ (assumed tropical:)  Embellish and elucidate thou to
him thy affair, or case. (Ham p. 326.) ―
-b2-  And i. q.

against me a lie]. (A, TA.) And عَلَىَّ ↓ تسرّج
(tropical:)  He lied, or lied purposely, against me. (A, TA.
[See also تسدّج.]) And إِنَّهُ يُسَرِّجُ الأَحَادِيثَ
(tropical:)  [Verily he forges traditions, or stories]. (A,
TA.) ―
-b4-  See also 1, first sentence.
-A2-  سرّجت
شَعْرَهَا: see 1.

أَسْرَجْتُ السِّرَاجَ (O, Msb, TA) I lighted the
lamp, or wick. (Msb, TA.) ―
-b2-  [And اسرج signifies also He lighted himself or another with a
lamp &c.; and so ↓ استسرج: or each of these,
with بِهِ following it, he employed it (i. e. a lamp,
or oil, &c.,) as a means of light: see اِصْطَبَحَ, in
art. صبح.]

Q. Q. 1
سَرْجَنَ الأَرْضَ He manured the land
with سِرْجِين. (L in art. سرجن.)
سَرْجٌ A certain appertenance of a horse or
similar beast, (Msb, K, *) well known; (S, Msb;)
i. e., his رَحْل [or saddle]: (TA:) an Arabic
word; or, accord. to the Shifá el-Ghaleel, arabicized from سرك [which is written by Freytag
شرك, and said by him to be Pers., but I know
not either of these two words in Pers. with an
apposite meaning]: (TA:) dim. ↓ سُرَيْجٌ: (Msb:)
and pl. سُرُوجٌ. (Mgh, Msb, TA.) [Hence,] مَالَ
سَرْجُكَ (assumed tropical:)  Thy affair, or case, was or has become,
in a disordered, or an unsound, state: a proverbial
saying. (Ham p. 242.)
سُرْجَجٌ Continuing, or lasting; or continuing,
or lasting, long; or, for ever. (O, K.)
سُرْجُوجٌ Foolish, or stupid. (O, K.)
سِرْجِينٌ i. q. زِبْلٌ [i. e. dung of horses or other
solid-hoofed animals, or fresh dung of camels,
sheep and goats, wild oxen, and the like; used
for manure]: (Msb, and K in art. سرجن:) a
foreign, or Pers., word, (Msb,) originally سَرْكِين,
[meaning سَرْگِينْ,] (Msb, K,) arabicized, (Msb,
and S and K in art. سرجن,) by the conversion of
the ك [or گ] into ج, and also into ق, so that one
says also سِرْقِينٌ [q. v.]: As is related to have said,
I know not how to say it, and I only say رَوْثٌ: it is
with kesr to the first letter in order to agree with
Arabic words; fet-h not being allowable, because
there is no instance of the measure فَعْلِيلٌ; though
it is said in the M to be سِرْجِينٌ and سَرْجِينٌ:
(Msb:) [the word being arabicized, all its letters
should be regarded as radical; but] many assert
the ن to be augmentative [and therefore mention
the word, or the two words, in the present art.,
as does the author of the Msb]. (TA.)
سُرْجُوجَةٌ (S, O, K) and ↓ سِرجِيجَةٌ (O, K)
Nature; or natural, native, or innate, disposition, or temper, or the like: (S, O, K, TA:) and
a way, mode, or manner, of acting or conduct or
the like. (S, O, TA.) One says, هُمْ عَلَى سُرْجُوجَةٍ
وَاحِدَةٍ They are of one uniform nature or disposition. (As, S, O.) And الكَرَمُ مِنْ سِرْجِيجَتِهِ
and سُرْجُوجَتِهِ Generosity is a quality of his
nature or disposition. (Lh, TA.) And إِنَّهُ لَكَرِيمُ
السُّرْجُوجَةِ and السِّرْجِيجَةِ Verily he is generous of
nature or disposition. (AZ, TA.)
سِرْجِيجَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
سِرَاجٌ a word of well-known meaning; (S, O,

(the latter of which meanings is assigned to both
of these words by Jel in xxiv. 35,)] (L, Msb,
TA) that gives light by night: (L, TA:) or, properly, a lighted wick; its employment to signify
the place thereof [i. e. a lamp, generally a vessel
of glass having in its bottom a small glass tube into
which the lower part of the wick is inserted,]
being a well-known tropical application: (MF,
TA:) pl. سُرُجٌ. (O, Msb, TA.) [See also مَسْرَجَةٌ.]
―
-b2-  [Hence,] the sun is called a سِرَاج [in the

(S, O,) and السِّرَاجُ, (K,) and سِرَاجُ النَّهَارِ (tropical:)  [The
lamp of day]. (A, TA.) So too is the Prophet.
(Kur xxxiii. 45.) 'Omar, also, is called in a trad.
سِرَاجُ أَهْلِ الجَنَّةِ (assumed tropical:)  [The lamp of the people of
Paradise]. (TA.) And one says, الهُدِى سِرَاجٌ
المُؤْمِنِينَ (tropical:)  [The Kur-án is the lamp of the believers], (A,) or سِرَاجُ المُؤْمِنِ [the lamp of the
believer]. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Also, metaphorically, (tropical:)  The
eye; because of its being often likened to a سِرَاج.
(Har p. 554.)

مَرَّاجٌ (tropical:)  Verily he is a lying person, (A,) or a
great, or habitual, liar, (TA,) who adds, or exaggerates, (يَزِيدُ,) in his narration, or talk, or
discourse. (A, TA.) And it is used alone, [without مَرَّاجٌ,] so that one says, رَجُلٌ سَرَّاجٌ (tropical:)  [A man
who lies much, or habitually, &c.]. (TA.) [See
also سَدَّاجٌ.]
جَبِينٌ سَارِجٌ (assumed tropical:)  [A side of a forehead, or a forehead itself,] clear, or white, [and bright,] like the
سِرَاج [or lamp]. (Th, TA.)
سِيرَجٌ i. q. شَيْرَجٌ; (TA in the present art. and
in art. شرج; [but in the present art., غير الشَّيْرَجِ
is erroneously put for عَيْنُ الشَّيْرَجِ, meaning the
same as الشيرج;]) but vulgar; (TA in art. شرج;)
i. e. Oil of sesame, or sesamum: an arabicized
word, from [the Pers.] شِيرَهٌ. (TA in the present
art.)

also the thing upon which the سِرَاج [app. here
meaning lamp] is put: (O:) or the thing upon
which the ↓ مِسْرَجَة is placed: (Msb:) or ↓ مِسْرَجَةٌ,
with kesr, has the last of these meanings: مَسْرَجَةٌ,
with fet-h, having the first thereof: or, as some
say, the reverse is the case; (Mgh;) [i. e.]
↓ مِسْرَجَةٌ, with kesr, signifies the thing in which
is the wick [and the oil]: and مَسْرَجَةٌ, with fet-h,
the thing upon which that is put: (A, TA:) the
pl. (of either, Mgh) is مَسَارِجُ. (Mgh, Msb.) [See
also سِرَاجٌ.]
