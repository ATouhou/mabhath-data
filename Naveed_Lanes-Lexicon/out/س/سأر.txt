↓ سُؤْرَةٌ: (T:) or a remainder of beverage in the
bottom of a vessel after one has drunk; (S, * A;)
such as is left by a rat or mouse &c. after drinking: (S:) properly applied to a remainder of
water left by the drinker in a vessel or wateringtrough: and tropically to (tropical:)  a remainder of
food, &c.: (Mgh:) and ↓ سُؤْرَةٌ signifies likewise
(tropical:)  a remainder of food: (A:) pl. of the former
أَسْآرٌ, (S, M, Mgh, Msb,) and, by transposition,
آسَارٌ, like آبَارٌ and آرَامٌ, pls. of بِئْرٌ and رِئْمٌ. (M.)
[See also سَائِرٌ, below.] ―
-b2-  الصَّقْرِ ↓ سُؤْرَةُ means

it. (A.) ―
-b3-  And ↓ سُؤْرَةٌ also signifies (tropical:)  A remainder of youthful vigour in a man, (M, K,)
or in a woman who has passed the prime of

-b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  What
is good, or excellent, of property, or of camels or

left when one has parted with the bad.] ―
-b5-  ↓ سُؤْرَةٌ
مِنَ القُرْآنِ (tropical:)  [means A chapter of the Kur-án;]
so called because it is a portion, (A,) or a remainder: (TA:) or it may be from the signification immediately preceding: (L:) or it is a dial.

-b6-  فُلَانٌ
سُؤْرُ شَرٍّ means Such a one is very evil or mischievous. (A.)
سُؤْرَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in
five places.
سَأّرٌ One who leaves a remainder, or residue,
(S, M, K,) of beverage in the bottom of the vessel
from which he has drunk: (S, M:) [and (tropical:)  of
food in a dish; &c.:] deviating from rule, (S,
M,) like جَبَّارٌ from أَجْبَرَ: (S:) [see دَرَّاكٌ, which
is said to be the only other instance of the kind:]
by rule it should be ↓ مُسْئِرٌ; (S, K;) which is
[said to be] also allowable: (K:) but MF denies
this; (TA;) or it may be [regular] from سَأَرَ or
[irregular] from أَسْأَرَ. (T, TA.)
سَائِرٌ The rest, or remainder, (T, and M in art.
سير, and Msb and K,) of a thing, (Z, M, Msb,)
whether little or much; (T, Msb;) and of men,
or people: (Sgh; Msb:) not the whole, or all, as
many imagine it to mean, (Sgh, Msb, K,) though
people use it in this latter sense, (IAth,) which
Sgh asserts to be a vulgar error: (Msb:) it occurs
repeatedly in trads., and always in the former
sense: (IAth:) or it is sometimes used [in chaste
Arabic] in the latter sense: (K:) and is correctly
so used accord. to AAF and J and IJ and ElJawáleekee and IB, the last of whom confirms
this signification by many examples and evident
proofs: but whether, in this sense, it is derived
from السَّيْر, as AAF and J and others hold, or
from سُورٌ the “ wall which surrounds a town or
city,” as others hold, is disputed: (TA:) and
سَارُ الشَّىْءِ is a dial. var. of سَائِرُهُ. (S in art. سير.)
―
-b2-  An Arab of the desert became the guest of a
party, and they ordered the female slave to perfume him; whereupon he said, بَطْنِى عَطِّرِى
وَسَائِرِى ذَرِى [My belly perfume thou, and the
rest of me leave thou]: (K:) but in other lexicons than the K, we find أَعْطِرِى. (TA in art.
عطر.) This saying is a well-known prov. (TA.)
[In the TA it is added that سائري here signifies
the whole of me, or all of me: but this is an evident mistake.] You say this to a man who gives
you what you do not want, and refuses you what
you want. (Sgh, TA in art. عطر.) ―
-b3-  It is related,
also, that a hostile attack was made upon a people,
and they cried out for aid to the sons of their
uncle; but these held back from them until they
had been made captives and taken away; then
they came inquiring respecting them; and the
person asked replied, أَسَائِرَ اليَوْمِ وَقَدْ زَالَ الظُّهْرُ
[What, all the day, when the noon has passed?]
(K:) i. e., Dost thou covet what is remote, (مَا بَعُدَ,
(S, K, TA, in a copy of the S and in one of the
K and in the CK مَا بَعْدُ,) when [reason for]
despair hath become manifest to thee: for when
one wants the whole day, and the noon has passed,
he must despair like as he despairs of accomplishing his want at sunset. (S in art. سير, and K.)
This saying is a prov.; (S, A;) and is used with
reference to a thing which one hopes to attain
when its time has passed. (A.)
[
أَسَائِرُ expl. by Golius as a pl. meaning “ Partes
reliquæ ” is an evident mistake, app. caused by a
misunderstanding of the latter prov. mentioned
above.]
مُسْئِرٌ: see سَأّرٌ.
