part. n. in the PS: but in the KL, I find only
the inf. n. expl. by سَرَاپَرْدَهْ كَرْدَنْ: the verb may,
however, be better expl. as signifying he furnished
with a سُرَادِق, q. v.]
سُرَادِقٌ, said by El-Jawáleekee to be an arabicized word from [the Pers.] سَرَادَرْ or سَرَاطَاقْ,
(MF,) An awning extended over the interior
court of a house: (S, O, Msb, K:) [and the cover
of a tent:] and any tent of cotton: (S, O, K,
and mentioned in the Msb as on the authority of
J:) or a [ tent of the kind called] فُسْطَاط; (Bd
in xviii. 28;) so says AO: (Msb:) also (Msb)
an enclosure around a خَيْمَة [or tent], consisting
of pieces of cloth, without a roof: (Mgh, Msb:)
or an enclosure (حُجْرَة) around a فُسْطَاط: (Ksh
and Bd ubi suprá:) or what surrounds the [tent
called] خَيْمَة and the [tent called] قُبَّة: (Ham
p. 772:) or any wall or enclosure, or [tent such
as is called] مِضْرَب or [such as is called] خِبَآء
that surrounds a thing: (IAth, TA:) pl. سُرَادِقَاتٌ:
(S O, K:) it has this pl., though it is masc.,
because. it has no broken pl. (Sb, TA.) ElKedhdháb El-Hirmázee says, not Ru-beh as in the
“ Book ” of Sb [and in the S], addressing Hakam
Ibn-El-Mundhir Ibn-El-Járood,
سُرَادِقُ المَجْدِ عَلَيْكَ مَمْدُودْ
(assumed tropical:)  [The canopy of glory is extended over thee].
(O, TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] (assumed tropical:)  Dust rising; or spreading, or diffusing itself. (Az, O, K.) ―
-b3-  And
(assumed tropical:)  Smoke rising high, and surrounding a thing.
(Az, O, K.) ―
-b4-  In the Kur xviii. 28, it is applied
to what will surround the unbelievers, of the fire
of Hell, (Ksh, Bd,) as being likened to a فُسْطَاط,
(Bd,) or to an enclosure around a فسطاط; or as
meaning the smoke of the fire; or a wall thereof.
(Ksh, Bd.)
بَيْتٌ مُسَرْدَقٌ (Lth, S, &c.) [A house, or tent,]
having a سُرَادِق: (Ksh in xviii. 28, and PS:) or
having the whole of its upper part, and of its
lower part, مَشْدُود [accord. to the TK here meaning curtained, which seems to be the only apposite rendering, but I know not any authority
for it], (Lth, JK, O, K, TA,) or مَسْدُود [i. e.
closed, &c.]. (So in the CK.)
