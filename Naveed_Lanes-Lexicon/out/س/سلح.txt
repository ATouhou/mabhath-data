سَلْحٌ Excrement, ordure, or dung: (L, TA:
[and evidently so accord. to the Msb; in my copy
of which, and so, app., in the copy used by SM,
immediately after the mention and explanation of
the verb سَلَحَ, is added, وهو سلحة تسمية بالمصدر;
plainly showing, by what follows سلحة, that this
word is a mistranscription for سَلْحُهُ; and that
the meaning is, “and it is its سَلْح, an instance of
the inf. n. used as a subst. properly so called; ”
i. e., the dung of a bird is called its سَلْح; for the
verb is there said to relate to a bird; though in
truth it has a general application:]) or such as is
thin, of any dung: (L, TA: [and this is the
sense in which it is commonly known:]) and
↓ سُلَاحٌ signifies [the same: i. e.] excrement,
ordure, or dung, (S, A, MA, L, K, KL,) of a
human being, (KL,) or of a bird (MA) [and of
any animal]: or thin excrement or dung: (MA:)
this latter is said to be the correct meaning in a
marginal note in a copy of the S: (TA:) the pl.
of the former is سُلُوحٌ and سُلْحَانٌ. (L, TA.)
[رَمَى بِسَلْحِهِ frequently occurs in the Lexicons
&c., meaning He cast forth his excrement, or
ordure; or properly, in a thin state.] يَا سَلْحَ
الغُرَابِ [lit. O dung of the crow], an expression
used by 'Omar, means يَا خَبِيثُ (assumed tropical:)  [O foul, or
filthy, man]. (Mgh.)
سُلْحٌ signifies رُبّ [i. e. Rob, or inspissated
juice, generally of dates,] with which a skin for
clarified butter is rubbed over, (K, TA,) for the
purpose of seasoning it. (TA.)
سِلْحٌ: see سِلَاحٌ.
سَلَحٌ Rain-water in pools left by torrents:
(K:) so says ISh: but not heard by Az from the
Arabs. (TA.)
سُلَحٌ The young of the حَجَل [or partridge];
(S, K;) like سُلَكٌ and سُلَفٌ: (S:) [a coll. gen. n.:
n. un. with ة: for] it is said in the T that سُلَحَةٌ and
سُلَكَةٌ signify the young one of the حَجَل: (TA:)
pl. سِلْحَانٌ, (T, S, K,) like سِلْكَانٌ. (T, TA.)
سِلَحٌ: see سِلَاحٌ.
سُلْحَانٌ: see سِلَاحٌ.
سُلَاحٌ: see سَلْحٌ. ―
-b2-  [Also A looseness, or flux
of thin excrement from the bowels: diarrhœa.]
سِلَاحٌ, (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K, &c.,) as also ↓ سَلِحٌ
(accord. to the K) or ↓ سِلْحٌ (accord. to the Msb)
and ↓ سُلْحَانٌ, (K,) [the last mentioned in the L
as a pl.,] A weapon, or weapons; i. e. an instrument, or instruments, of war; (A, K;) the thing
[or things] with which one fights in war, and
repels, or defends oneself; (Msb;) anything with
which one repels the enemy, as a sword and
spear &c.: (Ham p. 73:) or a weapon, or
weapons, of iron: (Lth, Mgh, K:) it is of the
masc. gender, (S, Msb, TA,) accord. to the more
approved usage, (TA,) or that which most prevails, (Msb,) because in the pl. it takes the form
of أَسْلِحَةٌ, which is a pl. form of a masc. n., (S,
Msb, *) as in the instances of أَحْمِرَةٌ, pl. of حِمَارٌ,
and أَرْدِيَةٌ, pl. of رِدَآءٌ, (S,) but it is also fem.,
(S, Msb, K,) and has also for pls. سُلُحٌ and سُلْحَانٌ,
(L,) and the pl. fem. is سِلَاحَاتٌ. (Msb.) You
say رَجُلٌ ذُو سِلَاحٍ [A man having a weapon or
weapons]. (K.) And قَوْمٌ ذَوُو سِلَاحٍ [A people, or
party, having weapons, or arms]. (S, A, K.) And
لَبِسَ السِّلَاحَ [He wore, or put on, the weapon, or
the weapons, or arms]. (S, A, K.) And أَخَذَ القَوْمُ
أَسْلِحَتَهُمْ The people, or party, took their weapons,
or arms, each taking his. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  A sword

-b6-  ذُو السِّلَاحِ is (tropical:)  an appel-lation of السَّمَاكُ الرَّامِحُ [i. e. The star Arcturus].
(A, TA.) ―
-b7-  And أَخَذَتِ الإِبِلُ سِلَاحَهَا and
بِأَسْلِحَتِهَا mean (tropical:)  The camels became
fat, and of goodly appearance; (A, L, TA;)
i. e. their fat became as though it were weapons
with which they prevented their being slaughtered:

[voce رُمْحٌ,] in art. رمح. (TA.)
سَالِحٌ A man having, (K,) or having with him,

[of the possessive kind, having no verb,] similar
to تَامِرٌ and لَابِنٌ. (TA.)

إِسْلِيحٌ A certain plant, the pasturing upon
which causes the milk (S, K) of the camels (S) to
become abundant: (S, K:) or a certain kind of
tree, or shrub, that has this effect: (L:) [see also
إِسْلِيخٌ:] it was said to an Arab woman of the
desert, “What is thy father's tree? ” and she
answered, شَجَرَةُ أَبِى الإِسْلِيحْ رُغْوَةٌ وَصَرِيحٌ وَسَنَامٌ
إِطْرِيحْ [The tree of my father is the isleeh: froth
upon the milk, and milk free from froth; and a
long, or tall, hump: these are the consequences
of pasturing upon it]: (S, * L:) or it is a certain
herb, or leguminous plant, of those that are
slender and soft (مِنْ أَحْرَارِ البُقُولِ), growing in
the winter, that causes the camels to void سُلَاح
[or thin excrement] when they eat much of it:
or a certain herb (عُشْبَة), resembling the جِرْجِير
[or rocket], growing upon tracts of sand such as
are termed حُقُوف: or a certain kind of plant,
growing conspicuously in plain, or soft, tracts,

(سِنْفَة) stuffed with grains, or seeds, like those of
the poppy; which is one of the plants of the rain
of the صَيْف [here meaning spring (see زَمَنٌ)],
and which causes the cattle to void سُلَاح: n. un.
with ة: Aboo-Ziyád says that the places in
which the اسليح grows are sands. (L.)
مَسْلَحَةٌ A ثَغْر [or frontier of a hostile country]:
(K:) or a place of arms or weapons, (Mgh,) like
a ثَغْر and a مَرْقَب [which is an elevated place of
observation], (S, Mgh, TA,) wherein are parties
that watch the enemy, lest they should make an
invasion at unawares, and , when they see them,
inform their companions, in order that they may

numerous body, in a place of observation, with
the keeping of which they are entrusted, at the
frontier of an enemy's country; a single person
of whom is termed ↓ مَسْلَحِىٌّ; (A, * L;) and
مَسْلَحَةٌ [also] is thus applied to a single person
in a saying of 'Omar: (Mgh:) they are thus
called because of their having weapons, or because
of their occupying the place called مَسْلَحَةٌ: (Nh:)
or the مسلحة of the army are a party of
capturers that go before the army, exploring for
them the way, and searching as spies to learn
news of the enemy, lest the enemy should make a
sudden assault upon them; not suffering any one
of the enemy to enter the territory of the Muslims,
and warning the Muslims of the approach of an
army. (ISh.)
