غنى1
غَنِىَ, (S, MA, Msb, K, *) from المَال, aor.
يَغْنَى, (Msb,) inf. n. غِنًى (S, * MA, Msb, K *)
and غَنَآءٌ, (MA, K, * TK, [but the latter is app.
held by some to be a simple subst.,]) He was, or
became, free from want; in the state, or condition, of having no wants; and also, of having
few wants; or in a state of competence, or sufficiency; or rich, or wealthy; الغِنَى being the
contr. of الفَقْرُ, as also الغَنَآءُ; (K, TA;) and
thus denoting the absence, or non-existence, of
wants, which is [properly, or strictly speaking,]
attributable to none but God; and also the
paucity of wants; (TA;) or syn. with اليَسَارُ:
(S:) and the epithet applied to him of whom
this is said is ↓ غَنِىٌّ, (S:) or ↓ غَانٍ, (Msb,) [or
both, for] both signify the same [as will be shown
below]. (K.) One says غَنِىَ and ↓ استغنى and
↓ تغنّى and ↓ تغانى and ↓ اغتنى, (K, TA, [but
wanting in the CK, and app. in several copies of
the K, though it is said in one place in the K, as
it is in the S, that تغنّى is syn. with استغنى,])
all having one and the same meaning, and
followed by بِهِ [as therewith signifying He was,
or became, free from want; in the state, or condition, of having no want, or need; or in a state
of competence, &c.; by means of it, or him; i. e.
he was, or became, sufficed by it, or him; and
hence, he was, or became, content, or satisfied,
with it, or him]. (TA.) ↓ لَيْسَ مِنَّا مَنْ لَمْ يَتَغَنَّ
بِالقُرْآنِ, (Msb, TA,) a saying of the Prophet,
(Msb,) mentioned in a trad., (TA,) means من لم
↓ يَسْتَغْنِ [i. e. He is not of us who is not content,
or satisfied, with the Kur-án]: so says Sufyán
Ibn-'Oyeyneh; not regarding it as meaning the
utterance of the voice [in chanting]: and A 'Obeyd
says that this obtains extensively in the speech of
the Arabs; that they say ↓ تَغَنَّيْتُ and ↓ تَغَانَيْتُ
in the sense of ↓ اِسْتَغْنَيْتُ. (Az, Msb, TA.)
And one says, غَنِىَ عَنْهُ, inf. n. غِنًى and غُنْيَانٌ,
meaning He was in no need of it [or him]: as
also عنه ↓ استغنى; and غنه ↓ أَغْنَى [which
seems to be rarely used in this sense]: and
↓ غُنْيَةٌ signifies the state of being in no need: and
↓ غَانٍِ, a man free from need. (MA.) [And مَا
عَنْهُ ↓ يَسْتَغْنِى He is not without need, or not free
from want, of it, or him.] And غَنِىَ بِهِ عَنْهُ, (S,
Msb,) i. e. عَنْ غَيْرِهِ, (Msb,) inf. n. غُنْيَةٌ, (S,) or
↓ غُنْيَةٌ is the subst., (Msb,) meaning ↓ استغنى
[He was sufficed by it, or was satisfied, or content, with it, so as to be in no need, or so as to be
free from want, of it, i. e. of another thing]: and
the epithet is ↓ غَنِىٌّ. (Msb.) And [in like
manner] غَنِيَتِ المَرْأَةُ بِزَوْجِهَا (S, Msb, K) عَنْ غَيْرِهِ,
(Msb,) inf. n. غُنْيَانٌ (S, K) and غَنَآءٌ also, (TA,)
meaning ↓ اِسْتَغْنَت [The woman was satisfied, or
content, with her husband, so as to have no want
of other than him]. (S, K) And غَنِيَتْ [alone],
(K, TA,) inf. n. غِنًا [for غِنًى, or perhaps a mistranscription for غَنَآءٌ, as in the next preceding
sentence], She (a woman) was, or became,
such as is termed غَانِيَةٌ [q. v. voce غَانٍ].
(K.) ―
-b2-  غَنِىَ, (TK,) inf. n. غِنًى, (K, TK,) also
signifies He married, or took a wife; [as also
↓ تغنّى; (see Ham p. 226 l. 1, where تَغَنَّتْ
occurs said of a woman as meaning she married;)]
syn. تَزَوَّجَ. (K, * TK. [In the K, only the
inf. n. of the former verb in this sense is mentioned; الغِنَى being there expl. in some copies as
signifying التَّزَوُّجُ; and in others, التَّزْوِيجُ.])
Hence the saying, الغِنَى حِصْنٌ لِلْعَزَبِ [Marriage
is a bulwark to him who has no wife; protecting
him from the attacks of seductive women by
rendering him free from the want of them]:
mentioned by Az. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Also, غَنِىَ, (S, K,)
inf. n. غِنًى, (TA,) He dwelt, or abode, (S, K,)
بِالمَكَانِ in the place: (S:) or غَنِىَ القَوْمُ فِى دَارِهِمْ
The people, or party, dwelt long in their place of
abode: (T, TA:) or غَنِىَ فِى مَكَانِ كَذَا He
dwelt long in such a place, satisfied, or content,
therewith, so as to be in no need of any other.
(Er-Rághib, TA.) كَأَنْ لَمْ يَغْنَوْا فِيهَا, in the Kur
[vii. 90 and xi. 71 and 98], means As though
they had not dwelt therein. (TA.) [See also the
last sentence but two in this paragraph.] ―
-b4-  And
He lived; syn. عَاشَ. (S, K.) ―
-b5-  And I. q.
بَقِىَ: (TA:) one says, غَنِيتُ لَكَ مِنِّى بِالمَوَدَّةِ,
meaning بَقِيتُ [i. e. I remained, or have remained, constant to thee with my love, or affection]. (ISd, K, TA: in the CK [erroneously]
غَنَيْتُ.) ―
-b6-  [And I. q. كَانَ.] قَدْ أَغْنَى الحَبِيبَ
المُصَافِىَ, in a verse of Ibn-Mukbil, means أَكُونُ
الحَبِيبَ [i. e. Certainly I will be, or shall be, the
sincere friend]. (TA.) And غَنِيَتْ دَارُنَا تِهَامَةَ,
(K, TA,) in a verse of another poet, (TA,)
means كَانَتْ [i. e. Our place of abode was
Tihámeh]. (K, TA.) And one says of a thing
when it has perished, passed away, or come to
nought, كَأَنْ لَمْ يَغْنَ بِالأَمْسِ, meaning كَأَنْ لَمْ
يَكُنْ [i. e. As though it had not been in existence
yesterday]. (Az, TA.)
-A2-  غَنِىَ also signifies
لَقِىَ: (K:) [SM doubts this; saying,] thus in
the copies; but perhaps it should be بَقِىَ, a
signification of غَنِىَ accord. to ISd and the K
[and mentioned above]: (TA:) [it appears, however, to be correct; for it is said that] مَا غَنِيتُ
فُلَانًا means لَمْ أَلْقَهُ [i. e. I did not meet, or meet
with, or find, or I have not met, &c., such a one].
(JK.) [Accord. to the TK, غَنِىَ followed by بِهِ
signifies لَقِى: but this is perhaps said conjecturally.]
2
غَنَّىَ see 4.
-A2-  غنّى, (S, MA, Msb,) inf. n.
تَغْنِيَةٌ, (KL,) as syn. with ↓ تغنّى, (S, MA,
Msb, *) He sang, or chanted, (S, * MA, KL;) or
he trilled, or quavered, or prolonged his voice and
modulated it sweetly, singing, or chanting. (Msb
in explanation of the former.) You say غنّاهُ الشِّعْرَ
[He sang, or chanted, to him the poetry], and
غنّى بِهِ [he sang, or chanted, it, i. e., the poetry],
inf. n. تَغْنِيَةٌ; and بِهِ ↓ تغنّى; تغنّى and غنّى
having one and the same meaning. (K, TA.)
بِالقُرْآنِ ↓ يَتَغَنَّى, in a trad. cited in the first paragraph of art. اذن, means, as expl. by EshSháfi'ee, Reciting [or chanting] the Kur-án with
a plaintive and gentle voice. (Az, Msb, TA.
[See also that trad. somewhat differently related
voce تَرَنَّمَ.]) ―
-b2-  غنّى is also said of a pigeon,
meaning It [cooed, or] uttered a cry; (K, TA;)
and so ↓ تغنّى. (TA.) ―
-b3-  غنّى بِالمَرْأَةِ means
تَغَزَّلَ بِهَا, (K, TA,) i. e. He mentioned the woman
[in amatory language, as an object of love,] in
his poetry: (TA:) and غنّى بِزَيْدٍ He eulogized
Zeyd: or he satirized him: like ↓ تغنّى in these
two senses: (K, TA:) in that of eulogizing and
that of satirizing: or, in the opinion of ISd, both
of the verbs are used in these two senses and likewise in the sense mentioned immediately before
them; meaning that he did thus after prolonging
and modulating his voice; singing, or chanting,
the same, i. e. the غَزَل and the eulogy and the
satire. (TA.)
3
غَاْنَىَ see غَنَآءٌ. [From what is there said, it
seems that غاناهُ signifies He was in no need of
him, or it; like غَنِىَ عَنْهُ and استغنى عنه: compare تَغَانَوْا.
-A2-  And app. it signifies also He
spoke, or talked, to him, i. e. to a child, or boy,
saying to him what was pleasing to him; for it is
said that] المُغَانَاةُ means تَكْلِيمُكَ الصَّبِىَّ بِمَا
يَهْوَى. (JK.)
4
اغناهُ He (i. e. God, S, K, TA, [but wanting
in the CK and app. in several copies of the K,])
rendered him, or made him to be, in no need, or
free from want; (S, * MA, K; *) [or in a state
of competence, or sufficiency;] or possessed of
wealth; (S, * K, * TA;) [or rich, or wealthy;
(see 1, first sentence;)] and ↓ غنّاهُ signifies the
same; (K, TA; [but wanting in the CK and
app. in several copies of the K;]) or, as some
say, this latter is [used] in prayer [app. as meaning he said to him, May God enrich thee, or the
like: compare سَقَّيْتُهُ (“ I said to him, May God
send down rain to thee ”), and عَقَّرْتُهُ (as expl. in
art. عقر), &c.]. (TA.) [And اغناهُ عَنْ كَذَا He,
or it, caused him to be in no need, or free from
want, of such a thing. (See Ham p. 152.) And
يُغْنِى عَنْ أَنْ تَفْعَلَ كَذَا It renders needless thy
doing such a thing: lit. it causes that there shall
be no need of thy doing such a thing.] ―
-b2-  And
اغنى عَنْهُ كَذَا Such a thing sufficed him; or stood
him in stead: whence the saying in the Kur
[lxix. 28], مَا أَغْنَىعَنِّى مَالِيَهْ [My property has
not sufficed me, or stood me in stead]: and [in iii. 8
and lviii. 18 of the same,] لَنْ تُغْنِىَ عَنْهُمْ أَمْوَالُهُمْ
[Their possessions will not suffice them in lieu of
God]: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or this last means, will
not defend them from God, i. e. from his punishment. (Jel in iii. 8.) And ↓ أَغْنَيْتُ عَنْكَ مَغْنَى
فُلَانٍ and ↓ مَغْنَاتَهُ, (S, Msb, K, *) and ↓ مُغْنَى
فُلَانٍ and ↓ مُغْنَاتَهُ, (S, Mgh, K,) and فُلَانٍ ↓ غَنَآءَ,
(K,) I sufficed, or satisfied, or contented, thee, or
I have sufficed, &c., as such a one; or I stood
thee, or served thee, or I have stood &c., in the
stead of such a one. (S, * Mgh, Msb, K.) And
مَا يُغْنِى عَنْكَ هٰذَا This does not suffice, or satisfy,
or content, thee; or stand thee, or serve thee, in
any stead; and does not avail, or profit, thee.
(S.) AZ mentions مَا أَغْنَى فُلَانٌ شَيْئًا, thus, and
with ع, [i. e. أَعْنَى,] as meaning Such a one did
not avail, or profit, at all, in a difficult, or an
arduous, affair or case; and did not suffice for
such an affair or such a case, or for the supply of
what was necessary for subsistence. (Msb, TA.)
And he says also that he heard a man chide his
slave, and say to him, أَغْنِ عَنِّى وَجْهَكَ بَلْ شَرَّكَ,
meaning Free me from, and avert from me, [thy
face, nay, rather,] thy evil, or mischief: and
hence the phrase شَأْنٌ يُغْنِيهِ, [respecting which
see the second sentence in art. عنى,] in the Kur
[lxxx. 37]. (TA.) [Hence also,] وَمَا أُغْنِى عَنْكُمْ
مِنَ اللّٰهِ مِنْ شَىْءٍ, in the Kur xii. 67, means But
I do not avert from you, by my saying this, anything decreed to befall you from God: the second
من is redundant. (Jel.) And one says, أَغْنِ
عَنِّى كَذَا, meaning Put thou away from me,
and remove far from me, such a thing: properly
[أَغْنِنِى عَنْ كَذَا, originally meaning render thou
me in no need of such a thing,] a phrase of the
same kind as عَرَضَ الدَّابَّةَ عَلَى المَآءِ [for عَرَضَ
المَآءَ عَلَى الدَّابَّةِ]. (Mgh.)
-A2-  أَغْنَى عَنْهُ as intrans.: see 1, former half.
-A3-  مَا أَغْنَاهُ [How free
from wants, or how rich, or wealthy, is he!]:
this and مَا أَفْقَرَهُ are [said to be] anomalous; for
their [respective] verbs are استغنى and افتقر,
from either of which the verb of wonder may not
properly [or regularly] be formed. (S in art. فقر.
[But see غَنِىَ as syn. with استغنى; and see also
art. فقر.])
5
تَغَنَّىَ see 1, former half, in three places: ―
-b2-  and
again in the latter half:
-A2-  and see also 2, in five
places.
6
تَغَاْنَىَ see 1, former half, in two places. ―
-b2-  تَغَانُوْا
means They were, or became, free from want, one
of another, or, as we say, of one another. (S, K.)
El-Mugheereh Ibn-Habnà says,
عَنْ أَخِيهِ حَيَاتَهُ ↓ كِلَانَا غَنِىٌّ
وَنَحْنُ إِذَا مُتْنَا أَشَدُّ تَغَانِيَا
[Each of us is free from want of his brother in
his life-time; and when we die, we shall be more
free from such want]. (S.)
8
إِغْتَنَىَ see 1, second sentence.
10
إِسْتَغْنَىَ see 1, in seven places.
-A2-  استغنى اللّٰهَ He
asked, or begged, God to render him, or make him
to be, in no need, or free from want; [or in a state
of competence, or sufficiency;] or rich, or wealthy.
(K, TA. [But wanting in the CK, and app. in
several copies of the K.]) Hence the prayer, اَللّٰهُمَّ
إِنِّىَ أَسْتَغْنِيكَ عَنْ كُلِّ حَارِمٍ وَأَسْتَعِينُكَ [O God, I
ask Thee to render me in no need of any one who
refuses to give, and I beg thine aid]. (TA.)
غَنًى, (K, TA,) with fet-h, and مَقْصُور, (TA,)
i. q. مَئِنَّةٌ; so in the saying, مَكَانُ كَذَا غَنًى مِنْ
فُلَانٍ [Such a place is meet, fit, or proper, for
such a one; as though meaning a place of freedom
from want]; as also مِنْهُ ↓ مَغْنًى. (K, TA.)
غِنًى and ↓ غَنَآءٌ signify the same; (MA, K;)
both are inf. ns. of غَنِىَ: (MA:) [see the first
sentence of this art.: used as simple substs., they
mean Freedom from need or want; competence,
or sufficiency; or richness, or wealthiness:] or
غِنًى is the inf. n. of غَنِىَ; (Msb;) and ↓ غَنَآءٌ
signifies competence, or sufficiency; (Mgh, Msb;)
as in the saying, لَيْسَ عِنْدَهُ غَنَآءٌ He has not competence, or sufficiency: (Msb:) or غَنَآءٌ signifies
profit, utility, or avail; (S;) and you say, رَجُلٌ
لَا غَنَآءَ عِنْدَهُ meaning A man who is not profitable
to any one: (TA voce دَدَانٌ; [and in like manner
this phrase, occurring in the S voce دَدَانٌ, is expl.
in the PS:]) and ↓ غُنْوَةٌ signifies the same as غِنًى
in the saying لِى عَنْهُ غُنْوَةٌ [I have no need of it,
or him]: (K and TA in art. غنو:) so says Ks:
but, as ISd says, the word commonly known is
↓ غُنْيَةٌ; (TA in that art.;) which see in two
places in the former half of the first paragraph of
this art.: this last word [said in the S to be an
inf. n.] and ↓ غِنْيَةٌ and ↓ غُنْوَةٌ and ↓ غُنْيَانٌ [which
is said in the S and in one place in the K to be
an inf. n.] are substs. having one and the same
meaning [syn. with غِنًى used as a simple subst.]:
and مَا لَه عَنْهُ غِنًى [in the CK erroneously غَنًى]
and ↓ غُنْيَةٌ and ↓ غُنْيَانٌ and ↓ مَغْنًى mean [lit.
He has not freedom from need of it, or him;
and hence,] he has not any means, or way, of
separating himself from, or avoiding, it, or him;
syn. بُدٌّ: (K:) and one says عَنِ ↓ فِى النِّكَاحِ غُنْيَةٌ
السِّفَاحِ [In marriage is freedom from need of
fornication]. (A and Msb in art. سفح.) مَا
كَانَ عَنْ ظَهْرِ غِنًى, in a trad. respecting alms,
means What is over and above that which suffices
for the sustenance of the household, or family.
(TA.)
غُنْوَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in
two places.
غُنْيَةٌ and غِنْيَةٌ: see غِنًى; the former in three
places.
غُنْيَانٌ: see غِنًى, latter half, in two places.
غَنَآءٌ: see غِنًى, in two places; and see also 4,
former half. A poet says,
سَيُغْنِينِى الَّذِى أَغْنَاكَ عَنِّى
فَلَا فَقْرٌ يَدُومُ وَلَا غَنَآءُ
[He will render me free from need who has rendered thee free from need of me: for poverty will
not always continue, nor competence, or richness]:
or, as some relate it, غِنَآءُ, meaning thereby the
inf. n. of ↓ غَانَيْتُ: [see 3, above:] but it is said
that the proper reading is غَنَآءُ; because this has
no other meaning than that of غِنًى: so says ISd.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  مَا فِيهِ غَنَآءُ ذَاكَ means There is not in
him [ability for] the setting-up of that, and
strength, or power, to bear it, or carry it, or to
raise it upon his back and rise with it. (ISd,
K, TA.)
غِنَآءٌ is an inf. n. of 3. (TA, [See the next preceding paragraph.])
-A2-  Also, (TA,) [Song, or
vocal music; i. e.] an utterance of the voice with
a prolonging and a sweet modulation thereof; (K,
TA;) or a raising of the voice, and continuing it
without interruption; (Nh, TA;) [a singing, and
a chanting;] it is said in the S to be مِنَ السَّمَاعِ
[meaning that it is a sort of musical performance]: (TA:) being an utterance of the voice, its
analogical form would be with damm [i. e. غُنَآءٌ,
like حُدَادٌ &c.]: (Msb, TA:) its pl. is أَغْنِيَةٌ:
(MA:) [and ↓ مَغْنًى signifies the same as غِنَآءٌ;
and a mode of singing; and any particular air,
or tune; and a song, i. e. a composition in verse
that is sung or to be sung: and its pl. is مَغَانٍ:
but perhaps it is post-classical: the pl. occurs in
the K, in art. نصب:] غِنَآءٌ [also] signifies [a song,
i. e.] poetry, or verse, that is [sung, or chanted,
or] uttered with a trilling, or quavering, or a prolonging and a sweet modulation, of the voice; (Har
p. 286;) and ↓ أُغْنِيَّةٌ is syn. with غِنَآءٌ (S, Har) in
this sense; (Har;) or, as also ↓ إِغْنِيَّةٌ, (Fr, K,
TA,) and ↓ each of them also without teshdeed,
(K, TA,) as mentioned by ISd, but said by him
to be not of valid authority, (TA,) signifies a
certain sort of غِنَآء (K, TA) which they sing or
chant: (TA:) and the pl. is أَغَانِىُّ (S, TA) [and
أَغَانٍ, this latter being the pl. of each sing. that is
without teshdeed]. ―
-b2-  الغِنَآء is also used by a poet
in the place of an inf. n., meaning التَّغَنِّى: he
says,
تَغَنِّ بِالشِّعْرِ إِمَّا كُنْتَ قَائِلَهُ
إِنَّ الغِنَآءَ بهٰذَا الشِعْرِ مِضْمَارُ
[Sing thou, or chant thou, the poetry, if thou be
uttering it: verily the singing, or chanting, this
poetry is a مضمار (expl. in art. ضمر)]. (TA.)
غَنِىٌّ and ↓ غَانٍ: see 1, former half; each in
two places: both signify [Free from want; or
in a state of competence, or sufficiency; or rich,
or wealthy; or] possessing much property or
wealth: (K, * TA:) pl. of the former أَغْنِيَآءُ.
(Msb, TA.) See an ex. of the former in a verse
cited above, conj. 6. One says, أَنَا غَنِىٌّ بِكَذَا عَنْ
غَيْرِهِ [I am sufficed by such a thing, or satisfied,
or content, with it, so as to be free from want of
another thing]. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  الغَنِىُّ as a name of
God signifies [The Self-sufficient; i. e.] He who
has no need of any one in any thing. (TA.)
غَنَّآءٌ A singer; (MA;) [as also ↓ مُغَنٍّ; and
مُغَنِّيَةٌ a female singer, a songstress:] accord. to
Ibn-Ya'eesh, a ↓ مُغَنٍّ is thus called لِأَنَّهُ يُغَنِّنُ
صَوْتَهُ, i. e. because he makes his voice to have in
it a غُنَّة [or sort of nasal sound, or twang]; the
word being, in his opinion, originally, مُغَنِّنٌ,
with three ن, the last of which is changed into
ى, when one says المُغَنِّى, for the purpose of
alleviating the utterance. (Mughnee, art. حَرْفُ
النُّونِ.)
غَانٍ: see غَنِىٌّ. ―
-b2-  [The fem.] غَانِيَةٌ signifies
A young woman who is sufficed by her husband;
or satisfied, or content, with him, (S, Msb, TA, *)
so as to be in no need, or free from want, of any
other: (Msb:) and sometimes, also, applied to a
woman, (S,) such as is sufficed by her beauty, (S,
ISd, K, TA,) so as to be in no need of decoration
(ISd, K, TA) with women's ornaments: (ISd,
TA:) or such as is sought, or desired, by men,
but does not seek, or desire: (ISd, K, * TA:) or
such as has abode in the house, or tent, of her
father and mother, and whom captivity (سِبَآء)
has not befallen; (IJ, ISd, K, * TA;) which is
the strangest of the explanations: (TA:) or such
as is youthful and chaste, whether having a husband or not: (ISd, K, TA:) or, accord. to AO,
one that is married: (Ham p. 226:) or, accord.
to Az, such as pleases men, and is pleased by شَبَاب
[which means both youthfulness and youths or
young men]: (TA:) pl. غَوَانٍ; (K;) with the
article, الغَوَانِى; [and also غَانِيَاتٌ: (see an ex. in
a verse cited in the second paragraph of art. زج:)]
in the saying of Ibn-Er-Rukeiyát,
لَا بَارَكَ اللّٰهُ فِى الغَوَانِىِ هَلْ
يُصْبِحْنَ إِلَّا لَهُنَّ مُطَّلَبُ
[May God not bless those young women that are
sufficed by their husbands, or by their beauty, &c.:
do they enter upon the time of dawn without their
having desire (lit. a time or place, meaning an
occasion, of seeking, or desire) ?], the ى is made
movent by a poetic license: (S, TA:) and another
poet uses الغَوَانِ for الغَوَانِى. (TA.)
أَغْنَآءٌ [a pl. of which the sing. is not mentioned,]
The أَمْلَاكَات [meaning Goods and chattels, or
paraphernalia,] of brides. (Az, K.)
أُغْنِيَّةٌ and إِغْنِيَّةٌ, and each of them also without
teshdeed: see غِنَآءٌ, latter half.
مَغْنًى: see 4, former half: ―
-b2-  and غَنًى: ―
-b3-
and غِنًى, near the end. ―
-b4-  Also A place in which
were its occupants, or inhabitants: (S:) or a place
of abode by which its occupants, or inhabitants,
were sufficed, or with which they were satisfied, or
content, and from which they then departed, or
removed: or in a general sense; (K, TA;) a place
of abode, absolutely; but this seems to be a distinct application: (TA:) pl. مَغَانٍ; with the
