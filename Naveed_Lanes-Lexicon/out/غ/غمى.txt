-b2-  One says also,
أُغْمِىَ عَلَيْهِ الخَبَرُ The information, or narration,
was dubious, confused, or vague, to him; such as
was difficult to be understood; or such as was not
to be understood; like غُمَّ: (S:) or was obscure,
or unapparent, to him. (Msb.) ―
-b3-  And أُغْمِىَ
عَلَيْهِ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) inf. n. إِغْمَآءٌ; (Mgh,
Msb;) and عليه ↓ غُمِىَ; (S, Msb, K;) said of a
sick man, (S, Msb, K,) He swooned, i. e. became
senseless, (غُشِىَ عَلَيْهِ, S, * K,) and then recovered
his senses: (K:) or إِغْمَآءٌ is a weakness of the
faculties by reason of the overpowering effect of
disease: (Mgh:) or it is an abstraction, or
absence of mind, that overtakes a man, with
languor of the limbs, or members, or organs, by
reason of a malady; (Mgh, Msb;) thus it is
defined by the scholastic theologians; and is the
same as غُشْىٌ: (Mgh:) or it is a repletion of the
venters of the brain with a cold, thick, phlegm;
(Mgh, Msb;) thus accord. to the physicians, who
distinguish between it and غُشْىٌ, as do the lawyers: (Mgh:) [see also غُشِىَ عَلَيْهِ:] the patient
is said to be عَلَيْهِ ↓ مُغْمًى, (S, Mgh, and so in
some copies of the K,) and عَلَيْهِ ↓ مَغْمِىٌّ, (S, Msb,
and so in some copies of the K,) and ↓ غَمًى, which
last epithet is applied to a single person, (S, K,)
and to two persons, (S,) and to a pl. number, (S,
K,) and to a female [as well as a male], (S,) or
(if you will, S) you say هُمَا غَمَيَانِ and هُمْ أَغْمَآءٌ.
(S, K.)
فِى السَّمَآءِ غَمْىٌ, (K,) or كَانَ عَلَى السَّمَآءِ غَمْىٌ,
(Msb,) and ↓ غَمًى, (Msb, K,) mean [Upon the
sky is, or was,] what veiled, or concealed, the new
moon: (Msb, K:) not from غُمَّ: (K:) this addition in the K is meant as an indirect slur upon
J, for his having mentioned [in this art.] the
statement of Fr that one says صُمْنَا لِلْغُمَّى and
لِلْغَمَّى, meaning We fasted when the new moon
was veiled, or concealed, to us; and هِىَ لَيْلَةُ الغَمَّى
[or الغُمَّى]; the [proper] place of which is [the
section of words whereof the last radical is] م:
(TA:) [see غَمٌّ, in that art.: but accord. to Fei,]
one says [also], ↓ صُمْنَا لِلْغُمْيَةِ. (Msb. [It is
there added that this noun is like مُدْيَة in
measure: otherwise I should think that the right
reading is لِلْغُمِّيَّة, which has been mentioned voce
غَمٌّ.])
غَمًى and ↓ غِمَآءٌ (T, S, K) The roof of a house,
or chamber: (T, K:) or the covering of the roof,
(S, K,) consisting of earth &c., (K,) or consisting
of reeds, or canes, and earth, and the like; (S;)
and غَمًا also signifies [the same, or] the covering
of a house, or chamber, consisting of clay, or
earth, and wood: (TA in art. غمو:) the dual [of
the first and last] is غَمَيَانِ and غَمَوَانِ: and the
pl. is أَغْمَآءٌ, (K, TA,) which is [of the same] like
أَنْقَآءٌ pl. of نَقًى [and نَقًا], (TA,) and أَغْمِيَةٌ, (K,
TA,) which is of ↓ غِمَآءٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also, the
first, [in the CK, erroneously, غَماء,] A covering
that is put upon a horse in order that he may
sweat. (ISd, K.) ―
