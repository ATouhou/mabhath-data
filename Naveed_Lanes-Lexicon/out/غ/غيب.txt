غيب1
غَابَ, (S, O, Mgh, Msb, TA,) aor. يَغِيبُ,
(Msb,) inf. n. غَيْبَةٌ [the most common form] (S,
O, Mgh, Msb, K) and غَيْبٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and
غَيَابٌ, (S, O,) or غِيَابٌ, (Msb, K,) and غُيُوبٌ (S,
O, Msb, K) and غُيُوبَةٌ (O, K) and غَيْبُوبَةٌ, (O,
K,) accord. to some of the measure فَعْلُولَةٌ, but
accord. to others of the measure فَيْعَلُولَةٌ i. e. originally غَيَّبُوبَةٌ, (MF,) and مَغِيبٌ (S, O, Msb, K)
and مَغَابٌ; (K;) and ↓ تغيّب; (Msb, K;) He,
or it, was, or became, absent; غَابَ being the contr.
of حَضَرَ; (S and K in art. حضر;) or distant, or
remote; (Mgh;) or hidden, concealed, or unapparent; (TA;) [or absent from the range, or
beyond the reach, of perception by sense, or of
mental perception: see غَيْبٌ.] You say, غاب عَنْهُ,
inf. n. غَيْبَةٌ (S, Mgh, TA) &c., as above, (S, TA,)
He, or it, was, or became, [absent from him; or]
distant, or remote, from him; (Mgh;) or hidden,
or concealed, from him; [&c.;] as also ↓ تغيّب.
(TA.) And أَوْحَشَتْنِى غَيْبَةُ فُلَانٍ [The absence of
such a one has made me to feel lonely]: and أَطَلْتَ
غَيْبَتَكَ [Thou hast made thine absence to be long].
(A.) And ↓ أَنَا مَعَكُمْ لَا أُغَايِبُكُمْ [I am with you:
I will not be absent from you]. (A.) And بَنُو
أَحْيَانًا ↓ فُلَانٍ يَشْهَدُونَ أَحْيَانًا وَيَتَغَايَبُونَ (ISk, S,
TA) i. e. [The sons of such a one are present sometimes] and are absent (يَغِيبُونَ) sometimes: but
one does not say ↓ يَتَغَيَّبُونَ [unless with عَنْ following it]: (TA:) [it seems, however, that
يتغيّبون, here, is a mistranscription for يَتَغَيَّبُونَنَا
or the like; for] one says, عَنِّى فُلَانٌ ↓ تغيّب
[Such a one was, or became, absent from me; or
absented himself from me]; (S, K, * TA;) and
↓ تَغَيَّبَنِى also in a case of necessity in verse, (S,
K, TA,) but not in any other case, (K, TA,)
accord. to the generality of authorities except the
Koofees: (TA:) Imra-el-Keys says,
فَظَلَّ لَنَا يَوْمٌ لَذِيذٌ بِنَعْمَةٍ
فَقُلْ فِى مَقِيلٍ نَحْسُهُ مُتَغَيِّبِى
[thus in my copies of the S and in the TA; but
we should read مُتَغَيِّبِ, whether it mean مُتَغَيِّبِى
or not, as is shown by what follows: the verse
may be rendered, So a delightful day, with ease
and comfort, betided us: and say thou, of a place
of midday-sleep whereof the ill luck was absent
from me,. . .]: but Fr says that the word
متغيّب is marfooa, [i. e. that the right reading is
مُتَغَيِّبُ, meaning simply absent,] that the verse is
مُكْفَأ [or made faulty in the termination], and that
it is not allowable to make that word refer to
مَقِيلٍ, like as it is not allowable to say مَرَرْتُ
بِرَجُلٍ أَبُوهُ قَائِمٍ. (S, TA. [One might be tempted
to suppose that we should read فَقِلْ; but this
would not suit the context, which see in Ahlwardt's “ Divans of the six ancient Arabic poets,”
p. 119.]) ―
-b2-  [غاب, inf. n. غَيْبَةٌ, is also said of the
mind (القَلْب), meaning (assumed tropical:)  It was, or became,
absent. The inf. n. (غَيْبَةٌ) is often used as meaning (assumed tropical:)  Absence of mind; and particularly, from
self and others by its being exclusively occupied by
the contemplation of divine things: see an ex. voce
شَوًى; and another voce سَكِينَةٌ.] ―
-b3-  مَا غَابَ عَنْهُ
ابْنُ أَبِى قُحَافَةَ (assumed tropical:)  [Ibn-Abee-Koháfeh was not a

occurs in a trad. respecting a satirical saying of
Hassán against [the tribe of] Kureysh; meaning
that Aboo-Bekr [the son of Aboo-Koháfeh] was
skilled in genealogies and traditions, and that it
was he who instructed Hassán. (TA.) ―

letter or letters, or by a messenger or messengers.]

8
اغتابهُ [He spoke evil of him; or did so in
his absence, i. e. backbit him; (the latter being
obviously the primary signification;) not always,
though generally, meaning with truth:] he spoke
evil of him in his absence; (TA;) or said of him,
in his absence, what would grieve him (S, TA) if
he heard it; (S;) with truth: (S, TA:) he carped
at him behind the back, or in absence, by saying
what would grieve him, (بِمَا ↓ تَنَاوَلَهُ بِظَهْرِ الغَيْبِ
يَسُوؤُهُ,) of what was [reprehensible] in him: (TA:)
or he spoke of him imputing to him what he disliked, of vices, or faults, with truth: (Msb:)
when the charge is false, it is termed بُهْتَانٌ: (S,
Msb, TA:) or he attributed, or imputed, to him
a vice, or fault, or the like; and mentioned him
with what was in him of evil; (K, TA;) or said
of him what would grieve him: (TA:) and ↓ غَابَهُ
signifies the same: (K, TA:) [so does ↓ غيّبهُ:
(see Ksh in civ. 1:) that اغتابهُ does not always
signify he spoke evil of him, or the like, in his
absence, appears from several instances, such as
the phrases المُغْتَابُ فِى الوَجْهِ (K in art. لمز) and
المُغْتَابُونَ بِالحَضْرَةِ (IAar, TA in that art.): nor
does it always signify he spoke evil of him, or the
like, with truth; for the verb is used in the Ksh
and by Bd and Jel in civ. 1 having for its object
the Prophet:] IAar says that ↓ غاب is syn. with
اغتاب, and signifies he mentioned a man with the
imputation of good or of evil. (TA.) [It may
also mean He expressed, or signified, an evil
opinion of him by making signs with the side of
the mouth, or with the eye, or with the head, or
otherwise; as is indicated in the TA in arts. لمز
and همز.]
غَابٌ: see غَابَةٌ, in three places.
غَيْبٌ Whatever is absent, or hidden, from one;
(S, A, Msb, K, TA;) as though it were an inf. n.
used in the sense of the act. part. n. [in which the
meaning of a subst. is predominant]; (TA;) and
so ↓ غَائِبٌ, which [in this sense] is a subst., like
كَاهِلٌ, (K, TA,) or an act. part. n. used in the
sense of a subst.: (MF:) anything that is absent,
or hidden, from the eyes; invisible, unseen, or unapparent; whether it be, or be not, perceived in
the heart, or mind: (IAar, TA:) [or anything
unperceivable; absent from the range, or beyond
the reach, of perception by sense, or of mental
perception; or undiscoverable unless by means of
divine revelation; a mystery, or secret, such as an
event of futurity;] a thing that has been hidden
from men, and with which the Prophet has
acquainted them, of the events of the resurrection
and of Paradise and of Hell &c.; thus in the
Kur ii. 2; (Zj, TA;) and [hence] Zj explains
الغَيْب as meaning, in the Kur lxxxi. 24, that
which has been revealed: (TA in art. ضن:) pl.
غُيُوبٌ. (Msb.) [See also the Ksh and Bd in ii. 2.]
[Hence, عَالَمُ الغَيْبِ The world of the unseen; the
invisible world.] And [hence also] one says, رَجَمَ
بِالغَيْبِ [and قَذَفَ بِالغَيْبِ (see art. قذف)] He
spoke of that which he did not know: (Ham
p. 494:) and قَالَ رَجْمًا بِالغَيْبِ He said conjecturally, [or speaking of that which was hidden
from him or unknown by him,] without evidence,
and without proof. (Msb in art. رجم, q. v.) ―
-b2-
And (assumed tropical:)  Doubt, or a doubting: (K:) but some disapprove this: some regard it as tropical: and
some pronounce it correct: (MF, TA:) pl. غِيَابٌ
and غُيُوبٌ. (K.) A poet says,
أَنْتَ نَبِىٌّ تَعْلَمُ الغِيَابَا
لَا قَائِلًا إِفْكًا وَلَا مُرْتَابَا
[Thou art a prophet, knowing doubts, or things
doubted; not saying a lie, nor a thing suspected:
or, more probably, the meaning is, the things
unseen]. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Also A place, in the ground,
that hides, or conceals, one: (TA:) a low, or
depressed, place in the ground, or in a tract of
land: (S, K, TA:) or any place such that one
knows not what is in it: and a place such that one
knows not what is behind it: (Sh, TA:) pl. غُيُوبٌ.
(TA.) Hence the phrase عَنْ ظَهْرِ غَيْبٍ in a verse
of Lebeed cited voce ظَهْرٌ, q. v. (TA.) [Hence
also] one says, سَمِعْتُ صَوْتًا مِنْ وَرَآءِ الغَيْبِ i. e.
[I heard a sound, or voice,] from [behind] a
place that I saw not. (A, TA.) And تَنَاوَلَهُ
بِظَهْرِ الغَيْبِ بِمَا يَسُوؤُهُ: see 8. And تَكَلَّمَ بِهِ عَنْ
ظَهْرِ غَيْبٍ (A) or عَنْ ظَهْرِ الغَيْبِ (TA, and A and
O in art. ظهر) [app. He spoke of it by memory;
in the absence of a book or the like; as one says
in modern Arabic, عَلَى الغَائِب. See also ظَهْرٌ.]
―
-b4-  Also The خَمْصَة [i. e. pit, or depression, as is
shown by what here follows, (thus in the A, and
in the Ksh in ii. 2, in the TA حُفْرَة, which has a
similar meaning,)] that is in the place where the
kidney is situate, (Ksh, A, TA,) and which swells
up when the beast becomes big in the belly: so says
ISh: (Ksh ubi suprà:) or the خَمْصَة that is next
to the kidney: (Bd in ii. 2: [De Sacy doubted
respecting its meaning, but conjectured that it
might be thus: see his Anthol. Gramm. Arabe
p. 55:]) pl. غُيُوبٌ: one says, شَرِبَتِ الدَّابَّةُ حَتَّى
وَارَتْ غُيُوبَ كُلَاهَا, (ISh, Ksh ubi suprà, A, TA,)
meaning هُزُومَهَا [i. e. The beast drank until it concealed the pits of its kidneys]. (A, TA.) ―
-b5-  And
Fat: (K, TA:) i. e. the fat of the ثَرْب [q. v.] of
a sheep or goat: so called because it is hidden
from the eye. (TA.)
-A2-  See also غَائِبٌ.
غَيَبٌ: see غَائِبٌ, in two places.
غَابَةٌ is originally [غَيَبَةٌ] of the measure فَعَلَةٌ,
with fet-h to the ع. (Msb.) It signifies A low,
or depressed, place, or a hollow in the ground,
(El-Hawázinee, K, TA,) before which, or in the
way to which, (دُونَهَا,) is an eminence. (El-Hawá-
zinee, TA.) ―
-b2-  And (K) i. q. أَجَمَةٌ: (S, K, TA:)
[i. e.] A bed of canes or reeds: (AHn, Msb, TA:)
and [a thicket, wood, or forest; like أَجَمَةٌ;] a
collection of trees, (AHn, ISd, TA,) densely disposed; so called because it conceals what is in it:
(ISd, TA:) or a tall أَجَمَة, having high, or very
high, extremities [app. to its canes or reeds]:
(TA:) pl. غَابَاتٌ (Msb, TA) and [coll. gen. n.]
↓ غَابٌ. (S, Msb, TA.) ―
-b3-  And (assumed tropical:)  A long spear
(K, TA) that has extremities like those of the أَجَمَة
[expl. above]: (TA:) [but I think that this addition in the TA correctly applies to غَابَةٌ signifying
a number of spears, like a bed of canes or reeds, or
like a forest; agreeably with two of the explanations here following:] or a spear that quivers in
the wind: (K, TA:) or (tropical:)  numerous spears, like
abundant and dense trees: (A:) or an assemblage
of spears; app. so called as being likened to a
غابة meaning an أَجَمَة of dense trees: (ISd, TA:)
pl. غَابَات and [coll. gen. n.] ↓ غَابٌ. (TA.) One
says, أَتَوْنَا فِى غَابَةٍ i. e. (tropical:)  [They came to us] amid
numerous spears, like abundant and dense trees:
(A:) or غابة may be used in this case in the
sense here following. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And A company,
or congregated body, of men: (Aboo-Jábir ElAsadee, K, TA:) pl. غَابَاتٌ and [coll. gen. n.]
↓ غَابٌ. (TA.)
غَيْبَةٌ an inf. n. [See 1, in several places.] ―
-b2-
Also, and ↓ غَيَابَةٌ, A low, or depressed, piece of
land or ground: so in the phrases وَقَعْنَا فِى غَيْبَةٍ
and غَيَابَةٍ [app. meaning We lighted upon a low,
or depressed, piece &c.; or perhaps the meaning
may be we fell into &c.]. (S.) ―
-b3-  See also غَيَابَةٌ.
غِيبَةٌ the subst. from اِغْتَابَهُ: (Msb:) it signifies
[Evil speech respecting a person; or such speech
in his absence; not always, though generally,
meaning with truth:] evil speech respecting a
person in his absence; (TA;) or a saying of him,
in his absence, what would grieve him (S, TA) if
he heard it; (S;) with truth: (S, TA:) or speech
respecting a person imputing to him what he dislikes, of vices, or faults, with truth: (Msb:) when
it is false, it is termed بُهْتَانٌ: (S, Msb, TA:) or
an imputing to a person a vice, or fault, or the
like; and a mentioning him with what is in him
of evil; (K, TA;) or a saying of him what
would grieve him: (TA:) or it may be speech
imputing good or evil. (K, * TA.)
غَيِبَانٌ or غَيْبَانٌ, [accord. to different copies of
the K, between which the TA does not enable us
to decide with certainty, as it only states, with
respect to the ى, that it is مُخَفَّفَة, which may
mean either the contr. of doubled or the contr. of
movent, though the former is the more general
meaning, (in the TA it is said to be erroneously
written in a copy of the K with a final ت instead
of ن,)] and ↓ غَيِّبَانٌ, The roots of trees, (K, TA,)
that are hidden from view: or, accord. to AHn,
the غيبان and ↓ غيّبان and ↓ غَيَابَة, of plants, or
herbage, are, with the Arabs, what the sun has
not shone upon: and accord. to Aboo-Ziyád ElKilábee, the غيبان and ↓ غيّبان of plants, or
herbage, and also of their roots, are what is con-
cealed from the sun, so as to be not shone upon by
it. (L, TA.)
غَيِّبَانٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in
three places.
غَيَابٌ A thing that hides, or conceals, a thing
from one: (Meyd:) and hence, (Meyd, TA,) a
grave; (S, Meyd, TA;) and so ↓ غَيَابَةٌ: (TA:)
one says, غَيَابُهُ ↓ غَيَّبَهُ (S, Meyd, TA) and ↓ غَيَابَتُهُ
(TA) meaning دُفِنَ فِى قَبْرِهِ (S, Meyd, TA) [i. e.
May he be buried in his grave]: an imprecation
of death against the man. (Meyd.)
غَيَابَةٌ The part of anything that veils, or conceals, one. (K.) And hence, (K,) The bottom of
a جُبّ [or well]; (S, K, * TA;) or this, accord.
to some, is the primary signification; as also
↓ غَيْبَةٌ, accord. to one reading, in the Kur xii. 10;
(TA;) [and غَيَايَةٌ;] and of a valley; (S, TA;)
&c.: (TA:) pl. غَيَابَاتٌ. (K, TA.) [And A covert,
or place of concealment, of birds. (See ظِلَالَةٌ.)]

غَائِبٌ act. part. n. of 1 [signifying Absent; distant, or remote; and hidden, concealed, or unapparent; or absent from the range, or beyond
the reach, of perception by sense, or of mental
perception]: pl. (applied to men, K, TA) غُيَّبٌ
and غُيَّابٌ (S, Msb, K) and غَائِبُونَ (K) and
↓ غَيَبٌ, (S, Mgh, K,) or rather the last is a
quasi-pl. n., (TA,) and ↓ غَيْبٌ, [which is also
properly speaking a quasi-pl. n.,] like صَحْبٌ:
(Msb [in which غَيَبٌ is not mentioned]:) the ى
in ↓ غَيَبٌ remains unchanged, notwithstanding the
two fet-hahs, because it is likened to صَيَدٌ, and,
although it is a pl. [in signification] and صَيَدٌ is
an inf. n., it may be used as meant for an inf. n.
(S, TA.) ―
-b2-  See also غَيْبٌ, first sentence. ―
