the upper part [of each] of the two ears, upon, or
over, the concha thereof, by reason of its width
and its largeness: (TA:) Aboo-'Amr Esh-Sheybánee says, after citing a verse of Abu-n-Nejm,
describing a lion, that it signifies a twisting, in
the ear, backwards: accord. to ISh, it is, in the
lion, a laxness, or pendulousness, of the upper eyelids, upon the eyes; arising from anger and pride:
(O:) and he says that, accord. to some, it is, in
the lion, abundance of the fur, and a folding, or
creasing, of the skin. (TA.) And one says, [app.
in relation to the lion,] ↓ فِى أَشْفَارِهِ غَضْفٌ and

resembling the palm-tree exactly, (O, L, TA,) but
not growing tall, (TA,) having many سَعَف, and
prickles, and [leaves such as are termed] خُوص,
of the hardest sort, whereof are made large [receptacles of the kind called] جِلَال [pl. of جُلَّةٌ],
that serve for sacks, goods being carried in them

though an obvious mistake, Freytag asserts to be
the right reading and explanation.])
