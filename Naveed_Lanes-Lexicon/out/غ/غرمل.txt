غرملغُرْمُولٌ The penis, (S, O, K,) in an absolute
sense: (TA:) or a large and flaccid penis before
its prepuce is cut off; (K;) thus says AZ: (TA:)
or it is said to be of a solid-hoofed animal: but
mention is made in a trad. of the غَرَامِيل of men
[in relation to whom, however, it may perhaps be
used in this instance by way of comparison].
(TA.)
