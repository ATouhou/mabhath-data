-b2-  And accord.
to ISd, The web of the spider. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And
غَزْلُ النَبَاتِ is applied in Egypt to The sort of food
called إِطْرِيَة. (TA in art. طرو, q. v.)
غِزْلُ نِسَآءٍ A follower and lover of women; as
also نِسَآءٍ ↓ غِزِّيلُ: (JK:) [or both may be rendered one who talks, and acts in an amatory and
enticing manner; or who plays, sports, dallies, or
wantons, and holds amorous talk; with women:]
↓ غِزِّيلٌ is of the measure فِعِّيلٌ in the sense of the
measure مُفَاعِلٌ; like حِدِّيثٌ and كِلِّيمٌ. (TA.)
غَزَلٌ, as expl. by 'Abd-El-Muttalib El-Baghdádee, in his Exposition of the نَقْدُ الشِعْرِ of
Kudámeh, signifies The talk, and actions, and
circumstances, occurring between the lover and the
object of love; differing somewhat from تَشْبِيبٌ,
which is a celebrating of the person and qualities
of the beloved; and from نَسِيبٌ, which is a mentioning of the state, or condition, of the نَاسِب
[himself], and of the object of the نَسِيب, and of
all the affairs, or events, occurring between them
two, [in the prelude of an ode,] thus including
the meaning of تَشْبِيبٌ, and being a mentioning of
غَزَل: accord. to Kudámeh, it signifies an inclining to foolish and youthful conduct, or a manifesting of passionate love, and becoming notorious
for affections to women: (TA:) or it is the subst.
from 3 [as such signifying talk, and amatory and
enticing conduct, with women; or play, sport, dalliance, or wanton conduct, and amorous talk, with
women]; (S, K;) as also ↓ مَغْزَلٌ: (K:) or play,
sport, or diversion, with women: (ISd, TA:) or
the talk of young men and [or with] young women:
(Msb:) or, accord. to the leading authorities in
polite literature, and those who have made the
language to be their study, [or rather accord. to
a loose and post-classical usage,] it signifies, like
نَسِيبٌ, praise of what are apparent of the menbers of the object of love: or the mention of the
days of union and of disunion: or the like thereof.
(MF.)
غَزِلٌ [is, by, rule, the part. n. of غَزِلَ, as such
signifying Talking, and acting in an amatory and
enticing manner, with a woman, or with women;
&c.: but it is said that it] signifies صَاحِبُ غَزَلٍ;
(S, O;) or مُتَغَزِّلٌ بِالنِّسَآءِ; (K, TA;) by which is
here meant making mention, or speaking, or one
who makes mention, or who speaks, [generally in
verse,] of what is termed غَزَل [signifying as expl.
above, i. e. the talk, and actions, and circumstances, occurring between the lover and the object
of love; &c.]; thus used as being a possessive
epithet, [not as a part. n. of غَزِلَ, because this
differs in meaning from تَغَزَّلَ,] i. e. it signifies
[properly] ذُوغَزَلٍ: (TA:) or it means displaying
amorous gestures or behaviour, and foolish and
youthful conduct such as is suitable to women, with
the love, or passionate love, that he experiences
for them, in order that they may incline to him:
(Kudámeh, TA:) or it is applied to a man as
meaning a companion of women because of his
lacking strength to be otherwise: from what here
follows. (IAar, TA.) ―
-b2-  Lacking strength, or
ability, to perform, or accomplish, things; (IAar,
K, TA;) remiss, or languid, in respect to them.
(IAar, TA.)

the rel. n. from غَزْلٌ used as a subst. (Msb.)
غَزَالٌ A young gazelle, وَلَدُ ظَبْيَةٍ: (Msb:) or a
شَادِن [or young gazelle], (T, S, O, Msb, K, TA,)
or, as some say, the female, (TA, [but see what
follows,]) when it becomes active, or in motion,
(T, S, O, Msb, K, TA.) and walks; (T, Msb,
K, TA;) to which the girl, or young woman, is
likened in [the commencing of an ode by what is
termed] التَّشْبِيب, wherefore the epithet and the
verb [therein] are made mase.; (TA;) after the
becoming a ثَنِىّ [q. v.]: (T, Msb:) or in the stage
after that in which he is termed طَلًا [q. v.]:
(AHát, Msb, TA:) or from the time of his birth
until he attains to the most vehement running;
(K, TA;) which is when he puts his legs together,
[app. meaning his fore legs together and so his
hind legs,] and puts them down together and raises
them together: (TA:) or i. q. ظَبْىٌ [i. e. a gazelle,
of any age]: (M in art. ظبى: for الظَّبْىُ is there
expl. as meaning الغَزَالُ: [but this seems to be a
loose rendering:]) the female is called ↓ غَزَالَةٌ;
(Msb, MF, TA;) though it seems from what is
said in the K [&c.] that الغَزَالُ is applied peculiarly to the male, and that the female is called
only ظَبْيَةٌ, as several of the lexicologists have
decisively asserted: (MF, TA:) the pl. [of pane.]
is غِزْلَةٌ and [of mult.] غِزْلانٌ. (S, O, Msb, K.)
-A2-
غَزَالُ شَعْبَانَ A certain insect (دُوَيْبَّةٌ), (K, TA,) a
species of the [locusts, or locust-like insects, called]
جَنَادِب [pl. of جُنْدَبٌ]. (TA.)

certain plant, resembling the طَرْخُون [or tarragon],
(O, K,) which is eaten, (O,) burning, or biting,
to the tongue, (O, K,) green, and having a red
root, like the roots of the أَرْطَاة [n. un. of أَرْطًى,
q. v.], (O,) with the juice of which girls, or young
women, make red streaks like bracelets upon their
arms: (O, K:) thus AHn was informed by some
one or more of the Benoo-Asad: (O:) and Aboo-Nasr says, it is of the [kind called] ذُكُور. [See
also دَمُ الغَزَالِ and دَمُ الغِزْلَانِ and دُمْيَةُ الغِزْلَانِ
voce دمٌ in art. دمو or دمى; and see likewise
عَنْدَمٌ.]
غَزَالَةٌ fem. of غَزَالٌ, q. v.
-A2-  الغَزَالَةُ, also, signifies The sun; (S, O, K;) because it extends
[what resemble] cords, [meaning its rays,] as
though it were spinning: (K:) or the sun when
rising; (Msb, K;) [therefore] one says طَلَعَتِ
الغَزَالَةُ, but not غَرَبَتِ الغَزَالَةُ: (TA:) or the sun
when high: (M, * K, TA:) or the عَيْن [meaning
the disk, or, as it sometimes means, the rays, or
beams,] of the sun. (K.) ―
-b2-  And غَزَالَةُ الضُّحَى
means, (S, O, K,) as also غَزَالَاتُهُ, (K,) [or غَزَالَاتُهَا,]
The beginning of the ضُحَى [or early part of the
forenoon, after sunrise]; (S, O, K;) [whence]
one says, جَآءَ فِى غَزَالَةِ الضُّحَى [He came in the
beginning of the ضُحَى]; and Dhu-r-Rummeh uses
الغَزَالَةَ, in the accus. case, as an adv. n., (S, O,)
meaning in the time [or in the beginning] of the
ضُحَى; (O;) or, accord. to IKh, this is for طُلُوعَ
الغَزَالَةِ, meaning at the rising of the sun: (TA:)
or the meaning of the phrases first mentioned in
this sentence is after, or a little after, (accord. to
different copies of the K,) the spreading of the
son, [i. e. of the sunshine,] and its entrance upon
the ضُحَى: or the first part of the ضُحَى, until
the passing away of a fifth (or about a fifth, TA)
of the day. (K.)
-A3-  Also (i. e. الغَزَالَةُ) A certain
herb, (Aboo-Nasr. O, K,) of the [kind called]
سُطَّاح, spreading upon the ground, with green
leaves, having no thorns nor broaches; from the
middle whereof comes forth a tall قَضِيب [or
shoot], which is peeled and eaten, (Aboo-Nasr,
O,) and it is sweet, (Aboo-Nasr, O, K,) and has
yellow blossoms from its bottom to its top: and it
is a pasture: (Aboo-Nasr, O:) every thing [i. e.
animal] eats it: (Aboo-Nasr, O, K;) and the
places of its growth are the plain, or soft, tracts.
(Aboo-Nasr, O)
غَزَّالٌ A vender [and a spinner] of غَزْل [i. e.
thread,. or gave]. (TA.)
غِزِّيلٌ; see غِزْلُ نِسَآءٍ, in two places.
غَازِلٌ [act. part. n. of غَزَلَ; Spinning]. The
pls. غُزَّلٌ and غَوَازِلُ are applied as epithets to
women: (K, TA:) but the former is also applied
to men, and is of a measure more usual as that
of the pl. of the mase. act. part. n. than of the
fem. (TA.)
أَغْزَلُ مِنْ عَنْكَبُوتٍ, from the act of spinning,
(Meyd,) or from the act of weaving [the web],
(O.) is a prov. [meaning More practised, or
skilled, in weaving than a spider]: and so مِنْ
سُرْفَةٍ [than a سُرْفَة, q. v.]. (Meyd.) ―
-b2-  And one
says also, أَغْزَلُ مِنِ امْرِئِ القَيْسِ, (S, Meyd, O,)
likewise a prov., meaning [More practised, or
skilled,] in the celebrating of the person and qualities of the beloved in verse [than Imra-el-Keys].
(Meyd.) ―
-b3-  And [hence,] أَغْزَلُ مِنَ الحُمَّى
(assumed tropical:)  [More frequent in visiting, or more habitual,
and more recurrent, than the fever]; a saying of
the Arabs, by which they mean that it [the fever]
is a frequent visiter of the sick person, recurrent
to him; as though passionately loving him: thus,
correctly, as in the L: in the K it is said that
الأَغْزَلُ applied to the fever (الحُمَّى [though this
is fem.]) means such as is a frequent visiter of
the sick person; recurrent. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And أَغْزَلُ
مِنْ فُرْعُلٍ [More confounded and perplexed than
a young one of the hyena]; from الغَزَلُ as signifying “ the being confounded and perplexed ” like
as is the dog (Meyd, O, K) when pursuing the
young gazelle; for it may be that the فرعل
becomes in the like state in pursuing the object
of its chase: (Meyd:) or فرعل was a man of
ancient times, and this saying (which is a prov.,
Meyd) is like أَغْزَلُ مِنِ امْرِئِ القَيْسِ. (Meyd, O,
TA.)
مَغْزَلٌ: see مِغْزَلٌ, in two places:
-A2-  and see
also غَزَلٌ, latter half.
مُغْزَلٌ: see مِغْزَلٌ, in three places.
مُغْزِلٌ A doe gazelle having a young one. (K.)
مِغْزَلٌ and ↓ مُغْزَلٌ (Fr, Th, S, O, Msb, K) and
↓ مَغْزَلٌ, (Th, O, K,) the first as pronounced by
[the tribe of] Temeem, the second as pronounced
by [that of] Keys, and the last the most rare,
(TA,) or the second as pronounced by Temeem,
(Msb,) A spindle; i. e. the thing with which one
spins: (S, MA, O, Msb, K. KL:) Fr says that
↓ مُغْزَلٌ is the original form, from أُغْزِلَ “ it was
made to turn round ” or “ revolve ” [or “ was
twirled ”]; (S, TA;) but the dammeh was deemed
by the Arabs difficult of pronunciation, and therefore they said مِغْزَلٌ, and in like manner مِصْحَفٌ
and مِخْدَعٌ and مِجْسَدٌ and مِطْرَفٌ: accord. to
IAth, مِغْزَلٌ signifies the instrument [with which
one spins]; and ↓ مَغْزَلٌ, the place of the غَزْل
[which means the act of spinning and the span
thread or yard]; and ↓ مُغْزَلٌ, the place in which
(فِيهِ [or this may here mean upon which]) the
غَزْل [i. e. spun thread or yarn] is put: (TA:)
pl. مَغَازِلُ. (MA.) أَعْرى مِنْ مِغْزَلٍ is a prov.
[meaning More naked than a spindle]. (Meyd.)
And one says, صَاحِبُ الغَزَلِ أَضَلُّ مِنْ سَاقِ مِغْزَلٍ
[The practiser of the talk and actions &c. usual
between the lover and the object of love is more
erring than the shank (i. e. pin) of a spindle), of
which the error is its [aiding in] clothing mankind
while it is [itself] naked. (A, TA.) ―
-b2-  It is
said in a book of certain of the Jews, عَلَيْكُمْ كَذَا
وَكَذَا وَرُبْعُ المِغْزَلِ, meaning [I pon you lie as due
from you such and such things and) the fourth
part of what your women have spun. (TA.) ―
-b3-
And [the pl.] مَغَازِلُ signifies The عَمَد (O) or عُمُد
(K) [app. meaning the upright wooden supports
of the seat] of the [machine called] نَوْرَج [q. v.]
with which the reaped grain heaped together is
thrashed. (O, K.)
مِغْزَلِىٌّ (MA) and ↓ مَغَازِلِىٌّ (S and K voce
مِصْرَمٌ) A parer of spindles. (MA.)
مُغَيْزِلٌ A slender cord (حَبْلٌ دَقِيقٌ) [so in copies
of the K, and in the CK, but in the latter المُغْتَزَلُ
is put for المُغَيْزِلُ: in my MS. copy of the K,
المُغَيْزِلُ جَبَلٌ دَقِيقٌ, and this I think to be the
correct reading. meaning El-Mugheyzil is a certain slender mountain]: ISd says, I think it to
be likened to the مِغْزَل, because of its slenderness; adding that El-Hirmázee has mentioned
it. (TA. [A verse cited by El-Hirmázee is there
given as an ex.; mentioning the day of المُغَيْزِل,
app. as the day of the separation of a lover from
his beloved; and it is a common custom of the
Arabs to call the day of an event the day of the
place where it occurred.])
مَغَازِلِىٌّ: see مِغْزَلِىٌّ.
