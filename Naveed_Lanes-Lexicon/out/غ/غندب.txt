غندبالغُنْدُبُ: see the paragraph here following.
الغُنْدُبَةُ A hard portion of flesh [app. a gland]
around [or app. on either side of] the حُلْقُوم
[which seems to mean here, as it often does, the
حَلْق, i. e. fauces, or upper part of the throat];
(O, K;) thus expl. by Lth; as also ↓ الغُنْدُبُ;
(O;) or ↓ الغُنْدُوبُ: (K:) pl. غَنَادِبُ: and it is
said that the غُنْدُبَتَانِ are [two things] like two
ganglions (شِبْهُ غُدَّتَيْنِ) in the نَكْفَتَانِ; (O, K;) in
each نَكْفَة [q. v.] is a غُنْدُبَة, and between the غندبتان
is the place of swallowing: (O:) the غَنَادِب and
the flesh that is upon them, or above them, around
the لَهَاة [app. here meaning the arches, or pillars,
of the soft palate, or the furthest part of the
mouth], compose the لَغَانِين [pl. of لُغْنُونٌ, q. v.],
which are also called the نَغَانِغ, pl. of نُغْنُغَةٌ [or
نُغْنُغٌ, q. v.]: (TA:) or the غندبتان are two
glands (عُقْدَتَانِ) in, or at, (فِى,) the root of the
tongue: (K, TA:) and they are said to be the
two amygdalæ of the fauces; i. e. the tonsils:
(اللَّوْزَتَانِ: TA:) or two portions of flesh which
are situate on either side of the لَهَاة [app. meaning
as expl. above, i. e. the arches, or pillars, of the
soft palate, or the furthest part of the mouth],
(K, TA,) and between which is a space: (TA:)
and غُنْدُبَتَا العُرْشَيْنِ is expl. as meaning the two
things that conjoin (اللَّتَانِ تَضُمَّانِ) the لَغَانِين
[above mentioned (I read اللغانين instead of
العين, an evident mistranscription in my original,
for I can only suppose the description to mean
the tonsils, as lodged between, and thus conjoining,
the anterior and posterior pillars of the soft
palate,)] on the right and left. (TA.)
الغُنْدُوبُ: see the preceding paragraph.
