غين1
غَانَ عَلَيْهِ كَذَا, [aor. يَغِينُ, inf. n. غَيْنٌ,]
Such a thing covered, veiled, or concealed, him, or
it: (Ham p. 574:) [and so ↓ أَغَانَهُ; whence]
one says, الغَيْنُ السَّمَآءَ ↓ اغان The clouds covered,
or overspread, or wholly covered, the sky. (S, K.)
And غِينَ عَلَى كَذَا Such a thing was covered
over. (S.) [Hence,] غِينَ عَلَى قَلْبِهِ, inf. n. غَيْنٌ;
as also ↓ أُغِينَ [in the CK (erroneously) اَغْيَنَ];
(assumed tropical:)  His heart was invaded by desire, or appetite, as
by a thing that covered it: or was covered [so as
to be rendered unsusceptible]: or was enveloped by
the like of rust [or clouded or rendered dull]. (K,
TA. [For الرَّيْن, meaning “ the like of rust ”
covering the heart, the CK has الدَّيْن.]) The
saying, in a trad., إِنَّهُ لَيُغَانُ عَلَى قَلْبِى (S, Msb,
TA) حَتَّى أَسْتَغْفِرَ اللّٰهَ فِى اليَوْمِ سَبْعِينَ مَرَّةً (TA)
is from the phrase غِينَ عَلَى كَذَا signifying as
expl. above, (S,) and means (assumed tropical:)  Verily my heart is
invaded as though it were covered, by unmindfulness from which mankind will not be free so
that I beg forgiveness of God in the day seventy
times: (TA:) or it means, being used metonymically, verily I become diverted from المُرَاقَبَة
[meaning the fear of God, or, as a conventional
term, the constant knowledge of God's cognition of
me in all my states or circumstances,] by the
affairs that are for good relating to the present
world; for these, though matters of importance,
are, in comparison with the affairs relating to the
other world, as idle sport, in the estimation of the
people who follow the rule of المُرَاقَبَة. (Msb.)
―
-b2-  One says also, غِينَتِ السَّمَآءُ, (Msb, TA,)
inf. n. غَيْنٌ; as also غَانَت, inf. n. غَيْنٌ; [like
غَامَت;] (TA;) The sky became covered (Msb,
TA) with غَيْن (Msb) or غَيْم (TA) [i. e. clouds,
or an expanse of clouds].
-A2-  غِنْتُ, aor. أَغِينُ,
[inf. n. غَيْنٌ,] I was, or became, thirsty. (S, K.)
And غَانَتِ الإِبِلُ i. q. غَامَت (S, K, TA) i. e. The
camels were, or became, thirsty. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And
غَانَتْ نَفْسُهُ, (S,) or نَفْسِى, (K,) aor. تَغِينُ, (S, K,)
inf. n. غَيْنٌ, (TA,) His, or my, soul [or stomach]
heaved, or became agitated by a tendency to vomit;
syn. غَثَتْ. (S, K.)

beautiful غ. (TA.)

أَغْيَنَ see the first paragraph, in three places.
غَانٌ: see غَيْنَةٌ.
غَيْنٌ [mentioned above as an inf. n. is also a
subst., as such] i. q. غَيْمٌ, (K, TA,) a dial. var.
of the latter word, (S, Msb, TA,) signifying
clouds; (TA;) [or an expanse of clouds;] as in
the phrase فِى يَوْمِ غَيْنٍ in a day of clouds: (S, *
TA:) or, meaning “ clouds,” it is from غَانَ
عَلَيْهِ كَذَا signifying as expl. in the beginning of
this art. (Ham p. 574.) ―
-b2-  And شَجَرٌ غَيْنٌ Dense,
or tangled, trees: (TA:) like غَيْمٌ. (TA in art.
غيم.)
-A2-  Also [like غَيْمٌ signifying] Thirst. (S,
K. [See also 1.])
-A3-  And [The letter غ;] one
of the letters of the alphabet: (S, K:) pl. [of
mult.] غُيُونٌ and [of pauc.] أَغْيَانٌ and غَيْنَاتٌ.
(TA.) See 2, and art. غ.
غَانَةٌ The ring at the head of the bow-string.
(K.) [See عُنْتُوتٌ.]
غَيْنَةٌ i. q. أَجَمَةٌ; [like غَيْضَةٌ, q. v.;] so in the
M; (TA;) [and it is said that] الغَيْنَةُ الشَّجْرَآءُ is
like الغَيْضَةُ الخَضْرَآءُ: or, accord. to Abu-l-
'Ameythel [or 'Omeythil], (S, TA,) غَيْنَةٌ signifies
[A collection of] tangled, or confused, or dense,
trees, (S, K, TA,) in the mountains, and in the
plain, or soft, land, (TA,) without water; (S,
K, TA;) if with water, called غَيْضَةٌ: (S, TA:)
[and Golius states, as on the authority of Yákoot,
that ↓ غَانٌ signifies the same as غَيْنَةٌ.]
غِينَةٌ The fluid that runs from a carcass, or
corpse, (S,) or from the dead: and [the humour,
or matter, termed] صَدِيد, q. v. (K.)
-A2-  See
also the next paragraph.
أَغْيَنُ Green: (S, TA:) or green inclining to
blackness: (so in one of my copies of the S:)
and [its fem.] غَيْنَآءُ is applied to a tree (شَجَرَةٌ) as
meaning green, (AO, S, K, TA,) abounding with
leaves, having tangled, or dense, branches, (AO,
S, TA,) and soft, or tender: and sometimes it is
thus applied to herbs: (TA:) or [applied to a
tree] it signifies great, having wide shade: from
the phrase غَانَ عَلَيْهِ كَذَا, expl. in the beginning
of this art.: (Ham p. 574:) and أَغْيَنُ signifies
[also] such as is tall, (K, TA,) of trees, or, by
way of comparison [thereto], of men: (TA:)
the pl. is غِينٌ: (S, TA:) which is expl. by Kr
as meaning the abundance, and collected state,
and beauty, of [the trees called] أَرَاك and سِدْر;
but what is well known is that it is pl. of غَيْنَآء
applied to a tree; of which ↓ غِينَةٌ, with kesr,
has also been mentioned as a pl., though, as ISd
says, this is not known in the [genuine] language, nor is it agreeable with the analogy of
Arabic. (TA.)
مُغْيِن, in the original form, [for مُغِين, act.
part. n. of أَغَانَ,] is used by Ru-beh in the
following verse:
أَمْسَى بِلَالٌ كَالرَّبِيعِ المُدْجِنِ
أَمْطَرَ فِى أَكْنَافِ غَيْنٍ مُغْيِنِ
[There was, or came, in the evening, a moisture
like the continual rain of winter that has rained
in the tracts of overspreading clouds]. (S.)
