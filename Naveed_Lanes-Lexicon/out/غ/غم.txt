K, TA) عَلَى النَّاسِ, (S, TA,) inf. n. غَمٌّ, (TA,)
The new moon was veiled, or concealed, (S, Msb,)
to the people, (S,) by clouds, or otherwise, (S,
Msb,) or was intercepted by thin clouds, (K, TA,)

Msb, TA.) It is said in a trad., فَإِنْ غُمَّ عَلَيْكُمْ
فَأَكْمِلُوا العِدَّةَ, (Mgh, * Msb, TA,) i. e. And if it
[the new moon] be veiled, &c., to you, then complete ye the reckoning of Shaabán, thirty [days], in
order that the entering upon the fast of Ramadán
may be with [inferential] knowledge. (Msb.) Az
says that غُمَّ and أُغْمِىَ and غُمِىَ all signify the
same: (TA:) and all three occur in the trad.
above mentioned accord. to different relations
thereof. (Mgh.) [See also 1 in art. غمى.] ―
-b2-
And [hence] غَمَّ القَمَرُ النُّجُومَ The moon concealed
the stars: or almost concealed the light of the stars.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  And غُمَّ عَلَيْهِ الخَبَرُ The information, or
narration, was dubious, confused, or vague, to

such as not to be understood; (S, K;) like أُغْمِىَ:
(S:) or was obscure, or unapparent, to him.

غَمُ3َ, inf. n.

to his mouth and his nostrils the ↓ غِمَامَة, (S, K,
TA,) which is a thing like the كِعَام [or muzzle],
(so in the S and CK,) or a thing like the فِدَام
[which seems to be here similar in meaning to
كعام]: (so in other copies of the K:) or he put
[as a covering] to his mouth a nose-bag, or the
like, to prevent his feeding; and this is termed a
↓ غِمَامَة: (TA:) [the verb that I have rendered
“ put to ” in these explanations is أَلْقَمَ, of which
I do not find in its proper place any signification
that would be exactly apposite in this case:] or
↓ غِمَامَةٌ signifies a sort of bag for the mouth of
a camel and the like, (K, TA,) his mouth being
put into it: (TA:) pl. غَمَائِمُ: (S, TA:) and one
says, غَمَّهُ بِالغِمَامَةِ [he covered his mouth with the
غمامة], aor. and inf. n. as above. (TA.) ―
-b6-  غَمَّ
الشَّىْءَ, aor.
غَمُ3َ, also signifies عَلَاهُ [app. as meaning
It rose upon, or above, the thing, as though forming a covering over it]: mentioned on the authority of IAar, who cites [as an ex.] the saying of
En-Nemir Ibn-Towlab, [app. describing a رَوْضَة,
or meadow,]
أُنُفٌ يَغُمُّ الضَّالُ نَبْتَ بِحَارِهَا
[Not depastured, the trees called ضال rising upon,
or above, the herbage of its fertile tracts, or its
tracts near to water]. (TA.) See also 8.
-A2-  [غَمَّ

inf. n. غَمٌّ and غُمُومٌ; (TA;) and ↓ أَغَمَّ; Our day
was, or became, [sultry, or] intensely hot, (S, K,
TA,) so that it took away, (S,) or almost took

غَمّ [or distress that affected the breath or respiration], arising from closeness of heat, or clouds.

him]. (K.)
4
اغمّت السَّمَآءُ The sky became clouded: (K,
as indicated by the context:) or i. q. تَغَيَّرَت [i. e.,
became altered]: thus in the S; but some say
that it is correctly تَغَيَّمَت [agreeably with the
former of the explanations above]. (TA.) See
also 1, near the end.
-A2-  مَا أَغَمَّكَ لِى and إِلَىَّ is
[an expression of wonder, meaning How great
grief, or sadness, dost thou occasion to me!] from
الغَمُّ signifying الحُزْنُ. (K, TA.) ―
-b2-  [Accord. to
the TK, أَغَمَّهُ signifies أَحْزَنَهُ; like غَمَّهُ: but this
I think a mistake. ―
-b3-  And Freytag explains أَغَمَّ
as occurring in the Deewán of the Hudhalees
signifying “ Demersit: ” but in which of its senses
he uses this word he does not specify.]
6

meaning It was tall and luxuriant.] ―
-b3-  And,
said of a man, He withheld himself from going

R. Q. 1
غَمْغَمَ, [inf. n. غَمْغَمَةٌ, He (a bull)
uttered a cry, or cries, in fright; as also ↓ تَغَمْغَمَ:
see غَمَغْمَةٌ below. ―
-b2-  And] He (a courageous
man) raised his voice conflict with his antagonist; (Har p. 531;) [as also ↓ تَغَمْغَمَ: see, again,
غَمْغَمَةٌ below.] ―
-b3-  And He [a man] spoke while
taking a thing into his fauces, so that the hearer,
or listener, did not understand what he was saying; (Har ubi suprà;) [or spoke indistinctly;
agreeably with an explanation of غَمْغَمَةٌ below;
as also ↓ تَغَمْغَمَ. ―
-b4-  And, said of a bow, It produced a sound; agreeably with another explanation of غَمْغَمَةٌ below.] ―
-b5-  Also, said of an infant,
inf. n. غَمْغَمَةٌ, He wept over the breast, desiring
the milk: [and the inf. n. is used as a simple
subst., and therefore pluralized:] IAar cites as
an ex.,
إِذَا المُرْضِعَاتُ بَعْدَ أَوَّلِ هَجْعَةٍ
↓ سَمِعْتَ عَلَى ثُدِيِّهِنَّ غَمَاغِمَا
[When the suckling women, after the first light
sleep in the beginning of the night, are in such a
condition that thou hearest cryings over their
breasts]; meaning, as he says, that the milk of
these women is little in quantity, so that the sucking child weeps over the breast when sucking it.
(TA.)
R. Q. 2
تَغَمْغَمَ: see R. Q. 1, in three places:
and see its inf. n. voce غَمْغَمَةٌ, below, in two
places. ―
-b2-  Said of one drowning (غَرِيق) beneath
the water, it signifies He uttered a cry, or cries:
or, as is said in the T, he was pressed upon by the
waves above him: a poet uses it of Pharaoh when
he was overwhelmed [in the sea]. (TA.)
غَمٌّ [an inf. n. used as an epithet in which the
quality of a subst. predominates,] Grief, mourning, lamentation, sorrow, sadness, or unhappiness;
syn. حُزْنٌ; (Msb, K;) so called because it covers
happiness and forbearance; (Msb;) or غَمّ in the
heart is thus called because it veils, or precludes,
happiness: (Ham p. 21:) [it may therefore be
rendered gloominess of mind:] or i. q. كَرْبٌ, (K,)
which signifies حُزْن, (K in art. كرب,) or غَمّ, (S,
in that art.,) [that affects the breath or respiration, lit.] that takes away the breath; (S and K
in that art.;) as also ↓ غَمَّآءُ (K) and ↓ غُمَّةٌ, (S, K,)
the last [expl. in the S as syn. with كُرْبَةٌ, which
is syn. with كَرْبٌ, and] mentioned by Lh: (TA:)
[see also صَقَعٌ:] it is كَرْب [or grief, &c.,] that
befalls the heart because of what has happened;
differing from هَمٌّ, which is كرب that befalls
because of annoyance, or harm, that is expected
to happen: or, as some say, both are one [in
meaning]: the differing is asserted by 'Iyád and
[many] others: (TA:) [see also غَصَبٌ:] the pl.
of غَمٌّ is غُمُومٌ. (S, K.) ―
-b2-  It is also an inf. n.
used as an epithet in the phrase يَوْمٌ غَمٌّ (S, TA)
i. e. A day that is [sultry, or] intensely hot, so
that it [almost] takes away the breath; and لَيْلَةٌ
غَمٌّ [such a night], i. e. ↓ غَامَّةٌ: (S:) or one says
يَوْمٌ غَمٌّ and ↓ غَامٌّ and ↓ مِغَمٌّ, (K, TA,) the last
with kesr to the م, (TA,) [in the CK ↓ مُغِمٌّ,]
meaning a day of heat, (K,) or of intense heat:
(TA:) or a day of غَمّ [i. e. grief, &c.]: and [in
a similar sense, as is implied by the context immediately preceding,] لَيْلَةٌ غَمٌّ and غَمَّةٌ and ↓ غَمَّى:
(K:) [but] A'Obeyd mentions, on the authority
of AZ, ↓ لَيْلَةٌ غَمَّى and ↓ لَيْلَةٌ غَمَّةٌ as meaning a
night in which there is over the sky [a covering of
clouds, or] what is termed غَمْىٌ [a word belonging
to art. غمى, being in measure] like رَمْىٌ; (S;)
and [in the like sense] يَوْمٌ غَمٌّ. (So in one of my
copies of the S.) ―
-b3-  And one says, كَانَ عَلَى
السَّمَآءِ غم [app. غَمٌّ, but this, I think, requires
confirmation, for which I have searched in vain,]
and غمى [app. ↓ غَمَّى, or perhaps غَمْىٌ, a word
mentioned above,] meaning There was over the
sky a collection [or an expanse] of thin clouds, or
a ضَبَابَة [i. e. mist, or the like], فَحَالَ دُونَ الهِلَالِ
[and it intercepted the new moon]: and هٰذِهِ لَيْلَةُ
↓ غَمَّى, and some say ↓ غُمَّى, This is a night [of
a covering of clouds, or] of a ضَبَابَة [or mist, or
the like], intervening between the new moon and
men; so that the new moon is not seen: (Msb:)
and [hence] ↓ صُمْنَا لِلْغَمَّى, and ↓ لِلْغُمَّى, (S, Msb,
K,) both mentioned by ISk on the authority of
Fr, (S,) and ↓ لِلْغَمَّآءِ, (S, K,) and ↓ لِلْغُمِّيَّةِ, (K,
TA, but omitted in the CK,) and ↓ لِلْغُمَّةِ, (TA,)
[i. e. We fasted after, or from the time of, the
covering of clouds, or the mist, or the like, that
concealed the new moon; (the prep. لِ being here
used in the sense of بَعْدَ, or مِنْ وَقْتِ, as in the
Kur xvii. 80;) virtually] meaning [we fasted]
without a sight [of the new moon]: (Msb, TA:)
a rájiz says,
طَامِسٍ هِلَالُهَا ↓ لَيْلَةَ غُمَّى
أَوْغَلْتُهَا وَمُكْرَةٌ إِيْغَالُهَا
[In a night of a covering of clouds, or of a mist,
or the like, having its new moon effaced: I journeyed quickly and far in it, (أَوْغَلْتُهَا) being used,
app. by poetic license, for أَوْغَلْتُ فِيهَا,) and disliked was the journeying so therein]: (S, TA:)
and it is said that لَيْلَةُ غمّى [i. e. ↓ غَمَّى and
↓ غُمَّى] signifies also the last night of the [lunar]
month; being so called because the case thereof
is veiled to people so that it is not known whether
it be of the coming [month] or of the past. (TA.)
