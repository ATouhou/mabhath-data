غوث1
غَاثَ: see 4.
-A2-  [And see also غَوِيثٌ.]
2
غوّث, (S, K,) inf. n. تَغْوِيثٌ; (K;) and
↓ استغاث; (TA;) He cried out, (TA,) and said,
(S, K,) ↓ وَا غَوْثَاهُ (S, K, TA) [Alas! a cry for
aid, or succour! also pronounced وا غَوْثَاهِ (accord.
to one of my copies of the S) and وا غَوْثَاهْ]. You
say, ضُرِبَ فُلَانٌ فَغَوَّثَ Such a one was beaten, and
cried وا غوثاه. (TA.) This is declared by the
leading grammarians to be the primary signification of غوّث: then they used it as meaning He
cried out, or called, desiring, or demanding, aid,
or succour. (MF.)
-A2-  See also غَوِيثٌ.
4
اغاثهُ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. إِغَاثَةٌ (Msb, K)
and ↓ مَغُوثَةٌ [which is anomalous], (K,) He aided,
or succoured, him; (Msb;) He (i. e. God, Msb)
removed from him trouble, or affliction: (Msb,
TA:) ↓ غَاثَهُ, aor. يَغِيثُهُ, is used in the sense of
اغاثهُ, but is rare, and is said [by some] to be
from الغَيْثُ, not الإِغَاثَةُ: غاثهُ, aor. يَغُوثُهُ, is mentioned by Az as not heard by him from any one;
but ISd mentions غاثهُ, inf. n. غَوْثٌ and غِيَاثٌ,
though saying that اغاثهُ is more approved. (TA.)
And one says also, أَغَاثَنَا المَطَرُ (assumed tropical:)  [The rain gave
us relief]. (Msb.)
6
تَغَاوَثُوا, accord. to Freytag, appears to be
used in the Deewán of the Hudhalees as signifying They said, one to another, وَا غَوْثَاهُ:
-A2-  and
تغاوث as syn. with أَغَاثَ.]
10
استغاثهُ, (S, O, Msb, K,) and استغاث بِهِ,
(O, Msb, TA,) the latter disallowed by some,
but used by Sb, (TA,) He sought, desired, or
demanded, aid, or succour, of, or by means of,
him, or it; he sought, &c., [or called for,] his
aid, or succour. (O, MF, TA.) ―
-b2-  See also 2.
[Hence, استغاث العُودُ (assumed tropical:)  The lute sent forth plaintive sounds: a modern phrase.]
غَوْثٌ and ↓ غُوَاثٌ and ↓ غَوَاثٌ, (S, K,) the last
deviating from the common course of speech, (K,
TA,) with respect to analogy, as will be seen
from what follows, (TA,) A cry for aid, or succour. (S, K, KL, PS.) One says, أَجَابَ اللّٰهُ
↓ دُعَآءَهُ وغُوَاثَهُ and ↓ غَوَاثَهُ [God answered his
prayer, and his cry for aid]. (Fr, S.) ↓ غَوَاثٌ
is said by Fr to be the only word significant of
a sound, or cry, having fet-h [to the first letter];
other words of this kind being with damm, as
بُكَآءٌ and دُعَآءٌ, or with kesr, as نِدَآءٌ and صِيَاحٌ.

the paragraph here following.
غِيَاثٌ, (S, Msb, K, &c.,) in which the و is
changed into ى because of the kesreh preceding
it, (S,) a form disapproved by some of the lexicographers, but several others assign to it priority,
(MF,) a subst. from أَغَاثَهُ, (S, Msb, K, &c.,) as
also ↓ غَوَاثٌ, ascribed by Ibn-Hajar to the majority,
and ↓ غُوَاثٌ, mentioned on the authority of Aboo-Dharr, (MF,) and ↓ غَوْثٌ; (Msb;) signifying
Aid, or succour; (Msb;) or deliverance from
difficulty, distress, or adversity, and [from] revenge; and aid to release from difficulties, distresses, or adverse circumstances. (MF.) In the
T, الغِيَاثُ is expl. as signifying That with which
God aids, or succours, one. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And غِيَاثٌ
signifies also An aider, or a succourer: you say,
فُلَانٌ غِيَاثُنَا Such a one is our aider, or succourer;
i. q. ↓ مُغِيثُنَا: (TA in art. نور:) and God is said
to be غِيَاثُ المُسْتَغِيثِينَ [The Aider of the seekers

Adam and Noah, and of whom, after his death,
was made an image, which, after a long time,
became an object of worship; like وَدٌّ and سُوَاعٌ
and يَغُوقُ and نَسْرٌ, mentioned therewith in the
Kur lxxi. 22 and 23. (Bd.)
