غَمَصٌ Fluid filth [or foul matter] in the inner
corner of the eye: (Mgh:) or what is fluid of
[the filth, or foul matter, or white filth, which
collects in the inner corner of the eye, and which,
when concrete, is called] رَمَص: (S, K:) or a
thing like froth, which the eye emits; a portion
whereof is termed ↓ غَمَصَةٌ: (TA:) or what resembles white froth, in the side of the eye: but
رَمَصٌ is in the side of the eyelashes: (ISh:) or
both these words signify dirt which the eye
emits: or غَمَصٌ is what is concrete. (M in art.
رمص.)
غَمِصٌ, a possessive epithet, A great imputer of
vices or faults. (TA.)
غَمَصَةٌ: see غَمَصٌ.

-A2-  الغَمُوصُ: see

مَا فِى فُلَانٍ غَمِيصَةٌ There is not in such a one
anything for which his character is to be impugned, or for which he is to be blamed, censured,
or spoken against; any vice, or fault; i. q.
غَمِيزَةٌ. (A.)
غُمَيْصَآءُ dim. of غَمْصَآءُ [fem. of أَغْمَصُ]. (TA.)
Hence, (TA,) الغُمَيْصَآءُ [The star Procyon;] one
of the شِعْرَيَانِ, (S, K,) whereof the other is
الشِّعْرَى العَبُورُ [i. e. Sirius]: (TA:) the former is
also called ↓ الغَمُوصُ, (S, K,) and الرُّمَيْصَآءُ,
(TA,) and الشِّعْرَى الشَّامِيَّةُ: (IAth:) it is one of
the Mansions of the Moon [accord. to those who
make the term نَوْءٌ to signify the auroral setting;
namely, the Seventh]; (TA;) and is in the ذِرَاع;
(S;) i. e., it is the greater of the two stars called
الذِّرَاعُ المَقْبُوضَةُ: (IAth:) it is called الغميصاء
because of its smallness and its littleness of light
[in comparison with the other شعرى], from غَمَصُ
العَيْنِ: (TA:) [or the reason of its being so
called is this:] the Arabs assert that the شِعْرَيَانِ
are the sisters of سُهَيْل [or Canopus]; (IDrd, S;)
and that they [three] were together; but that
سهيل descended into the south, and الشِّعْرَى
اليَمَانِيَّةُ [which is Sirius] followed it; (IDrd;)
this latter, they say, crossed the Milky way, and
was therefore named العَبُورُ; and الغميصاء
remained in her place, weeping for the loss of the
two others until her eye became affected with
غَمَص: (IDrd, K: *) they also assert that thou
seest العبور when she rises as though she desired
to cross [the Milky Way] (كَأَنَّهَا تَسْتَعْبِرُ); but
الغميصاء thou seest not [as yet in any part of
Arabia], she having wept until she has become
affected with غَمَص. (S.)
أَغْمَصُ Having, in his eye, what is termed
غَمَصٌ, q. v.: (Mgh, K:) or disordered in the eye;
whose eyes are dim, or watery; like أَعْمَشُ: (L
and TA in art. عمش:) fem. غَمْصَآءُ: and pl. غُمْصٌ.
(TA.)
هُوَ مَغْمُوصٌ عَلَيْهِ He is censured, or blamed, or
reproached, (S, K,) with respect to his religion,
(S, A, K,) and with respect to his grounds of
pretension to respect. (A.) It is said in a trad.,
إِلَّا مَغْموصٌ عَلَيْهِ النِّفَاقُ, meaning, Except one
censured, &c., with respect to his religion; accused,
or suspected, of hypocrisy. (TA.)
أَنَا مُسْتَغْمِصٌ مِنْ هٰذَا الخَبَرِ وَمُتَوَهِّمٌ [I am
suspicious of this information, and opining;] is
said by one when a piece of information rejoices
him but he fears that it may not be true; or
when he fears it and yet it rejoices him. (TA.)
