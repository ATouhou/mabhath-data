غصب1
غَصَبَهُ, (S, A, Msb, K,) aor.
غَصِبَ, (Msb, K,)
inf. n. غَصْبٌ; (S, Mgh, Msb;) and ↓ اغتصبهُ;
(S, Msb, K;) He took it wrongfully, unjustly, or
injuriously; (S, A, Mgh, K;) or by force; (Mgh,
Msb;) مِنْهُ and عَلَيْهِ [i. e. from him], both meaning the same. (S.) الغَصْبُ repeatedly occurs in
the traditions, signifying The taking another's
property wrongfully, unjustly, injuriously, or by
violence. (L.) But as employed in law, it means
The taking property that has a price and is forbidden, without the permission of its owner, without stealthiness: therefore it does not rightly apply
in the case of an animal that has died a natural
death or not been slaughtered according to the
law, because it is not property; nor in the case
of the free person, in like manner; nor in the
case of the wine of the Muslim, because it has
not a price; nor in the case of the property of
him with whom one is at war, because it is not
forbidden; the saying “ without the permission
of the owner ” precludes the trust, or deposit;
and the saying “ without stealthiness ” excludes
theft. (KT.) ―

غَصَبَ الجِلْدَ, (K, TA,) inf. n. as above, (TA,)
(assumed tropical:)  He removed from the skin its hair and its fur by
plucking and peeling, without subjecting it to the
process termed عَطْنٌ, in the tan, and without
إِغْمَال [i. e. burying it] in moist earth, (K, TA,)

expl. by the Arabs. (TA.)
