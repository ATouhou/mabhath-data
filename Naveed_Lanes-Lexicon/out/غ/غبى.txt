اغبت السَّمَآءُ, inf. n. إِغْبَآءٌ, The sky rained such
rain as is termed غَبْيَة [q. v.]. (AZ, S.)
غَبْيَةٌ A rain that is not copious, (S, K,) but
exceeding such as is termed بَغْشَة [q. v.]: (S:) or
a vehement shower (K, TA) of rain: (TA:) pl.
غَبَيَاتٌ. (S.) ―
-b2-  [And app. (assumed tropical:)  A shower of arrows.]
شَرُّ الغَبَيَاتِ غَبْيَةُ النَّبْلِ which seems clearly to
mean (assumed tropical:)  The worst of showers is the shower of
arrows] is a saying mentioned by As. (TA.)
―
-b3-  Also An abundant pouring of water: ―
-b4-  and
likewise (assumed tropical:)  of سِيَاط [i. e. stokes of the whip, or
lashes]: (K, TA:) thought by ISd to be thus
termed as being likened to the غَبَيَات of rain.
(TA.) ―
-b5-  And, as being likened to the rain thus
termed, (tropical:)  A running after another running: [but]
A'Obeyd says, it is like a leap in pace or going.
(S. [In three copies of the S, I find الغَبْيَةُ كَالوَثْبَةِ
فِى السَّيْرِ as the explanation given by A'Obeyd:
in one of my copies of the S, الغَبْيَةُ كَالزُّبْيَةِ: and
in the TA, الغَيْبَةُ كالزبية فى السير: I have followed the first of these readings, as I cannot
doubt its being the right.]) ―
-b6-  Also Dust of the
earth. that has risen, or that has spread, or diffused itself; (K, TA;) as also ↓ غَبَآءٌ; thus correctly; but in [some of] the copies of the K غِبَآء,
like كِسَآء; [and accord. to other copies غَبًا;] it
is like dust in the sky: or, as some say, it is the
earth, or dust, with which the head [or mouth] of
the well is stopped up, upon the corer. (TA.) [See
also art. غبو.]
-A2-  One says also, جَاؤُوا عَلَى غَبْيَةِ
الشَّمْسِ, meaning غَيْبَتِهَا [i. e. They came at, or in
the time of, the setting of the sun]: (K, TA;) in
which instance it is thought by ISd to be formed
by transposition. (TA. [See also 1 in art. غبو.])

سَمَآءٌ مُغْبِيَةٌ A sky raining such rain as is termed
غَبِيَة [q. v.] (AZ, S.)
مُغَبَّاةٌ i. q. مُغَطَّاةٌ: so in the saying, حَفَرَ مُغَبَّاةً
[He dug a pitfall which he afterwards covered
over with earth]: and [hence] one says, دَفَنَ لِى
فُلَانٌ مُغْبَّاةً ثُمَّ حَمَلَنِى عَلَيْهَا [lit. Such a one
covered over a pitfall for me, then urged me to go
upon it], meaning (assumed tropical:)  such a one caused me to fall
