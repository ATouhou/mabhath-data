be thine for the debt. ” (Msb.) This is forbidden
in a trad. (S, Mgh, O, Msb, &c.) It is said in

فِيهِ لَكَ غُنْمُهُ وُعَلَيْكَ غُرْمُهُ [meaning It shall not
become a forfeit to the receiver with what is
involved in it: (or, accord. to an explanation of

shall pertain the increase of it (the pledge), and
its growth, and its excess in value, [if it have any,]
and upon him (the receiver of it) shall be the responsibility [to make compensation] for it if it
perish [through his fault, in his possession], (O.

and explanations of this trad. in the Mgh &c.;
but what I have here given, from the O and
Msb, appear to me to be the most approvable.

thou of, or avoid thou, the being disquieted, or disquieted by grief [or anger]: or, as some say, the
meaning is, التَّطْلِيقَاتُ حَتَّى لَا يَبْقَى مِنْهَا ↓ لَا يُغْلَقُ
شَىْءٌ (assumed tropical:)  [i. e. The sentences of divorce shall not be
closed, or concluded, at once, by one's saying

cannot be [partially] raised from contact with
him [so as to be bearable by him]. (TA.)

bad, (S, O, K,) and rejected; (S;) and غَلْقٌ is
[said to be] the subst. from أَغْلَقَ; (S, Mgh, K;)
whence the saying of a poet,
وَبَابٍ إِذَا مَا مَالَ لِلْغَلْقِ يَصْرِفُ
[And a door that, when it turns to be locked, or
closed, creaks]: (S, O, Mgh: *) and one says,
الأَبْوَابَ ↓ غَلَّقْتُ [I locked, or closed, the doors];
the verb being with teshdeed to denote multiplicity [of the objects]; (Sb, S, TA;) [and] it is
so to denote muchness [of the action] or intensiveness, (O,) [for] one says also, البَابَ ↓ غلّق, a
chaste phrase; El-Isbahánee says that ↓ غَلَّقْتُ
signifies I locked, or closed, (أَغْلَقْتُ,) many doors,
or a door several times, or a door well or thoroughly;
(TA;) and one says also أَغْلَقْتُ الأَبْوَابَ; (S, O,
TA;) said by Sb to be a good Arabic phrase;
(TA;) but this is rare; (O;) El-Farezdak says,
مَا زِلْتُ أَفْتَحُ أَبْوَابًا وَأُغْلِقُهَا

a trad., لَا طَلَاقَ وَلَا عَتَاقَ فِى إِغْلَاقٍ (assumed tropical:)  [There is no

in a case of constraint]; (Mgh, * O, TA;) for the

TA:) whence the phrase مَنْ أَغْلَقَ ظَهْرَهُ [meaning

applied, in a trad., to one of those for whom the
Prophet will intercede; the sins that have burdened the back of the man being likened to the
weight of the load of the camel: [but] it is also

Ignorance; that when the camels of any one of
them amounted to a hundred, أَغْلَقُوا بَعِيرًا, i. e.
(assumed tropical:)  They displaced the سَنَاسِن [pl. of سِنْسِنٌ, q. v.]

TA) in an intense degree, not eaten by anything:
it is dried, then bruised, and beaten, with water,
and skins are macerated in it, in consequence of
which there remains not upon them a hair nor a
particle of fur nor a bit of flesh; this being done
when they desire to throw the skins into the tan,
whether they be of oxen or of sheep or goats or of
other animals; and it is bruised, and carried into
the various districts or towns for this purpose:
(O, TA:) it is found in El-Hijáz and Tihámeh:

[or plant]; (O;) and it is a poison; a mixture

فِى مُضَعَّفِ المَيْسِرِ [i. e. the seventh arrow, app.
belonging to the class, of the arrows of the game
of الميسر, to which manifold portions are assigned;
for المُضَعَّفُ as used in relation to the game called
الميسر I do not find expl. otherwise than as an
appellation of “ the second of the arrows termed
الغُفْل, to which are assigned no portion; ” (see
art. ضعف, and see also سَفِيحٌ;) and this cannot
be here meant, as the seventh arrow (which is
commonly called المُعَلَّى) has seven portions
assigned to it: therefore it seems that مُضَعَّف is
here used, if not mistakenly, in a sense which,
though admissible, is unusual in a case of this
kind]: (O, K:) pl. مَغَالِقُ: (S, O, K: in the
CK [erroneously] مَغَالِيقُ:) or المُغَالِقُ is one of
the epithets applied to the winning arrows, and is
not one of their [particular] names; (O, K;) they
being those that make what is played-for to be
a forfeit to the player (تُغْلِقُ الخَطَرَ لِلْقَامِرِ): so
accord. to Az, who says that Lth has made a
mistake in his explanation. (O.)
