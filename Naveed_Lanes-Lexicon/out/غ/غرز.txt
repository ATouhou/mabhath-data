no; but if from a desire of putting them in a
good state for sale, yes: ” and IAth says that the
تغريز thereof may mean them increase, or offspring, (نِتَاج,) and fatness; from غَرْزُ الشَّجَرِ [the
planting of trees]; but that the more proper
explanation is that before given [which appears
to be one of the explanations here preceding].

حَمْض: or, as some say, the [kind of rush called]
أَسَل: and spears are so called as being likened
thereto: As says, it is a plant which I have seen
in the desert, growing in plain, or soft, tracts of
land: (TA:) or its growth is like that of the
[sweet rush called] إِذْخِر; of the worst of pasture:

it is slaughtered, the غَرَز is found in her stomach
separate from the water, not diffused: and it
does not beget the cattle strength: the n. un. is
with ة: it has been erroneously mentioned as
being called عَرَز, with the unpointed ع (TA.)

السِّمَاكُ قَطُّ إِلَّا غَارِزًا ذَنَبَهُ فِى بَرْدٍ [(assumed tropical:)  Es-Simák has

cold]; meaning السِّمَاكُ الأَعْزَلُ, a well-known

of the Moon,] which rises with the dawn on the
5th of Tishreen el-Owwal, [or October O. S.,
nearly agreeing with my calculation, accord. to
which it rose aurorally in Central Arabia, about
