غنم1
غَنِمَ, (S, Msb, K,) aor.
غَنَمَ, (Msb,) inf. n.
غُنْمٌ (S, MA, Msb, * K, KL) and غَنْمٌ, (K,) or,
as some say, the former is a simple subst. and
the latter is an inf. n., (TA,) and غَنَمٌ and غَنِيمَةٌ
and غُنْمَانٌ, (K,) He, or they, (i. e. a man, Msb,
or a party of men, S,) obtained, got, or took,
(Msb, K, * TK,) spoil, (K, * TK,) or a thing [as
spoil]. (Msb, TA.) [And He acquired, or gained,
a thing without difficulty, or trouble, or inconvenience: or in this sense the inf. n. is غُنْمٌ,
which see below, voce غَنِيمَةٌ.] مَا غَنِمْتُمْ in the
Kur viii. 42 means What ye take by force [in
war] from the unbelievers. (Bd, Jel.) [See
also 8.]
2
غَنَّمْتُهُ, inf. n. تَغْنِيمٌ, I gave him spoil, or a
free and disinterested gift; syn. نَفَّلْتُهُ: (S:) or
غَنَّمَهُ كَذَا, inf. n. as above, he gave him such a
thing as spoil, or as a free and disinterested gift;
syn. نَفَّلَهُ إِيَّاهُ. (K.)
4
أَغْنَمَهُ الشَّىْءَ He made the thing to be to him
spoil. (TA.)
5
تَغَنَّمَ see 8. ―
-b2-  One says also, هُوَ يَتَغَنَّمُ الأَمْرَ,
meaning He eagerly desires the affair like as one
eagerly desires spoil. (TA.)
-A2-  And تغنّم, (TA
in the present art.,) or تغنّم غَنَمًا, (AZ, T and TA
in art. ابل,) He took for himself, got, gained, or
acquired, sheep or goats or both: like as one says
تأبّل إِبِلًا. (AZ, T and TA in art. ابل; and TA *
in the present art.)
8
اغتنمهُ, as also ↓ تغنّمهُ, He reckoned it spoil:
(S, K:) or both signify he took, seized, caught, or
snatched, it as spoil. (KL.) ―
-b2-  And [hence] one
says, اغتنم الفُرْصَةَ He took, or seized, or [availed
himself of,] the opportunity; or he hastened to
take it; syn. اِنْتَهَزَهَا. (S and A and K in
art. نهز.)
غُنْمٌ: see غَنِيمَةٌ, in three places. ―
-b2-  It signifies
also [The regaining (as is shown by an explanation of A 'Obeyd cited in the first paragraph of
art. غلق), and] the increase, and growth, and
excess in value, of a pledge. (O in art. غلق, and
TA in the present art.) Thus in a trad., in which
it is said, الرَّهْنُ لِمَنْ رَهَنَهُ لَهُ غُنْمُهُ وَعَلَيْهِ غُرْمُهُ [The
pledge pertains to him who pledged it; to him pertains the regaining of it, and its increase, and
growth, and excess in value, if such there be, and
upon him lies the obligation to pay the debt for it,
without requiring any abatement thereof if the
pledge have unavoidably suffered damage or total
loss: see the explanation of A 'Obeyd mentioned
above]. (TA.) الغُنْمُ بِالغُرْمِ means The غُنْم is
compensated (مُقَابَلٌ) by the غُرْم [i. e. the regaining of the pledge, with the increase and the growth
and the excess in value thereof if such there be, is
compensated by the payment of the debt for it];
for like as the owner [of the pledge] is exclusively
entitled to the غُنْم, no one sharing it with him,
so he bears the غُرْم, no one bearing it with him:
and this is the meaning of their saying, الغُرْمُ
مَجْبُورٌ بِالغُنْمِ [which may therefore be rendered
The loss suffered by the payment of the debt is
repaired by the regaining of the pledge; app. a
phrase of the lawyers, implying that such is to
be considered as the case whatever be the state of
the pledge at the time of its being restored unless
it have suffered damage through the fault of the
pledgee]. (Msb.) [See more in the first paragraph of art. غلق.] ―
-b3-  See also غُنَامَاكَ.
-A2-  غنم
[app. غُنْمٌ] is mentioned by Suh as the name of
A certain idol. (TA.)
غَنَمٌ i. q. شَآءٌ, (T, Msb, K,) meaning Sheep and
goats; (Msb;) [and both together;] a gen. n.,
(S, Msb, K,) of the fem. gender, (S, K,) applied
to the males and the females, and to both
together: (S, Msb, K:) it has no sing. from
which it is derived, the sing. being شاة: the dual
غَنَمَانِ is used as meaning two flocks or herds [of
sheep or of goats or of both together]; (Msb, K;)
each flock or herd having its distinct place of
pasture and its pastor: (Msb, TA: *) and hence
it is said in a trad. that the poor-rate [meaning a
portion thereof] is to be given to him to whom
the year of drought has left a غَنَم, but not to
him to whom it has left غَنَمَيْنِ: (TA:) the pl.
is أَغْنَامٌ, (Msb, K,) [properly a pl. of pauc.,]
sometimes used, (Msb,) meaning flocks or herds
of غَنَم, (Msb and TA in art. ابل,) and also غُنُومٌ
and أَغَانِمُ, (K,) the last used in an ode of Aboo-Jundab El-Hudhalee: (TA:) the dim. is ↓ غُنَيْمَةٌ,
with ة, because quasi-pl. ns. of the class having
no sing. from which they are derived, when
applied to what are not human beings, are constantly fem.; so one says خَمْسٌ مِنَ الغَنَمِ ذُكُورٌ
[five of sheep, males], making the n. of number
fem., though one means rams, when it is followed
by مِنَ الغَنَمِ, for the n. of number is masc. and
fem. accord. to the word, not accord. to the
meaning. (S.) ―
-b2-  In the saying لَا آتِيكَ غَنَمَ الفِزْرِ
i. e. حَتَّى تَجْتَمِعَ غَنَمُ الفِزْرِ [I will not come to
thee until the sheep, or goats, of El-Fizr congregate], غنم [with its complement] is made to
stand in the place of الدَّهْر, [the meaning being,
I will not come to thee ever,] and is [therefore]
put in the accus. case as though it were an adv. n.
[of time]. (TA. [This saying with مِعْزَى in the
place of غَنَمَ is mentioned by El-Meydánee in his
“ Proverbs,” and thus in the S and K in art. فزر.
For an explanation of its origin see Freytag's
Arab. Prov. ii. 484.]) ―
-b3-  الأَغْنَامُ is the name of
(assumed tropical:)  Certain small stars between the legs of Cepheus
and the star الجَدْىُ. (Kzw, in his descr. of
Cepheus.) [See شَاةٌ (in art. شوه), last sentence.]
غَنِيمٌ: see what next follows.
غَنِيمَةٌ and ↓ مَغْنَمٌ (S, Msb, K) and ↓ غَنِيمٌ and
↓ غُنْمٌ all signify فَىْءٌ [as meaning Spoil,
booty, or plunder]: and the acquisition of a thing
without difficulty, or trouble, or inconvenience: or
this is termed ↓ غُنْمٌ, and فَىْءٌ is termed غَنِيمَةٌ:
(K:) or, accord. to A 'Obeyd, الغَنِيمَةُ signifies
what is obtained from the believers in a plurality
of gods, by force, during war; (Mgh, Msb:)
and of this, a fifth is to be taken, [and applied in
the manner prescribed in the Kur viii. 42,] and
what remains after the fifth is for those who have
obtained it, exclusively; (Mgh;) the horseman
having three shares, and the foot-soldier having
one share: (Az, TA:) and الفَىْءُ signifies what
is obtained from them after the laying-down of
arms, (Mgh, Msb,) when the country, or place,
becomes a country, or place, of Islám; and this
is for all of the Muslims, and is not to be divided
into fifths: (Mgh:) or the فَىْء is what God has
given, or restored, of the possessions of the believers in a plurality of gods, to the Muslims,
without war, such as the poll-tax, and that for
which peace has been made with them; and of
this also a fifth is to be applied in the manner
prescribed by God, and the remainder is to be
expended in the purchase of horses and weapons
and other apparatus for the defence of the
frontiers: (Az, TA:) and النَّفَلُ is what is given
to the warrior in addition to his share; and is
when the Imám or the commander says, “He who
slays one shall have his spoil; ” or says to a detachment, “What ye obtain shall be yours,” or “ the
quarter of it,” or “ the half of it; ” and it is not
divided into fifths; and it lies on the Imám to
fulfil the promise: or, accord. to 'Alee Ibn-'Eesà,
الغَنِيمَةُ is more general in signification than النَّفَلُ;
and الفَىْءُ is more so than الغَنِيمَةُ, because it is a
name for everything of the possessions of the believers in a plurality of gods that becomes the
property of the Muslims: accord. to the lawyers,
everything that may be lawfully taken, of their
possessions, is فَىْء: (Mgh:) the pl. of غَنِيمَةٌ is
غَنَائِمُ; and the pl. of ↓ مَغْنَمٌ is مَغَانِمُ, (Msb, TA,)
and غُنُومٌ occurs as pl. of ↓ غُنْمٌ. (TA.) غَنِيمَةٌ
بَارِدَةٌ see expl. in art. برد.
غُنِيْمَةٌ dim. of غَنَمٌ, q. v. (S.)
غُنَامَاكَ أَنْ تَفَعَلَ كَذَا (S, K, * TA) means The
utmost of thy power, or ability, and of thy case,
(S, * TA,) and that which thou eagerly desirest
like as one desires spoil, (S, * JM, TA, *) [is, or
will be, thy doing such a thing;] i. q. قُصَارَاكَ:
(K, TA: [see also عُنَانَاكَ, in art. عن:]) and so
↓ غُنْمُكَ: (TA:) and [in like manner] one says,
أَنْ يَفْعَلَ كَذَا ↓ غُنَيْمَاؤُهُ, like حُسَيْنَاؤُهُ, meaning
قُصَارَاهُ [The utmost of his power, &c.]. (TA in
art. حسن.)
غُنَيْمَاؤُهُ: see what next precedes.
غَانِمٌ Taking, or a taker, of غَنِيمَة [or spoil].
(TA.) ―
-b2-  See also two exs. voce شَاجِبٌ.
مَغْنَمٌ: see غَنِيمَةٌ, in two places.
غَنَمٌ مُغْنَمَةٌ and مُغَنَّمَةٌ Sheep, or goats, collected
together: (TA:) or many or numerous: (K,
TA:) or, accord. to AZ, one of these two
epithets, thus applied, [probably the latter, like
مُؤَبَّلَةٌ applied to إِبِلٌ, as he seems to say,] signifies [app. divided into distinct flocks or herds,]
each [flock or herd] having its own pastor.
(TA.)
