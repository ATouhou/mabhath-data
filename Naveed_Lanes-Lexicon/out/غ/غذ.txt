غَذَّ, aor.
غَذِ3َ (S, O, L, K, &c.) and
غَذُ3َ, (K,)
but the former aor. only is known, (MF,) inf. n.
غَدٌّ, (S, O, L,) It (a wound) flowed with what
was in it; as also ↓ اغذّ: (K:) or flowed with
thick purulent matter; (S, O;) as also ↓ اغذّ [and
غَثَّ] and اغثّ: (O, L:) or flowed with purulent
matter, thick or thin: (Az, O, L:) or became
swollen: (Lth, L, K:) or this is a mistake; the
true signification being that next preceding. (Az,
O, L.) You say, تَرَكْتُ جُرْحَهُ يَغِذُّ [I left his
wound flowing with thick, or thin, purulent matter]. (S.) ―
-b2-  Also It (a vein) flowed with blood
without stopping; (O, L;) and so ↓ اغذّ. (L.)
―
-b3-  [And, accord. to Freytag, as on the authority
of Meyd, He delayed, or loitered, and remained
behind, in (فِى) a journey.]
-A2-  And غَدَّهُ He
diminished, or impaired, to him; or made him to
lose; syn. نَقَصَهُ; (O, K;) as also مِنْهُ ↓ غَذْغَذَ.
(O, K.) You say, مَا غَذَذْتُكَ شَيْئًا i. e. مَا نَقَصْتُكَ
[I did not diminish to thee, &c., or I have not
diminished to thee, &c., aught]. (O.)

اغذّ: see 1, in three places. ―
-b2-  اغذّ فِى السَّيْرِ,
(S, * O, * L, K,) inf. n. إِغْذَاذٌ; (S, O, L;) and اغذّ
السَّيْرَ; (L, K;) He hastened in the pace or
journeying; (S, O, L, K;) and he hastened the
pace or journeying. (L, K.) ―
-b3-  And Abu-l-Hasan
Ibn-Keysán thinks, from the use of the phrase
سَيْرٌ مُغِذٌّ, that one says also, اغذّ السَّيْرُ, meaning
The pace, or journeying, was quick. (L.)
R. Q. 1
غَذْغَذَ: see 1, last sentence but one.
R. Q. 2
تَغَذْغَدَ He leaped, sprang, or bounded.
(O, K.)
غَذِيذَةٌ Thick purulent matter (S, O, L, K) of a
wound; as also غَثِيثَةٌ. (S, O, L.) Yaakoob says
that the ذ of the former is a substitute for the ث
of the latter; (L;) and so says Ibn-es-Seed.
(TA.)
غَاذٌّ [act. part. n. of 1, q. v.: as such signifying
A vein incessantly bleeding. (L.) ―
-b2-  Also A recrudescence (عَرَب [inf. n. of عَرِبَ], so in the O, in
copies of the K غَرَب, and in the CK غَرْب, [app.
a mistranscription suggested by another explanation of غَاذٌّ which will be found in what follows,])
in any part of the body. (L, K.) AZ says, what
we call العَرَبُ, the Arabs term الغَاذُّ. (O.) One
says of a camel that has had a gall on the back
which has healed but is, or becomes, moist [or
exuding], بِهِ غَاذٌّ [He has a gall which has healed
but is moist, or constantly discharging, or exuding].
(S, O, L.) ―
-b3-  And A vein, or duct, in the eye,
[also called غَرْبٌ,] which flows incessantly. (L, K.)
In this sense, and in that immediately preceding,
it is a subst. like كَاهِلٌ and غَارِبٌ. (L.)
-A2-  And
الغَاذُّ signifies الحِسُّ: one says, قَطَعَ اللّٰهُ غَاذَّ فُلَانٍ
i. e. حِسَّهُ [app. meaning May God cause to cease
the sound of such a one]. (Ibn-'Abbád, O)
الغَاذَةُ The part that is in a state of commotion,
[or that pulses,] of the top of the head of a [young]
child; as also الغَاذِيَةُ [which belongs to art. غذو].
(IAar, K, TA.)
أَغَذُّ More, or most, or very, quick, and brisk,
or sprightly. (L.)
سَيْرٌ مُغِذٌّ A quick pace or journeying: a phrase
like لَيْلٌ نَائِمٌ. (L. [See also 4: and see an ex.
voce مُرِذٌّ, in art. رذ.])
مُغَاذٌّ A camel that loathes water. (S, O, L, K.)
