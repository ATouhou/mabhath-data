لَعَمْرِى فِى البِلَادِ وَأَنْجَدَا ↓ أَغَارَ
[meaning, accord. to the first explanation of اغار,
A prophet who seeth what ye see not, and whose
fame has come to the low lands, by my life, or by
my religion, in the several regions, and has come
to the high lands]: As says that اغار signifies has
gone quickly; and انجد, has risen; and that the
poet does not mean has come to the low lands nor
to the high lands; holding غار only to signify the
coming to the low land: but Fr asserts that اغار
is a dial. var. of غار; and cites this verse as
authority: and some say اغار وانجد, but when
they do not conjoin the two verbs they say غار;
like as they say هَنَأَنِى الطَّعَامُ وَمَرَأَنِى, but when
they do not conjoin these two verbs they say
أَمْرَأَنِى: (S:) As also mentions another relation
of the second hemistich, commencing اغام [app. a
mistake for أَقَامَ or some other word]: (IKtt:)
