which the subst. is غِيلَةٌ [q. v.]: (K:) [accord. to
the context in the K, in which the meaning is not
clearly indicated, it seems to signify She suckled
her child while being compressed, or while pregnant; like أَغَالَتْ for أَغَالَتْ وَلَدَهَا; and this I
believe to be the right meaning: or] it signifies
she was compressed while suckling a child, or
while pregnant. (TK.)

drink such milk. (TA.)
-A2-  Also Water running
upon the surface of the earth; (S, Mgh, O, Msb,
K;) thus correctly, with fet-h; but ↓ غِيلٌ, with
kesr, is a dial. var. thereof, mentioned by ISd:
(TA:) both are said to signify water running
amid trees: (Ham p. 555:) IB says that the
former signifies thus; and that its pl. is غُيُولٌ:
and it is also said to signify water running in
rivers or rivulets, and in streamlets for irrigation:
(TA:) and by some, to signify water running
amid stones, in the interior of a valley. (Ham
ubi suprà.) It is said in a trad., that in the case
of that [produce] which is irrigated by the water
thus termed (مَا سُقِىَ بَالغَيْلِ, S, Mgh, O, Msb,
TA, or غَيْلًا, Mgh) there shall be [given for the
poor-rate] the tenth; (S, Mgh, O, Msb, TA;)

flowing springs: (K:) or a place in a collection
of tangled, or abundant and dense, trees, in which

(K, TA,) such as a valley and the like: (TA:)
and ↓ غِيلٌ, with kesr, signifies any valley in
which is water; and the pl. of this is أَغْيَالٌ [a pl.
of pauc.] and غُيُولٌ. (K.) ―
-b3-  See also غِيلٌ.
-A3-
Also A plump, full, سَاعِد [or fore arm]; (S, O,
K;) and so ↓ مُغْتَالٌ: (K:) the latter said by
Fr to be applied to a wrist as meaning full
because from الغَوْلُ; but this saying is not valid,
as غَيْلٌ is found in the same sense. (IJ, TA.)
[See an ex. of the former in a verse cited voce
طَفْلٌ.] And A fat, big, boy; as also ↓ مُغْتَالٌ:
(K:) fem. of the former غَيْلَةٌ; (TA;) which is
applied to a woman as meaning fat; (S, K;) or
a fat, big, woman. (AO, TA.) ―
-b2-  See also غَيِّلٌ,
in two places.

(AA, K:) pl. أَغْيَالٌ. (AA, TA.) ―

غِيلٌ A thicket; or trees in a tangled, confused,
or dense, state: (As, S, O:) or an abundance of
such trees, (K, TA,) not thorn-trees, amid which
one may conceal himself: (TA:) and ↓ غَيْلٌ
signifies the same: (K:) and the former, a
collection of reeds or canes, and of [the kind of
high, coarse, grass called] حَلْفَآء: (K:) and i. q.
أَجَمَةٌ [i. e. a collection, or an abundant collection,
of tangled, confused, or dense, trees, or of reeds
or canes]: (S, O, K) [and in like manner ↓ غَيْلَةٌ,
occurring in the Deewán of the Hudhalees, is
expl. by Freytag, as signifying “ saltus: ”] and
the place [meaning covert] of the lion: it may
not have the termination ة: the pl. is غُيُولٌ; (S,
O;) and غَيَايِيلُ is said to be an anomalous pl. of
غِيلٌ. (O and TA in art. عيل, voce عَيَّالٌ, q. v.)
―
-b2-  See also غَيْلٌ, in two places.
غَيْلَةٌ: see غِيلَةٌ. ―
-b2-  Also A single act of
اِغْتِيَال [q. v. voce غِيلَةٌ]. (TA.)
-A2-  See also غِيلٌ.
-A3-  It is also fem. of the epithet غَيْلٌ [q. v.].
(TA.)
غِيلَةٌ and ↓ غَيْلٌ signify the same; (Mgh, O,
Msb); i. e. The compressing one's wife while she
is suckling: (Mgh, Msb:) thus expl. by AO as
stated by A'Obeyd: (Mgh:) and thus the
former signifies accord. to El-'Alkamee; and so
says Málik: or, accord. to El-Munáwee, it signifies the compressing one's wife while she is suckling
or pregnant: or, accord. to ISk, a woman's
suckling while pregnant: (from a marginal note
in a copy of the Jámi' es-Sagheer of Es-Suyootee,
in explanation of a trad. mentioned in what here
follows, commencing with the words لَقَدْ هَمَمْتُ:)
and ↓ غَيْلٌ has this last signification (Mgh, TA)
accord. to Ks: (Mgh:) غِيلَةٌ is the subst. from
اِسْتَغْيَلَتْ: (K:) and IAth says that ↓ غَيْلَةٌ is a
dial. var. thereof; or, as some say, this denotes
a single act [of what is termed غِيلَة]; or the
pronunciation with fet-h is not allowable unless
with the elision of the ة. (TA.) One says,
أَضَرَّتِ الغِيلَةُ بِوَلَدِ فُلَانٍ, meaning His mother's
being compressed while she was suckling him [injured the child of such a one], and likewise his
mother's being pregnant while she was suckling
him. (S, O.) [But] in a trad. is related the
saying, (of the Prophet, O) “ Verily I had
intended to forbid الغِيلَة (S, Mgh, * O, Msb, K)
until I remembered that the Persians and the
Greeks practise it and it does not injure their
children. ” (Mgh, O, Msb.) [See also 4 in art.
فسد.] ―
-b2-  Also The act of deceiving, or beguiling:
(K:) and i. q. ↓ اِغْتِيَالٌ: (S, O, K: [see 8, and
غِيلَةٌ, as expl. in art. غول:]) accord. to Aboo-Bekr,
in the language of the Arabs it signifies the
causing evil, or slaughter, to come to another
from an unknown quarter. (TA.) One says,
قَتَلَهُ غِيلَةً, meaning He deceived, or, beguiled,
him, and went with him, or took him, to a place,
and slew him (S, O, K) when he reached it:
(S, O:) or he slew him at unawares. (Abu-l-
'Abbás, TA.)
-A2-  Also The شَقْشِقَة [or faucial bag
of the he-camel]. (IAar, K.)
أُمُّ غَيْلَانَ [in Pers. مُغَيْلَان] A species of the
[trees called] غِضَاه; (Mgh, Msb;) the [species of
lote-] trees called سِدْر; (S, O, K, TA;) the fruit
of which is said to be sweeter than honey: the
saying, of some, that it is with kesr to the غ,
and that it is thus called because the غِيلان [pl.
of غُولٌ] are often found before it, is rejected and
false: (TA:) Lth and ISh say that it is the
same as the طَلْح [q. v.]. (TA in art. طلح.)
غَيُولٌ, as stated by IJ, on the authority of
Aboo-'Amr Esh-Sheybánee, who had it from his
grandfather, is sing. of غُيُلٌ, (TA,) which is an
epithet applied to oxen, or bulls and cows, (AO,
IJ, O, K, TA, [نَفَرٌ in the CK being a mistake
for بَقَرٌ,]) and to camels, (K,) signifying Numerous: and also [in the K “ or ”] fat. (AO,
IJ, O, K.) ―
-b2-  And, applied to anything, Alone;
solitary: pl. غُيُلٌ. (AA, TA.)
غَيِّلٌ, like سَيِّدٌ, (O, TA,) in the K ↓ غَيْلٌ, but
this latter is said by ISd to be of weak authority,
(TA,) applied to a garment, Wide, or ample.
(O, K, TA.) And so غَيِّلَةٌ applied to a land: (O,
TA: [mentioned also in art. غول:]) or, as some
say, غَيِّلٌ, thus applied, (O, TA,) but accord. to
the context in the K ↓ غَيْلٌ, (TA,) signifies Such
as one judges to be of little extent, though it is
far extending: (O, K, * TA:) and ذَاتُ غَوْلٍ, so
applied, has been mentioned in art. غول as having
this meaning. (TA.) And غَيِّلَةٌ applied to a
woman signifies Tall: (O, TA:) and so does
ذَاتُ غَوْلٍ. (TA in art. غول.)
الغَيَّالُ The lion: (K) or the lion that is in the
غِيل [or covert]. (O.)
غَائِلٌ Much, or abundant, dust or earth. (TA.)
غَائِلَةٌ Rancour, malevolence, malice, or spite,
that is covert, or concealed. (K.) And Evil, or
mischief; as also ↓ مَغَالَةٌ: (S, K:) thus in the
saying فُلَانٌ قَلِيلُ الغَائِلَةِ and ↓ المَغَالَةِ [Such a one
is a person of little evil or mischief]. (S.) ―
-b2-  See
also the same word in art. غول.
أَغْيَلُ Full; big, or large. (TA.)
مُغَالٌ (Mgh, K) and ↓ مُغْيَلٌ (S, Mgh, K) A
