غَضَبٌ an inf. n. of غَضِبَ [q. v.]. (S, Msb, K.)
الغَضَبُ is The contr. of الرِّضَى: (K, TA:) it is
variously defined: some say that it is a state of
excitement of the blood of the heart for the purpose
of revenge: some say that pain on account of
anything reparable is غَضَب; and for anything
irreparable, أَسَف: some say that it [is a passion
which] includes all that is evil; wherefore the
Prophet, to a man who asked of him a precept,
said, لَا تَغْضَبْ: and some say that الغَضَب is [a
passion] accompanied by an eagerness to obtain
revenge; and الغَمّ is accompanied by despair of
obtaining it: (TA: [see also غَيْظٌ:]) there is a
غَضَب that is commended, and a غَضَب that is
discommended; the former being that which is
for the sake of religion and truth, or right; and
the latter being that which is in a wrong case:
and the غَضَب of God is his disapproving of the
conduct of him who disobeys Him, and whom He
will therefore punish. (Ibn- 'Arafeh, TA.)
