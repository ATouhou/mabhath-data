غرنقغَرْنَقَةٌ An amorous playing with the eyes. (Ibn-
'Abbád, O, K.)
غِرْنَاقٌ: see غُرْنَيْقٌ, last sentence.
غُرْنُوقٌ is held by the author of the K to be
wrongly mentioned by J in art. غرق, on the
ground of the saying that the ن is radical; and
IJ says that Sb has mentioned غُرْنَيْقٌ among
quadriliteral-radical words: but there is a difference of opinion on this point; for AHei
asserts that the ن in غُرْنُوقٌ and in all its dial.
vars. is augmentative. (TA.) ―

places. ―
-b3-  Also sing. of غَرَانِقُ, which signifies
(assumed tropical:)  Certain trees: (Aboo-Ziyád, O, K:) or, as also

sprouts at the root, or lower part, of the عَوْسَج

of the neck. ” (O, TA.)

the Prophet that [when he was reciting the words
of the Kur (liii. 19 and 20), “Have ye considered

third? ”] the Devil put into his mouth the saying تِلْكَ الغَرَانِيقُ العُلَى [Those are the most high
غرانيق, as though meaning cranes, for the Numidian crane is remarkable in the East for its
superlatively-high flight]; referring, as IAar
says, to the idols, which were asserted to be
intercessors with God, wherefore they are likened
to the birds that rise high into the sky: (O, TA: *)

sings. expl. in what here follows [but applied to
females]. (O.) ―
