غد1
غُدَّ and
غَدَّ, said of a camel: see 4.
2
غُدِّدَ: see 4.
-A2-  غَدَّدَ, inf. n. تَغْدِيدٌ, He took
his [غُدَّة, i. e.] lot, portion, or share. (K.)
4
أَغَدَّ (S, A, O, L, Msb, K) and أُغِدَّ, (O, L,
K,) and ↓ غُدَّ, (Az, O, L, K,) this last heard by
Az from the Arabs, (L,) [in the CK ↓ غَدَّ, but
(though the phrase غُدَّتْ إِبِلُهُمْ occurs there afterwards) غُدَّ may be less correct than غَدَّ, for the
part. n. of the former was disallowed by As,] and
↓ غُدِّدَ, (Az, O, K,) He (a camel) had the disease
termed غُدَّة [q. v.]; (Az, S, O, L, Msb, K;) or
had غُدَد [pl. of غُدَّةٌ] between the flesh and the
skin. (L.) ―
-b2-  Hence, (A,) أَغَدَّ signifies also (tropical:)  He
(a man, As, S, A, O) was, or became, angry, (As,
S, O, L,) or swollen by reason of anger, as though
he were a camel having the disease termed غُدَّة:
(A:) and أَغَدَّ عَلَيْهِ he was angry with him; (K;)
or he swelled against him and was angry with
him. (L.) ―
-b3-  And أَغَدَّ القَوْمُ The people, or party,
had their camels affected with the disease termed
غُدَّة. (S, O, L, K.)
غَدٌ: see art. غدو.
غُدَّةٌ (IDrd, S, O, L, Msb, K) and ↓ غُدَدَةٌ (S,
O, L, K) [A ganglion; i. e.] any hard lump in
the tendinous parts; (L, K;) [a lump of] flesh
arising from disease, between the skin and the flesh,
which may be made to move about: (Msb:) and
any small nodous lump (عُقْدَة) in the body (IDrd,
O, L, K) of a man, (IDrd, O, L,) surrounded by
fat: (IDrd, O, L, K:) pl. غُدَدٌ [properly pl. of
غُدَّةٌ, and also a coll. gen. n. of which غُدَدَةٌ is the
n. un.]: (S, O, L, Msb, K:) غُدَّةٌ [is applied in
the present day to a ganglion: and a bubo: and
a wen: and all these may be meant by its being
said that it] also signifies a [swelling such as is
termed] سِلْعَة, (L, K,) overspread by fat. (L.)
―
-b2-  And غُدَّةٌ signifies likewise The plague, or
pestilence, (طَاعُون,) in camels; (As, S, O, L, K;)
as also ↓ غَدَدٌ: (K:) or the same in camels as the
طاعون in man: (Msb:) it attacks them in the
groins, and seldom do they recover from it: (L:)
or it is only in the belly; (K, TA;) and when it
extends to the camel's نَحْر [or part where he is
stabbed, or stuck, when he is slaughtered], and
to his groin, or arm-pit, the epithet دَابِرٌ [so in the
TA, but in the O دَارِئٌ, which I believe to be the
right reading,] is applied to him: so says IAar:
(TA:) or it is also in the fat parts; (Lth, O, L;)
and between the flesh and the skin. (L.) ―
-b3-  And
What is between the fat and the hump [of the
camel]. (K.)
-A2-  Another signification of غُدَّةٌ is
A part, or portion, of property; (L, K;) as in
the saying, عَلَيْهِ غُدَّةٌ مِنْ مَالٍ [He owes a part,
or portion, of some property]: (L:) pl. غَدَائِدُ,
(L, K,) and, in some of the copies of the K, غِدَادٌ.
(TA.) And [these two pls.] غَدَائِدُ and غِدَادٌ
signify also Lots, portions, or shares: (L, K:)
thus, accord. to Fr, the former of them means in
a verse of Lebeed cited and expl. voce عَدِيدَةٌ;
but the reading better known is عَدَائِدُ: accord.
to Az, غَدَائِدُ in this instance signifies redundances. (L.)
غَدَدٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
غُدَدَةٌ: see غُدَّةٌ. ―
-b2-  [The pl.] غَدَدَاتٌ is expl. by
AHeyth as signifying Redundances of fatness:
and redundances of goodly [fur, such as is termed]
وَبَر. (L.)
غَادٌّ: see مُغِدٌّ, in two places.
مُغَدٌّ: see the paragraph here following.
مُغِدٌّ A camel having the disease termed غُدَّةٌ;
(As, Az, S, O, L, K;) as also ↓ مُغَدٌّ (L) and
↓ مَغْدُودٌ, (Az, L, K,) or this is not said, (As, O,
K,) but it was heard by Az from the Arabs, (O,
L,) and ↓ مُغَدَّدٌ (Az, L) and ↓ غَادٌّ: (O, L, K:)
مُغِدٌّ, without ة, is also applied to a she-camel:
and its pl. is مَغَادُّ: (L:) the pl. of ↓ غَادٌّ is غِدَاذٌ.
(O, L, K. *) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] (tropical:)  An angry man: (As,
S, L:) or swollen by reason of anger, (A, L,) as
though he were a camel having the disease termed
غُدَّة. (A.) One says, رَأَيْتُ فُلَانًا مُغِدًّا and
↓ مُسْمَغِدًّا (tropical:)  I saw such a one swollen with
anger. (L.)
مُغَدَّدٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
مِغْدَادٌ (assumed tropical:)  A man, (S, O, L, K,) and a woman,
(O, L, K,) much, or often, in anger: (S, O, L,
K:) or always angry: (O, K:) or angry in disposition or nature. (O, L.)
مَغْدُودٌ: see مُغِدٌّ.
مُسْمَغِدٌّ: see مُغِدٌّ.
