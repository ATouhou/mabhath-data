of musk and ambergris and camphor and oil of
ben: (KL:) it is said that the first who called it
thus was Suleymán Ibn-'Abd-El-Melik; (S, TA;)
and he did so because it is a compound boiled
together upon the fire: or it was thus named by
Mo'áwiyeh; the case being, that 'Abd-Allah Ibn-Jaafar went in to him, and the odour of perfume
was diffusing itself from him; so he said, “What
is thy perfume, O 'Abd-Allah? ” and he answered,
“ musk and ambergris combined with oil of ben; ”
whereupon Mo'áwiyeh said, غَالِيَةٌ, meaning highpriced: (TA:) [hence some hold the word to
belong to art. غلو; and their opinion is strengthened by the fact that] غَلْوَى signifies the same.
