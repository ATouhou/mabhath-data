mentioned above on the authority of the K, the
following saying, of a certain Arab, is cited:
أَسْأَلُكَ الغَفِيرَهْ وَالنَّاقَةَ الغَزيِرَهْ وَالعِزَّ فِى العَشِيرَهْ فَإِنَّهَا

meaning He experienced a return of his desire,
(K, TA,) after consolation. (TA.) ―

IAmb allows it to be in the nom. case, on the
condition that هُم is understood [before it; i. e.,
the complete phrase being جَاؤُوا هُمُ الجَمَّآءُ الغَفِيرُ]:
and Ks says that the Arabs put الجمّاء الغفير in
the accus. case فِى التَّمَامِ [i. e. in the case of its

by the mention of the agent. as when you say
جَآءَ القَوْمُ الجَمَّآءَ الغَفِيرَ], and in the nom. case
فِى النُّقْصَانِ [i. e. in the case of its occurring

the agent, as when you say جَآءَ الجَمَّآءُ الغَفيِرُ].

[O my people, there is not in them any disposition
