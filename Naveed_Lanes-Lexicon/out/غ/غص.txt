غص1
غَصَّ, (Msb, MF,) sec. pers. غَصِصْتَ, (S,
Msb, K,) and غَصَصْتَ, (Msb, K,) the latter extr.,
(TA, [see 1 in art. عض,]) aor. يَغَصُّ, (S, Msb, K,)
when the sec. pers. of the pret. is غَصِصْتَ, (Msb,)
and يَغُصُّ, (Msb, TA,) when the sec. pers. of the
pret. is of the other form mentioned above, (Msb,)
inf. n. غَصَصٌ, (S, K,) or غَصٌّ, (Msb,) or the
former when the aor. is يَغَصُّ, and the latter when
the aor. is يَغُصُّ, (TA,) His throat, or fauces, became choked, or obstructed, (S, K, MF,) by food:
(S, Msb, MF:) [as also, app., ↓ اِغْتَصَّ:] accord.
to some of those skilled in the science of lexicology,
you say غَصَّ when it is by food, and شَرِقَ when
it is by beverage, [or by the spittle, and water,
and the like, (see art. شرق,)] and شَجِىَ when it
is by a bone, and جَرِضَ when it is with spittle;
but every one of these is sometimes used in the
place of any other: (MF:) and [thus] you say
also, غَصَّ بِالمَآءِ, meaning, his throat, or fauces,
became choked, or obstructed, by the water; or
the water stopped therein, and he was hardly able
to swallow it. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] غَصَّ بِرِيقِهِ [lit.,
His throat, or fauces, became choked by his spittle;]
meaning, (tropical:)  he died. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Hence, also, غَصَّ
بِالغَيْظِ (tropical:)  [He was, or became, choked with wrath,
or rage]. (Msb.) ―
-b4-  [And غَصَّ, alone, seems to
signify (assumed tropical:)  He became grieved, or disquieted in mind;
like as does شَجِىَ (q. v.): and it seems to be
indicated in the CK that ↓ اغتصّ signifies the
same: see غُصَّةٌ.] ―
-b5-  [Hence also,] غَصَّتْ بِنَا
الأَرْضُ (assumed tropical:)  The land became straitened [as though it
were choked] by us. (TA.) And غَصَّ المَجْلِسُ
بِأَهْلِهِ (assumed tropical:)  [The sitting-place became straitened, or
choked, or choked up, by its people]; as also
↓ اغتصّ. (TA.)

اغصّهُ, (S, Msb, TA,) inf. n. إِغْصَاصٌ, (TA,)
He (a man, S, Msb) caused his throat, or fauces,
to be choked, or obstructed, (S,) by food; (Msb;)
syn. أَشْجَاهُ [which has the above-mentioned meaning and also another to he found below]. (TA.)
[And It (food &c.) choked him.] ―
-b2-  Hence, اغصّهُ
بِالغَيْظِ (tropical:)  [He (a man) caused him to become choked
with wrath, or rage]. (Msb.) ―
-b3-  [Hence also,]
اغصّهُ بِرِيقِهِ [lit., He caused his throat, or fauces,
to become choked by his spittle;] meaning, (assumed tropical:)  He
caused him to become grieved, or disquieted in
mind; (A, TA;) [like أَشْجَاهُ: and it seems to
be indicated in the CK that اغصّهُ without any
addition signifies the same: see غُصَّةٌ.] ―
-b4-  [Hence
also,] اغصّ عَلَيْنَا الأَرْضَ (assumed tropical:)  He made strait to us
the land. (K, TA.)

إِغْتَصَ3َ see 1, in three places.
غُصَّةٌ A thing lying across in the throat, or
fauces, so as to cause a choking, or an obstruction,
thereof; (IDrd, A, * K;) a thing by which one
has his throat, or fauces, choked, or obstructed;
(TA;) food by which one has his throat, or
fauces, choked, or obstructed; (Msb;) i. q. شَجًا;
(S, K;) [which has another meaning that will be
found below; and both these meanings may be
intended by it in the S; but in the K, the latter
only seems to be intended; for there, between it
and the explanation which is here first given, we
find intervening the pl., and also, in the CK, the
words وَقَدْ اَغْصَصْتُهُ فاغْتَصَّ;] a thing by which one
is choked (شَجًا يُغَصُّ بِهِ, Lth, JK, TA) in the
حَرْقَدَة [meaning the head of the windpipe], (Lth,
TA,) or in the throat, or fauces: (JK:) pl. غُصَصٌ.
(S, Msb, K.) It is said in the Kur [lxxiii. 13],
وَطَعَامًا ذَا غُصَّةٍ (TA) And food that sticks fast,
(Bd,) or by which one is choked, (Jel,) in the
throat, or fauces. (Bd, Jel.) ―
-b2-  And hence,
(tropical:)  Choking wrath or rage. (Msb.) ―
-b3-  [And
(assumed tropical:)  Grief, or disquietude of mind; a signification
often occurring; and app. intended by the explanation شَجًا in the K. See what is said on this
point above.] ―
-b4-  Hence also, غُصَصُ المَوْتِ [The
chokings, or strangulations, of death: the deathrattles: or (assumed tropical:)  the agonies of death]. (TA.)
غَصَّان: see what next follows.
غَاصٌّ A man having his throat, or fauces,
choked, or obstructed, (S, Msb, * K,) by food;
(S, Msb;) as also ↓ غَصَّان. (S [in two copies of
which it is written غَصَّانُ], K [in two copies of
which it is written غَصَّانٌ], Msb [in my copy of
which, as well as in the TA, it is without any
final syll. sign].) ―
-b2-  And [hence,] غَاصٌّ بِالقَوْمِ
(assumed tropical:)  An abode, or a place of alighting, filled [and as
it were choked up] with the company of men;
(S, A, K;) and in like manner a mosque; as
