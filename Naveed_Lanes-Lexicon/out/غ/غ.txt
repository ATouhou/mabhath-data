غalphabetical letter
غ
The nineteenth letter of the alphabet: called غَيْنٌ.
It is one of the letters termed حَلْقِيَّة [or faucial],
(L, TA,) its place of utterance being the upper
part of the fauces, near to that of ح, (TA in art.
غين,) the same place as that of خ, (L, TA,)
[from which it differs in being pronounced with
the voice, for] it is of the letters termed مَجْهُورَة
[or vocal], (L, TA, and K in art. غين,) and of
those that are termed مُسْتَعْلِيَة [q. v.]; one should
not reiterate the voice in uttering it, so as to exceed what is right, nor neglect exactness in respect
of its place of utterance, so as to render it obscure,
but should make it thoroughly distinct, and clear:
it is not an augmentative letter: and [it is said
that] it is not substituted [for another letter]:
(K in art. غين:) [but this is a mistake; for] it
is substituted for two letters; for خ, in غَطَرَ بِيَدِهِ,
aor. يَغْطِرُ, meaning خَطَرَ, aor. يَخْطِرُ, mentioned
by IJ and several others, (MF, TA,) and in
غَطَرَ بِذَنَبِهِ for خَطَرَ; (TA in art. خطر;) and for
ع, in لَغَنَّ for لَعَنَّ, mentioned by Ibn-Umm-
Kásim and others, (MF, TA,) [and in نَشُوغٌ for
نَشُوغٌ,] and in اِرْمَغَلَّ for اِرْمَعَلَّ, and also in الغَيْنُ
as signifying “ thirst ” and “ the clouds. ” (TA
in art. غين.)
-A2-  [As a numeral, it denotes A
thousand.]
