غدف1
غَدَفَ لَهُ فِى العَطَآءِ, (aor.
غَدُفَ, inf. n. غَدْفٌ,
TK,) He was profuse to him in giving. (Ibn-
'Abbád, O, K.)
4
اغدفت قِنَاعَهَا She (a woman, S) let down,
or let fall, her [head-covering called] قناع upon
her face. (S, K.) 'Antarah says,
إِنْ تُغْدِفِى دُونِى القِنَاعَ فَإِنَّنِى
طَبٌّ بِأَخْذِ الفَارِسِ المُسْتَلْئِمِ
(S,) i. e. If, O my beloved, thou let down before
me the head-covering, meaning if thou veil thyself
from me, I am expert in capturing the mail-clad
horseman: then how should I lack power to
capture thee? (EM p. 236.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] اغدف
اللَّيْلُ (tropical:)  The night let down its curtains [of darkness]. (S, K.) ―
-b3-  And الشَّبَكَةَ عَلَى الصَّيْدِ
He (a sportsman, or fowler, or the like,) let fall
the net upon the object, or objects, to be captured.
(S, K.) Hence, (TA,) it is said in a trad., إِنَّ
قَلْبَ المُؤْمِنِ أَشَدُّ ارْتِكَاضًا مِنَ الذَّنْبِ يُصِيبُهُ مِنَ
العُصْفُورِ حِينَ يُغْدَفُ بِهِ (S, TA,) i. e. [Verily the
heart of the believer is more vehemently agitated
in consequence of the offence that he purposes than
the sparrow] when the net is made to cover it, whereupon it struggles to escape: (TA:) or مِنَ الخَطِيْئَةِ
[i. e. in consequence of the sin that he is tempted
to commit]. (So in the O, instead of مِن الذنب
يصيبه.) ―
-b4-  اغدف بِهَا (assumed tropical:)  He compressed her, (Ibn-
'Abbád, O, K,) i. e., a woman: (Ibn-'Abbád, O:)
or, as in the A, he went in to her. (TA.) ―
-b5-
اغدف said of the sea [app. from the same verb
said of the night] (tropical:)  It became confusedly agitated
in its waves; expl. by the words اِعْتَكَرَتْ أَمْوَاجُهُ.
(TA.) ―
-b6-  And (assumed tropical:)  He slept. (AA, TA in art.
سدف.) ―
-b7-  And, accord. to Lh, (O,) اغدف said
of the circumciser (O, K, TA) of a boy (O)
means He cut off entirely the prepuce; (O, K,
TA;) like أَسْحَتَ; (O, TA;) but ISd holds
that the latter has this meaning, and the former
means he left somewhat thereof: (TA:) one says
to the circumciser, لَا تُغْدِفْ وَلَا تُسْحِتْ, (O, TA,)
but this means Leave not thou much of the skin,
nor cut off entirely. (TA.)
8
اغتدف مِنْهُ He (a man, O) took from him
(another man, O) much. (Ibn-'Abbád, O, K.)
―
-b2-  And اغتدف الثَّوْبَ He cut the garment, or
piece of cloth. (Ibn-'Abbád, O, K.)
12
اِغْدَوْدَفَ It (the night) came with its darkness. (TA.)
غَدَفٌ A state of ease, and plentifulness, or ampleness: so in the saying, القَوْمُ فِى غَدَفٍ مِنْ
عَيْشِهِمْ (O, K *) or مَعِيشَتِهِمْ (TA) [The people, or
party, are in a state of ease, &c., in respect of
their means of subsistence]: thus in the O and
TS: but in the L, من معيشتهم ↓ فى غُدافٍ.
(TA.)
غُدْفَةٌ A thing in the form of the [head-covering
called] قِنَاع, worn by the women of the Arabs of
the desert. (TA.)
غِدْفَةٌ The apparel of the king. (TA.)
غُدَافٌ The crow, (S, O, K, TA,) or, as some
say, the large crow, (TA,) of the summer, or hot
season: (S, O, K, TA:) or, accord. to some, in
an absolute sense, the crow: (TA:) or the large
crow that is full in the wings: (JK:) or the
black crow: (MA:) pl. غِدْفَانٌ. (S, O.) ―
-b2-  And
A vulture having abundant plumage (S, O, K) is
sometimes thus called: (S, O:) pl. as above.
(K.) ―
-b3-  And Long, (S, O, K, TA,) abundant,
(TA,) black hair. (S, O, K, TA.) ―
-b4-  Also A
black wing. (S, K, TA.) And Anything intensely black is termed غُدَافٌ, and ↓ أَسْوَدُ غُدَافِىٌّ.
(TA.)
-A2-  See also غَدَفٌ.
غُدَافِىٌّ: see the next preceding paragraph.
مغدف, [app. مُغْدِفٌ, or perhaps taken from a
mistranscription for مُغْدِقٌ,] as an epithet applied
to means of subsistence (عَيْشٌ), signifies Smooth
and ample. (TA.) [Freytag mentions مُغَدَّفٌ
and مُغَدَّقٌ, each having the fem. with ة, as signifying Copious, applied to rain: both from the
“ Fákihet el-Khulafà,” p. 141, l. 3; where the
word is مغدقة, evidently مُغْدِقَة, and rhyming
with مُطْبِقَة.]
