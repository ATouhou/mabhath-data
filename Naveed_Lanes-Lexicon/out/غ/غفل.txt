غفل1
غَفَلَ عَنْهُ, (S, O, Msb, K,) aor.
غَفُلَ, (S, O,
Msb,) inf. n. غُفُولٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and غَفْلَةٌ, (S,
O, Msb,) or the latter is a simple subst., (K,) or
it is a simple subst. as well as an inf. n., and so
may be غُفْلَانٌ, said in the K to be a simple subst.;
and MF says that غَفِلَ, aor.
غَفَلَ, of which غَفَلٌ,
mentioned in the K as a subst. syn. with
غَفْلَةٌ, may be the inf. n., has been mentioned
by some as a dial. var. of غَفَلَ, but had not been
found by him in any of the lexicological works
notwithstanding much research, so that its correctness requires consideration; (TA;) He was,
or became, unmindful, forgetful, neglectful, or
heedless, of it, or inadvertent to it; (Msb;)
namely, a thing: (S, O, Msb:) or he neglected
it; and was, or became, unmindful, forgetful,
neglectful, or heedless, of it, or inadvertent to it:
(K:) and sometimes it is used as meaning he
neglected it [intentionally], leaving it, and turning
away: (Msb:) and ↓ اغفلهُ signifies the same as
غَفَلَ عَنْهُ: or غَفَلَ signifies صَارَغَافِلًا [he became
unmindful, forgetful, neglectful, heedless, or inadvertent]: and غَفَلَ عَنْهُ and ↓ اغفلهُ signify وَصَّلَ
غَفْلَتَهُ إِلَيْهِ [which is app. said merely for the purpose of showing that the former verb is made
trans. only by means of عَنْ, and the latter is
trans. without any prep.; for وَصَّلَ الفِعْلَ إِلَى
مَفْعُوِلهِ and أَوْصَلَهُ إِلَيْهِ, which latter phrase is the
more usual, mean “ he made the verb transitive ”]:
(K:) or ↓ اغفلهُ signifies he neglected it (i. e. a
thing) though remembering it. ('Eyn, Sb, S, O,
Msb.) It is said in a trad., مَنِ اتَّبَعَ الصَّيْدَ غَفَلَ
i. e. He who pursues the object of the chase has
his mind busied and possessed by it so that he
becomes unmindful [&c. of other things]. (TA.)
2
غفّلهُ, inf. n. تَغْفِيلٌ, He made him to become

signifies [also] The sufficing one's companion [in
respect of an affair] when he who is the object
thereof is unmindful, unoccupied [in mind, or
actually,] by anything. (ISk, K, TA.) [You
say, غفّل صَاحِبَهُ meaning He sufficed his companion in respect of an affair when he (the latter)
was unmindful, &c.]
-A2-  And غفّلهُ, (Mgh, O, K,
but in my copy of the Mgh written without tesh-deed,) inf. n. as above, (O, K,) He concealed it,
(Mgh, O, K,) namely, a thing. (Mgh, O.)
3

heedless, or inadvertent]. (TA voce سَاهَاهُ, q. v.,

-b2-  [Hence,]
one says, مَا أَغْفَلَهُ عَنْكَ شَيْئًا [app. lit. signifying
How unmindful of thee is he as to anything! and
therefore virtually] meaning dismiss doubt [from
thee respecting him as to anything]. (TA. [See
further explanations of it voce شَىْءٌ.]) ―
-b3-  And
اغفلهُ عَنْهُ He made him to be unmindful, forgetful, neglectful, or heedless, of it, or inadvertent to
it; (S, * O, TA;) namely, a thing. (S.) [Or]
اغفلهُ signifies He, or it, smote him, or lighted on
him, he (the latter) being غَافِل [i. e. unmindful,
&c.]: or he made him to be غَافِل: or he called
him, or named him, غَافِل: and in like manner
↓ غفّلهُ, inf. n. تَغْفِيلٌ: (TA:) or تَغْفِيلٌ signifies
the calling [one] unmindful, &c.: and the rendering [one] stupid, or foolish. (KL.) ―

signifies also He asked him [for, or respecting, a
thing] in the time of his occupation, not waiting

(S, Mgh, O, Msb;) as also عَنْهُ ↓ تغافل, (S, O,)
and ↓ استغفلهُ: (TA:) تغافل [as trans.] in this
sense [without a prep.] is a mistake. (Mgh.)

تغافل He feigned himself unmindful, forgetful, neglectful, heedless, or inadvertent; not being
so really. (Msb.) [And] He was intentionally,

but ↓ تغفّل signifies he was deceived, or circumvented, in a state of unmindfulness, forgetfulness,
&c. (TA.) تغافل عَنْهُ: see 5. It means [also]

to it, and no fine: (O, K:) [or,] accord. to Lh,
one says قِدَاحٌ غُفْلٌ, using the sing. form [of the
epithet] meaning [gaming arrows] in which are
no notches, and to which is assigned no portion
and no fine: they used to be added to give additional weight to the collection of arrows from fear
of occasioning suspicion [of foul play], i. e. to increase the number: and they were four; the first
[called] المُصَدَّرُ; the next, المُضَعَّفُ; the next,
المَنِيحُ; and the next, السَّفِيحُ. (TA.) ―
