غَتْمٌ Intense heat that almost takes away the
breath. (S, K.) A rájiz says, (S,) namely,
Mes'ood Ibn-Keyd [?] El-Fezáree, (TA,) describing camels, (S in art. فل,)
حَرَّقَهَا حَمْضُ بِلَادِ فِلِّ
وَغَتْمُ نَجْمٍ غَيْرِ مُسْتَقِلِّ
[The pasturage termed حمض of tracts of country
not rained upon and not having fresh herbage rendered them thirsty, and the intense and almostsuffocating heat of a star not high (above the
horizon), i. e. not having become high so as to
be concealed by the rays of the sun]; i. e. [a
star] not high (غَيْرِ مُرْتَفِعٍ) because of the constancy
of the heat attributed to it [at the time of its
auroral rising]; the heat becoming intense only
at the time of the [auroral] rising of الشِّعْرَى,
[meaning Sirius, the star to which allusion is
here made,] which is in [correctly after] الجَوْزَآء.

correctness, therein; meaning, in speaking Arabic;

fem. gender]; so says Z; and, accord. to Lh,
الغُتَيْمُ signifies the same, but ISd says, “I know
it not save as from him. ” (TA.) One says, أَوْرَدَهُ
حِيَاضَ غُتَيْم [He brought him to death]: and in
like manner, وَقَعَ فِى أَحْوَاضِ غُتَيْم [He fell into
death], expl. by Lh as meaning he died. (TA.)
