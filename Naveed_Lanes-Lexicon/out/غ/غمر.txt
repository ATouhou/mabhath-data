not like the غُمَر of the rider: salute me in the
beginning of prayer and in the middle thereof and
in the end thereof: meaning that they should not
make the salutation of him to be a thing of no
great importance, and to be postponed: for the
rider puts on his camel his saddle and his travel-ling-provisions, and last of all hangs upon his
saddle his drinking-cup. (IAth, TA.)

TA:) waste land which water does not reach is
not called غَامِرٌ; (S;) but such is called قَفْرٌ.
(Msb.) It is said in a trad., [which shows that
the last two explanations given above are correct,]
that 'Omar imposed a tax of a دِرْهَم and a قَفِيز
