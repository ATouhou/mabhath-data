TA,) in order that he may become lowered: and
by which his judgment, or opinion, is sought to be
made erroneous: (TA:) you say, ↓ مَسْأَلَةٌ غَلُوطٌ;
but when you make the latter word a subst., you
add the ة: (El-Khattábee:) the pl. of أُغْلُوطَةٌ is
أُغْلُوطَاتٌ and أَغَالِيطُ (S) and غَلُوطَاتٌ, which is
formed from the first of these pls. by the suppression of the hemzeh, and is not, as some have
said, pl. of غَلُوطَةٌ. (Hr.) Mohammad forbade
أُغْلُوطَات, (S, TA,) or غَلُوطَات, (TA.) because they
are unprofitable with respect to religion, and
there is scarely, or never, in them aught save
what is unprofitable. (El-'Otbee, TA.)
