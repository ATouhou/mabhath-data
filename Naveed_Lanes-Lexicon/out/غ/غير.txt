said in the Kur [viii. 55], ذٰلِكَ بِأَنَّ اللّٰهَ لَمْ يَكُ مُغَيِّرًا
نِعْمَةً أَنْعَمَهَا عَلَى قَوْمٍ حَتَّى يُغَيِّرُوا مَا بِأَنْفُسِهِمْ [This

غَيْرٌ signifies i. q. سِوًى [Other]: and the pl. is
أَغْيَارٌ: (S:) [but غَيْر itself often has a pl. meaning, as will be seen in what follows:] or [accord.
to general usage, as will be seen below,] غَيْرُ signifies i. q. سِوَى [other than; exclusively of; or
not, as used before a substantive or an adjective].
(Msb, K: in the CK [erroneously] سِوًى.) It is
used to qualify a subst.; [governing (as a prefixed noun) the noun that follows it in the gen.
case;] and when so used, it is put in the same
case as the noun preceding it. (S.) It qualifies
an indeterminate noun: (Mughnee, Msb:) you
say جَآءَنِى رَجُلٌ غَيْرُكَ [A man, other than, or
not, thou, came to me]: (Msb:) and نَعْمَلْ صَالِحًا
غَيْرَ الَّذِى كُنَّا نَعْمَلُ [We will in that case do good,
other than, or not, what we used to do: (Kur
xxxv. 34:)]: (Mughnee:) and مِنْ مَآءٍ غَيْرِ آسِنٍ
[Of water other than, or not, altered in taste and
colour]. (Kur xlvii. 16.) It is a noun necessarily
prefixed, as to the sense, to a noun which it
governs in the gen. case: but sometimes it is
without the latter, when the meaning is understood and it is preceded by لَيْسَ, (Mughnee, K,)
or by لَا: (K:) [in which case it signifies Any
other person or thing; any person or thing beside,
or else:] you say قَبَضْتُ عَشَرَةً لَيْسَ غَيْرُهَا [I received ten; not other than they was received by
me; i. e., not any other thing; or not anything
beside, or else]; (Mughnee, K;) the enunciative,
مَقْبُوضًا, being suppressed: (Mughnee:) and ليس
غَيْرَهَا, (Mughnee, K;) the noun [of ليس] being
understood; i. e., لَيْسَ المَقْبُوضُ غَيْرَهَا: (Mughnee:)
and ليس غَيْرَ; in which the affixed noun [for
المضاف, in the K, I read المضاف اليه, as in the
Mughnee,] is suppressed, and the noun [of ليس]
is also understood: (Mughnee, K:) and ليس غَيْرُ;
(Mughnee, K;) in which, accord. to Mbr, and
the later authors, غير is indecl., being likened to
قَبْلُ and بَعْدُ, so that it may be either the noun
or the enunciative [of ليس] or, accord. to Akh,
it is decl., because it is not a noun of time like
قَبْلُ and بَعْدُ, nor of place like فَوْقُ and تَحْتُ,
but like كُلٌّ and بَعْضٌ, so that it is the noun [of
ليس], and the enunciative is suppressed; (Mughnee;) or it may be either indecl. or decl., (Mughnee, K,) accord. to Ibn-Kharoof: (Mughnee:)
and ليس غَيْرًا, and ليس غَيْرٌ; (Mughnee, K;) in
both which cases it is decl., as though the affixed
noun were mentioned: (Mughnee:) and لَا غَيْرُ;
for the saying, [which we find in the Mughnee,]
app. taken from a statement of Seer, that this is
incorrect, is not good, since it occurs in the following verse, cited by Ibn-Málik;
جَوَابًا بِهِ تَنْجُو اعْتَمِدْ فَوَرَبِّنَا
لَعَنْ عَمَلٍ أَسْلَفْتَ لَا غَيْرُ تُسْأَلُ
[Aim thou at having an answer by which thou
mayest be safe; for, by our Lord, respecting an
action which thou shalt have done before, not any
other thing, or not anything beside or else, thou
wilt be asked]. (K.) ―
-b2-  It does not become
determinate by its being prefixed to another
noun, because it is very vague: but it is also
applied as an epithet to a determinate noun
which is near to being indeterminate; as in صِرَاطَ
الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ غَيْرِ الْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ [The way
of those upon whom Thou hast conferred favour;
the other than, or those who are not, the objects of
anger; (Kur i. 6 and 7;)] because the noun rendered determinate by the art. ال denoting a genus
is near to being indeterminate, and because when
غير occurs between two contraries its vagueness
becomes weakened, (Mughnee, K, *) or altogether
departs: (K:) or it is here applied as an epithet
to a determinate noun because it resembles a determinate noun in its being prefixed to such a
noun: (Msb:) Az says that غير is here in the
gen. case because it is an epithet to الذين; and
that it may be an epithet to [what is technically
termed in this instance] a determinate noun [as
having the article ال prefixed to it] because الذين
has not [in itself] a direct meaning (لِأَنَّ الَّذِينَ
غَيْرُ مَصْمُودٍ صَمْدُهُ), [it being merely a conjunct
noun, the meaning of which is determined by
what follows it,] notwithstanding it has the art.
ال prefixed to it: Abu-l-'Abbás says that Fr holds
الذين to have the office of an indeterminate noun;
and غير to be an epithet of it; not of any other
noun; but that غير, accord. to some, may be an
epithet relating to the nouns implied in انعمت
عليهم, these not having a direct meaning: Akh
says that غير [with what follows] is a substitute
[for الذين with what follows], as though the
meaning were صِرَاطَ غَيْرِ المَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ [the way
of those who are not the objects of anger]. (TA.)
The reading غَيْرَ is also related, on the authority
of Ibn-Ketheer, in the accus. case, as a denotative
of state, [meaning they being not the objects of
anger,] relating to the pronoun governed in the
gen. case by the prep. [in عليهم]; or by أَعْنِى [I
mean] understood; or as an exceptive, [accord.
to a usage to be explained below,] if the favours
be interpreted as conferred in common upon the
two classes of persons. (Bd.) ―
-b3-  As it resembles
a determinate noun in its being prefixed to a determinate noun, [as المغضوب in the above-cited
passage of the Kur,] some have presumed to prefix to it the article ال: but against this it may be
urged, that its prefixion to a determinate noun is
not to render the expression determinate, but for
specification; and ال does not imply specification.
(Msb.) ―
-b4-  In the following verse of Hassán,
أَتَانَا فَلَمْ نَعْدِلْ سِوَاهُ بِغَيْرِهِ
نَبِىٌّ بَدَا فِى ظُلْمَةِ اللَّيْلِ هَادِيَا
the meaning is, [A prophet came to us, who
appeared in the darkness of night, a director in
the right way,] and we did not weigh another
than him with another than the other, i. e., with
him. (Mughnee.) ―
-b5-  [وَغَيْرُ ذٰلِكَ is a phrase of
frequent occurrence, meaning Et cœtera.] ―
-b6-  غَيْرُ
is also used in the sense of لَيْسَ [He, or it, is not];
as in the phrase كَلَامُ اللّٰهِ غَيْرُ مَخْلُوقٍ [The word
of God is not created], syn. لَيْسَ بِمَخْلُوقٍ. (Az,
TA.) ―
-b7-  It is also used in the sense of لَا [meaning Not, as used before a participle]; (S, K;)
and then it is in the accus. case, as a denotative
of state; (S;) as in the phrase فَمَنِ اضْطُرَّ غَيْرَ بَاغٍ,
(S, K,) in the Kur [ii. 168, and other places],
(S,) i. e., جَائِعًا لَا بَاغِيًا [But whosoever is necessitated, being hungry, not transgressing the due
bounds]. (S, K.) ―
-b8-  It is also used as an exceptive, (S, Mughnee,) in the sense of إِلَّا [Except; save; or but]; (Msb, K;) and then it is
put in the same case in which the word following
إِلَّا would be put in the same phrase, (S, Mughnee, Msb, K,) because it is originally a qualificative, and its use as an exceptive is adventitious:
(S:) therefore you say جَآءَ القَوْمُ غَيْرَ زَيْدٍ [The
people came, except Zeyd]; and مَا جَآءَنِى أَحَدٌ غَيْرَ
زَيْدٍ and غَيْرُ زَيْدٍ [Not any one came to me, except
Zeyd]: (Msb, K:) or its case depends upon the
governing words, so that you say مَا قَامَ غَيْرُ زَيْدٍ
[No one stood, except Zeyd], and مَا رَأَيْتُ غَيْرَ زَيْدٍ
[I saw not any, except Zeyd]: (Msb:) but Fr
says that some of the Benoo-Asad and Kudá'ah
put غير in the accus. case, when used in the sense
of إِلَّا, whether the phrase before it be complete or
incomplete; saying مَا جَآءَنِى غَيْرَكَ [Not any one
came to me, except thou], and ما جاءنى أَحَدٌ غَيْرَكَ
[Not any one came to me, except thou]: (S, Msb:)
and AA says that when غير has the place of إِلَّا,
it is put in the accus. case. (Msb.) In the saying لَا إِلٰهَ غَيْرُ اللّٰهِ [There is no deity other than
God], غير is in the nom. case because it is
the enunciative of لا; but it may be put in the
accus. case, as meaning إِلَّا. (Msb.) When, as
an exceptive, it is prefixed to an indecl. word
[and not preceded by a prep.], it may be itself
indecl., with fet-h for its termination; as in the
following verse;
لَمْ يَمْنَعِ الشُّرْبَ مِنْهَا غَيْرَ أَنْ نَطَقَتْ
حَمَامَةٌ فِى غُصُونٍ ذَاتِ أَوْقَالِ
[Nought prevented the drinking from it, except
that a pigeon cooed, upon branches having اوقال,
which app. means stumps of cut shoots]. (Mughnee, K.) [See also an ex. (of غَيْرَ أَنَّ) in a verse
cited voce بَيْدَ.] ―
-b9-  [It is often used with a prep.;
as in بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ Without reckoning; (Kur ii. 208,
&c.;) and مِنْ غَيْرِ سُوْءٍ Without leprosy. (Kur
xx. 23, &c.)]
-A2-  غَيْرٌ (JK, K) and (JK) ↓ غِيَرٌ
(JK, S) signifying The act of altering, or
changing, i. q. تَغْيِيرٌ, (JK,) are substs. from غَيَّرَهُ;
(S with respect to the latter, and K with respect
to the former;) not inf. ns., as having no unaugmented verb. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] الدَّهْرِ ↓ غِيَرُ,
the former of these two words being of the same
measure as عِنَب, The accidents, or casualties, of
time or fortune, which alter, or change, things:
(K:) [or alteration, or change, of time or of
fortune; for] IAmb says, with respect to the
saying لَا أَرَانِى اللّٰهُ بِكَ غِيَرًا [May God not show
me, in thee, alteration of state], that غِيَرٌ is from
تَغَيُّرُ الحَالِ, a subst. like قِطَعٌ [as meaning “ a
portion of the night ”]; or that it may be a pl.,
of which the sing. is ↓ غِيْرَةٌ. (TA.) ―
-b3-  [Hence
also,] بَنَاتُ غَيْرٍ [or ↓ غِيَرٍ, as in Freytag's Arab.
Prov. i. 309,] (tropical:)  Lying: or a lie, or falsehood:
syn. كَذِبٌ: (TS, K:) or [rather] lies. (JK, A.)

غِيرَةٌ A provision of corn, or wheat, &c., which
a man procures for himself; syn. مِيرَةٌ; (S, Msb,
K,) as also ↓ غِيَارٌ: (TA:) [or the latter is probably syn. with مِيرَةٌ used in the sense of an
inf. n.:] pl. of the former غِيَرٌ. (Msb.) [See art.

-b2-
Also A bloodwit; (AA, S, K;) syn. دِيَةٌ: (AA, S: *)

this is a sing., (S, TA,) of the masc. gender;
TA;) and the pl. is أَغْيَارٌ: (S, TA:) and the دِيَة

for retaliation. (TA.)
