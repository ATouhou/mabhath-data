غَرْفٌ and ↓ غَرَفٌ, (S, K,) the latter mentioned
by Yaakoob, (S,) A species of trees, (شَجَرٌ,) with
which one tans; (S, K;) when dry, [said to be]
what are termed ثُمَام: (TA: [but perhaps this
statement applies particularly to غَرَفٌ, which see
below: and see also ثُمَامٌ:]) accord. to A'Obeyd,
called غَرْفٌ and غَلْفٌ [q. v.]: AHn says, the غرف
is a species of trees from which bows are made;
[see عِضَاهٌ;] and no one tans with it; but Kz says
that its leaves may be used for tanning therewith,
though bows be made of its branches: and Aboo-Mohammad mentions, on the authority of As,
that one tans with the leaves of the ↓ غَرَف, and
not with its branches: El-Báhilee says that غَرْفٌ
signifies certain skins, not such as are termed
قَرَظِيَّة, [i. e. not tanned with قَرَظ, but] tanned, in
Hejer, in the following manner: one takes for
them sprigs (هَدَب) of the أَرْطَى, and puts them in
a mortar, and pounds them, then throws upon
them dates, whereupon there comes forth from
them an altered odour, after which a certain
quantity is laded out for each skin, which is then
tanned therewith; and the term غَرْف is applied to
that which is laded out, and to every quantity of
skin from that mash, to one and to all alike: but
Az says, the غَرْف with which skins are tanned is
well known, of the trees of the desert (البَادِيَة), and,
he says, I have seen it; and what I hold is this,
that the skins termed غَرْفِيَّة are thus termed in
relation to the species of trees called the غَرْف, not
to what is laded out: As says that الغَرْفُ, with
the ر quiescent, signifies certain skins that are
brought from El-Bahreyn. (TA.)
غَرَفٌ, (O, K, TA,) accord. to AA, (O,) or
IAar, (T, TA,) i. q. ثُمَامٌ [Panic grass]; (O, K,
TA;) not used for tanning therewith; and accord.
to Az, this that IAar says is correct: AHn says
that when it becomes dry, and one chews it, its
odour is likened to that of camphor: (TA:) or
ثُمَام while green: (K:) or one of the species of
ثُمَام, which resembles rushes (أَسَل,) of which
brooms are made, and with which water-bags of
leather are covered to protect them from the sun
so that the water becomes cool: (A 'Obeyd, TA:)
the n. un. is with ة. (AHn, O.) And, (O, K,)
accord. to Skr, (O,) The شَثّ, and طُبَّاق, and
نَشَم [thus (correctly) in the O, but in the K
بَشَم], and عَفَار [in the CK غَفار], and عُتْم, and
صَوْم, and حَبَج, and شَدْن, and حَيَّهَل [or حَيَّهْل],
and هَيْشَر, and ضُرْم [thus in the O and in some
copies of the K] or ضِرْم [thus in other copies of
the K]: every one of these is called غَرَف. (O, K.)

S, * Mgh, * O, Msb, * K;) as much thereof as fills

(O, K:) before it is so taken it is not termed غُرْفَة:

-b2-  And
الغُرْفَةُ signifies The Seventh Heaven: (S, * O, * K:)

one of the names of Paradise. (Bd in xxv. 75.)
Accord. to the S [and O], the phrase دُونَ غُرْفَةِ

species of tree called غَرْف: (S, O, K:) Aboo-Kheyreh says that the [skins termed] غرفيّة are

AHn, one says ↓ مَزَادَةٌ غَرَفِيَّةٌ and قِرْبَةٌ غَرَفِيَّةٌ; and

cannot be quiescent], cited by As. (TA.) ―
