غَشِمَ, [accord. to the TK,

so smearing. (K.) ―

غشو and غشى
1
غَشِيَهُ, aor. يَغْشَى, inf. n. غَشَاوَةٌ, It covered,
or concealed, him, or it; (TA;) as also ↓ تغشّاهُ.
(MA.) And one says, غَشَانِى اللَّيْلُ, i. e. غَشِيَنِى
[The night covered me, or concealed me: or the
meaning may be that which next follows]. (JK.)
―
-b2-  غَشِيَهُ, (K, TA,) aor. and inf. n. as above, (TA,)
is said of an event (أَمْرٌ), [and of heat, (S and K
in art. دغم,) and of cold, (K in that art.,) and of
an affection of the mind or body, and of various
things, sometimes in like manner of a man, and
of a company of men,] in a similar sense; and so
↓ تغشّاهُ; (K, TA;) both signifying It came upon,
[or invaded, so as to surprise, and so as to over-whelm, properly meaning] as a thing that covered,
him, or it. (K, * TA.) Hence, in the Kur [liii.
16], إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى [When there was
coming upon the lote-tree so as to cover it, or overspread it, what was so coming]. (TA.) And in
the same [xx. 81], فَغَشِيَهُمْ مِنَ الْيَمِّ مَا غَشِيَهُمْ [And
there came upon them so as to overwhelm them, of
the sea, what so came upon them]. (TA.) And
in the same [viii. 11], إِذْ يَغْشَاكُمُ [followed by
االنُّعَاسُ, i. e. When it (drowsiness) was coming
upon you, or overcoming you]; accord. to one
reading; other readings being يُغْشِيكُمُ and
يُغَشِّيكُمُ [followed by النُّعَاسَ]. (TA.) See also
غَاشِيَةٌ, in three places. ―
-b3-  [A somewhat similar
signification of غَشِيَهُ will be found below.] ―
-b4-
One says of the night, يَغْشَى بِظُلْمَتِهِ كُلَّ مَا بَيْنَ
السَّمَآءِ وَالأَرْضِ [It covers, or conceals, with its
darkness, everything that is between the heaven
and the earth]. (Jel in xcii. 1.) And [hence it
is said that] غَشِىَ اللَّيْلُ means The night was, or
became, dark; as also ↓ اغشى. (Msb, TA.) ―
-b5-
[And غَشِيَهُ, and غَشِىَ بَصَرَهُ and ↓ غشّاهُ, signify It,
i. e. light (ضَوْءٌ), came upon him, and upon his eye,
with an overpowering effect, so as to obscure, or
dazzle, his sight.] ―
-b6-  غَشِيَهُ also signifies جَآءَهُ (S)
or أَتَاهُ (Mgh, Msb, K) [which have two meanings, i. e. He came to him, and he did it; both,
perhaps, here meant, for both are well-known
meanings of غَشِيَهُ]; and, thus used, the aor. is as
above, (TA,) and the inf. n. is غَشَيَانٌ, (S, TA,)
or غِشْيَانٌ, (so in one of my copies of the S,) or the
subst. is ↓ غِشْيَانٌ, (Msb,) with kesr, (Mgh, Msb,)
syn. with إِتْيَانٌ. (Mgh.) You say, غَشِىَ فُلَانًا He
came to such a one; syn. أَتَاهُ; as also غَشَاهُ, aor.
يَغْشُوهُ. (K.) ―
-b7-  [Hence,] غَشِيَهَا, (S, MA, Msb,
K,) inf. n. غَشَيَانٌ or غِشْيَانٌ, (accord. to different
copies of the S,) or the latter and غَشْىٌ, (MA,)
or ↓ غِشْيَانٌ is the subst. in this case also, (Msb,)
and syn. with إِتْيَانٌ, metonymically used in the
sense of جِمَاعٌ, (Mgh, Msb,) (tropical:)  He compressed her;
(S, MA, Msb, K;) namely, a woman; (MA, K;)
as also ↓ تغشّاها. (MA, Msb, TA.) ―
-b8-  And غَشِىَ
إِلَيْهِ مَحْجَرًا He did to him (أَتَى إِلَيْهِ) a forbidden
action. (TA in art. حجر.) [Hence,] ↓ غِشْيَانُ
المَحَارِمِ [The doing of forbidden things]. (Mgh
and Msb and K in art. رهق.) And غَشِىَ الشَّىْءَ
He occupied himself with the thing, engaged in it,
or personally managed or conducted it; syn. لَابَسَهُ
and بَاشَرَهُ. (JM.) [And ↓ تغشّى has a similar
meaning; for it is said that] التَّغَشِّى and الغَشْىُ
primarily signify الإِتْيَانُ and المُلَابَسَةُ: and they
took an extended range in using the former, so
that one said, بِالعَدْلِ ↓ تَغَشَّاهُمْ or بِالْجَوْرِ [app.
meaning He ruled them with equity or with injustice]. (Ham p. 27.) [And one says, يَغْشَى
الحُرُوبَ (see Ham p. 27), meaning He plunges
into wars, or battles: see مُغَامِسٌ, and its verb.]
―
-b9-  One says also, غَشِيَهُ بِالسَّوْطِ, (K, in which it
is said to be like رَضِيَهُ, and so accord. to some
copies of the S, the phrase in these being غَشِيَتُ
الرَّجُلَ بِالسَّوْطِ,) or بِهِ ↓ غَشَّاهُ, (accord. to other
copies of the S, the verb in these being written
غَشَّيْتُ, and thus accord. to an explanation of قَنَّعَ
رَأْسَهُ بِالسَّوْطِ in art. قنع in the K,) He struck him
(i. e. a man, S) with the whip; he flogged him.
(S, K.)
-A2-  غُشِىَ عَلَيْهِ, (S, MA, Mgh, Msb, K,)
inf. n. غَشْىٌ, (S, Mgh, * K,) or غُشْىٌ, (MA,) or
both, (Msb,) and غَشَيَانٌ, (K, TA, and so in some
copies of the S,) or غِشْيَانٌ, (so in other copies of
the S,) and ↓ غَشْيَةٌ, (S, Mgh,) or this last is an
inf. n. of un., (Msb,) or it is the subst., (K,) He
swooned, i. e. became senseless: (MA, PS:) or i. q.
أُغْمِىَ عَلَيْهِ [q. v.]: (K, TA:) or الغَشْىُ, or الغُشْىُ,
is a state of inertness (تَعَطُّل, Mgh, Msb) of the
motive and sensitive faculties, (Mgh,) or of the
motive faculties and of the sensitive will, (Msb,)
on account of the weakness of the heart, (Mgh,
Msb,) and the soul's becoming drawn together
thereto by a cause that suppresses it (يُخْفِيهِ)
within so that it finds not a place of passage, and
of the causes thereof is a strangling [or stifling], or
hurtful, cold repletion, or vehement hunger, (Mgh,)
or vehement pain, (Mgh, Msb,) or cold, or excessive hunger, (Msb,) or an evil affection in some
associate, or participating, organ, such as the
heart and the stomach: (Mgh:) some say that
it is the same as الإِغْمَآءُ [for which see its proper
art.]; (Mgh, Msb;) thus say the scholastic theologians: (Mgh:) others (the physicians and the
lawyers, Mgh) make a difference between these
two terms. (Mgh, Msb.)
2
غَشَّيْتُ الشَىْءَ, (S, Msb,) inf. n. تَغْشِيَةٌ, (S,)
I covered the thing; put a cover, or covering,
upon it, or over it. (S, Msb.) One says, غَشَّى
اللّٰهُ عَلَى بَصَرِهِ, inf. n. as above; and ↓ اغشى; (K,
TA;) i. e. God put a covering upon, or over, his
eyes. (TA.) And hence, (TA,) it is said in the
Kur [xxxvi. 8], فَهُمْ لَا يُبْصِرُونَ ↓ فَأَغْشَيْنَاهُمْ And
we have put a covering over them [so that they
shall not see]. (S, TA.) ―

inf. n. voce شِينٌ.] ―

former half. ―
-b4-  See also 4. ―
-b5-  غشّاهُ بِالسَّوْطِ: see
1, latter half. ―
-b6-  One says also, غَشَّيْتُهُ سَيْفًا, or
سَوْطًا, [in my original غشيته, without any syll.
sign, but app. as I have written, for I do not
find any instance of غَشِىَ as doubly trans., meaning I equipped him with a sword, or a whip,] like
the saying كَسَوْتُهُ سَيْفًا, or عَمَّمْتُهُ. (TA.)
4
اغشاهُ إِيَّاهُ and ↓ غشّاهُ He made it to cover it;
or to be a cover, or covering, upon it, or over it.
(MA, * TK, and Bd * and Jel * in vii. 52, &c.)
―
-b2-  And [hence,] both signify He made it, i. e. an
event (أَمْر), to come upon, [or invade, so as to
surprise, or so as to overwhelm, properly meaning]
as a thing that covered, him, or it. (K, * TA,)
Both of these verbs are used in this sense in the
Kur-án accord. to different readings in vii. 52 and
xiii. 3, and likewise (as mentioned in the first
paragraph of this art., q. v.,) in viii. 11. (TA.)
―
-b3-  Also, the former, He made him, or it, to
come to him. (S, MA, TA.) ―
-b4-  See also 2, in
two places. ―

without a preposition,] He covered himself with

اِسْتَغْشَوْا ثِيَابَهُمْ means they put their garments as
a covering over their ears; and is a phrase denoting the refusing to hearken; or, as some say,
