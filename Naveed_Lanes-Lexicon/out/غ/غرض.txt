غرض1
غَرِضَ, aor.
غَرَضَ, (S, K,) inf. n. غَرَضٌ, (S, A,
K,) He was vexed, or disquieted by grief, and by
distress of mind; he was grieved, and distressed in
mind: he was disgusted; he turned away with
disgust. (S, A, K.) You say, غَرِضَ مِنْهُ He was
vexed by, or at, him, or it, and disquieted by grief,
and by distress of mind; he was grieved, and distressed in mind, by him, or it: (Mgh in art. غرض,
and TA:) he was disgusted with it, or at it; he
turned away from it with disgust: (Mgh:) and
he feared him, or it. (Ibn-'Abbád, K, TK: but the
first and second mention only the inf. n. of the
verb in this last sense.) And غَرِضَ بِالمُقَامِ, aor.
and inf. n. as above, [He was vexed, &c., by continuance, stay, residence, or abode, in a place: he
was disgusted with it, or at it.] (S.) And إِذَا
فَاتَهُ الغَرَضُ فَتَّهُ الغَرَضُ i. e. الضَّجَرُ [When the
object of aim, or endeavour, escapes him, so that
he cannot attain it, vexation, or disquietude by
grief, and by distress of mind, or disgust, crushes
him]. (A, TA.) ―
-b2-  And hence, (A,) aor. as
above, (K,) and so the inf. n., (A, TA,) He
yearned, or longed: (S, A, K:) or he yearned,
or longed, vehemently, or intensely: (TA:) إِلَيْهِ
for him, or it: (S:) or إِلَى لِقَائِهِ for meeting
with him: the verb in this sense being made
trans. by means of الى because it imports the
meaning of اِشْتَاقَ and حَنَّ [which are made
trans. by the same means]: (A, TA:) [for]
accord. to Akh, غَرِضْتُ إِلَيْهِ signifies غَرِضْتُ مِنْ
هٰؤُلآءِ إِلَيْهِ [I turned with vexation, or disgust,
from these, to him, or it]; because the Arabs
connect the verb [with its objective complement]
by means of all these particles [mentioned above;
namely, ب and من and الى]. (S.) Mbr reckons
غَرَضٌ, as meaning both “ being disgusted ” and
“ yearning ” or “ longing,” among words having
contrary significations; and so does Ibn-Es-Seed;
(MF;) and in like manner, IKtt. (TA.) [Perhaps these derive the latter meaning from غَرَضٌ
signifying “ a butt,” or “ an object of aim,” &c.]
-A2-  غَرَضَ عَنْهُ, (TA,) [in the TK غَرَضَهُ,] inf. n.
غَرْضٌ, (Ibn-'Abbád, K,) He (a man, TA) refrained, forbore, abstained, or desisted, from him,
or it; left, relinquished, or forsook, him, or it.
(Ibn-'Abbád, * K, * TA.)
-A3-  غَرُضَ, aor.
غَرُضَ, inf. n.
غِرَضٌ, It (a thing) was fresh, juicy, moist, not
flaccid. (S, K.)
-A4-  غَرَضَ الشَّىْءَ, aor.
غَرِضَ, (K,)
inf. n. غَرْضٌ; (TA;) and ↓ غرّضهُ, (K,) inf. n.
تَغْرِيضٌ; (TA;) He plucked the thing while it
was fresh, juicy, moist, or not flaccid: or he took
it (أَخَذَهُ, in some copies of the K جَذَّهُ, which is
a mistake, TA) while it was so. (K.) ―
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  He
did the thing hastily, or hurriedly, before its time;
syn. أَعْجَلَهُ عَنْ وَقْتِهِ. (Ibn-'Abbád, O, TS, K. *)
―
-b3-  غَرَضَ السَّخْلَ, (S, K,) aor. and inf. n. as
above; (TA;) and ↓ غرّضها; (K;) (assumed tropical:)  He weaned
the lambs, or kids, before their time. (ISk, S, K.)
―
-b4-  غَرَضَتْ سِقَآءَهَا, (S, K,) aor. and inf. n. as
above, (S,) (assumed tropical:)  She (a woman, S) churned, or
agitated, the contents of her milk-skin, and when
its butter had formed in little clots but had not
collected together, she poured out the milk, and
gave it to people to drink. (ISk, S, K. *) ―
-b5-
غَرَضْتُ لَهُ غَرِيضًا (tropical:)  I gave him to drink fresh milk.
(TA.) ―
-b6-  غَرَضْتُ لِلضَّيْفِ غَرِيضًا (tropical:)  I fed the guests
with food that had not been kept through the
night: so in the A: but in the K, لَهُمْ ↓ أَغْرَضَ
غَرِيضًا (tropical:)  he kneaded for them fresh dough, and did
not feed them with food that had been kept
through the night. (TA.)
-A5-  غَرَضَهُ, aor.
غَرِضَ, [inf. n.
غَرْضٌ,] also signifies He filled it, namely, a
vessel, (S, K,) and a skin, and a wateringtrough; (TA;) and so ↓ اغرضهُ. (K.) ―
-b2-  And
He stopped short of filling it completely. (S, K.
[See also 2.]) Thus it has two contr. significations. (S, K.) A rájiz says,
لَقَدْ فَدَى أَعْنَاقَهُنَّ المَحْضُ
وَالدَّأْظُ حَتَّى مَا لَهُنَّ غَرْضُ
(S, TA,) i. e. Verily the محض and the دأظ [the
pure milk and the fatness and fulness so that there
is no deficiency in their skins] have ransomed them
from being slaughtered and sold. (TA.) [But see
غَرْضٌ below.] ―
-b3-  Also, aor.
غَرِضَ, inf. n. غَرْضٌ, He
broke it (i. e. a thing) without separating it. (TA.)
-A6-  غَرَضَ البَعِيرَ, (S,) or النَّاقَةَ, (K,) [aor.
غَرِضَ, as
appears from the word مَغْرِضٌ, for otherwise, by
rule, it would be مَغْرَضٌ,] inf. n. غَرْضٌ, (K,) He
bound the غَرْض upon the camel; (S;) as also
↓ اغْتِرضهُ; (TA;) or he bound the she-camel with
the غُرْضَة, (K,) or غَرْض; (TA;) as also ↓ أَغْرَضَهَا;
(K;) and in like manner, غَرَضَ البَغِيرَ بِالغَرْضِ.
(TA.)
2
غرّض, inf. n. تَغْرِيضٌ, He ate fresh flesh-meat. (K.) ―
-b2-  See also غَرَضَ, in two places.
-A2-
One says also, غَرِّضْ فِى سِقَائَكَ Fill not thy skin
[completely; leave a portion unfilled in thy skin].
(S.) ―
-b2-  And فُلَانٌ بَحْرٌ لَا يُغَرَّضُ i. e. [Such a one
is a sea] that will not become exhausted. (S, A, TA.)
-A3-  And غرّض signifies also تَفَكَّهَ, (K, TA.)
[meaning He affected jesting, or joking, for it
is] said in the I. to be from الفُكَاهَةُ signifying
المُزَاحُ. (TA.)
3
غارض إِبِلَهُ (tropical:)  He brought his camels to the
watering-place early in the morning; in the first
part of the day. (A, O, K.)
4
اغرضهُ He made him to be vexed, or disquieted

-A3-  اغرض النَّاقَةَ:
see 1, last sentence.
-A4-  اغرض He (a man) hit, or
attained, the غَرَض [i. e. the butt, or object of aim,
&c.]. (IKtt.)
5
تغرّض, (K, TA,) thus in the O, on the
authority of Ibn-'Abbád; but accord. to the Tekmileh, ↓ انغرض; (TA;) said of a branch, It broke
without breaking in pieces: (K, TA:) or, accord.
to the L, the latter signifies It bent and broke
without becoming separated. (TA.)
7
إِنْغَرَضَ see what next precedes.
8
اِغْتَرَضَ: (so in a copy of the A: [and if this
be correct, the primary signification seems to be
It (a thing) was plucked, or taken, while it was
fresh, juicy, moist, or not flaccid: quasi-pass. of
غَرَضَ in the first of the senses assigned to it as a
trans. v. above:]) or اُغْتَرِضَ: (so in the JK and
TA: [and if this be correct, it is app. formed
by transposition from اُغْتُضِرَ:]) (tropical:)  He died in his
fresh state; (JK;) [i. e.] he died a youth, or
a young man: [the latter reading seems to be
the right, for it is said to be] similar to اُحْتُضِرَ
[evidently a mistranscription for اُخْتُضِرَ]. (A,
TA.)
-A2-  اغترض الشَّىْءَ He made the thing his
غَرَض [i. e. butt, or object of aim, &c.]. (TA.)

pl. of pauc.] (IB) and غُرُوضٌ [a pl. of mult.]:
and of the latter, ↓ غُرْضٌ, [or rather this is a coll.
gen. n.,] (S, K,) like as بُسْرٌ is of بُسْرَةٌ, (S,) and
غُرُضٌ. (S, K.) [Hence the saying of Mohammad,] غُرْض shall not be bound [upon camels by
pilgrims] except to three mosques; the sacred
mosque [of Mekkeh], and my mosque [of ElMedeeneh], and the mosque [El-Aksà] of Beytel-Makdis [or Jerusalem]. (TA.)
-A2-  غَرْضٌ also
signifies (accord. to some, in the verse cited in
the first paragraph, S, TA) The place of what
thou hast left (مَوْضِعُ مَا تَرَكْتَهُ, not ماء [i. e. not
مَآءٍ] as written in the S [and K], TA,) and not
put into it anything: (S, K, TA:) and is said

i. e. غُرُورِهِ [I folded the garment, or piece of cloth,
according to its first, or original, foldings.] (Ibn-
'Abbád, Z, Sgh, K.)
عُرْضٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
غَرَضٌ A butt, a mark, or an object of aim, at
which one shoots, or throws; (S, O, Msb, K;) a
thing that thou settest up (مَا أَمْثَلْتَهُ) to shoot or
throw at: (IDrd:) pl. أَغْرَاضٌ. (Msb, K.) It is
said in a trad., لَا تَتَّخِذُوا شَيْئًا فِيهِ الرَّوحُ غَرَضًا [Ye
shall not take a thing in which is the vital principle as a butt]. (TA.) And hence one says,
النَّاسُ أَغْرَاضُ المَنِيَّةِ (assumed tropical:)  [Mea are the butts of destiny,
or of death]: and جَعَلْتَنِى غَرَضًا لِشَتْمِكَ (assumed tropical:)  [Thou

obtain, from a thing: so much used in this tropical sense as to be, in this sense, conventionally
regarded as proper. (MF.) You say, غَرَضُهُ كَذَا
(tropical:)  His object of aim or endeavour or pursuit, &c.,
is such a thing: (Msb:) or his object of want,
and of desire, is such a thing (TA.) And فَعَلَ
لِغَرَضٍ صَحِيحٍ (tropical:)  He did, or acted, for a just, or
right, object of aim &c. (Msb.) And فَهِمْتُ
غَرَضَكَ (assumed tropical:)  I understood, or have understood, thine
object of aim &c., or thine intention; syn. قَصْدَكَ.
