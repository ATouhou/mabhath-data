between the head and the neck: or the عُجْرَة [or
projecting thing] that is upon the place where the
uvula and gullet meet: (K:) or [by an extended application] the head of the حُلْقُوم [or windpipe], (S,
Msb, K,) with its [ducts called] شَوَارِب [q. v. voce
شَارِبٌ] and its حَرْقَدَة [app. meaning pomum
Adami]; (K;) i. e. the projecting place [or part]

many cases, throat]: (S, Msb:) or the root, or
base, of the tongue: (K:) or the place where the
حُلْقُوم [or windpipe, i. e. the head thereof,] becomes in conjunction with the حَلْق [or fauces]

شَرَفٍ وَعَدَدٍ [meaning (assumed tropical:)  He is among (such as are
distinguished by) nobility and number, of his
people], (ISk, K, TA,) [or] meaning, accord. to
As, he is among the chief portion of his people,
and the nobility thereof: (TA:) [and in the same
sense ↓ غَلْصَم is used, without ة, but perhaps only
by poetic license:] Abu-n-Nejm says,
أَبِى لُجَيْمٌ وَاسْمُهُ مِلْءُ الفَمِ
فِى غَلْصَمِ الهَامِ وَهَامِ غَلْصَمِ
[(assumed tropical:)  My father is, or was, Lujeym, and his fame
(a tropical rendering) is what fills the mouth;
one among the chief portion and the nobility of
the headmen, and among headmen of a chief
portion and of nobility]. (TA.)

their necks bound, (app. as captives,) they having
in every bend of a valley or the like some one
slain]. (TA.)
