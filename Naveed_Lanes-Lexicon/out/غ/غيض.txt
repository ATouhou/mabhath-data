غيض1
غَاضَ, aor. يَغِيضُ, inf. n. غَيْضٌ (S, A, Msb,
K) and مَغَاضٌ (Msb, K) and مَغِيضٌ, (TA,) It
(water) became scanty, or little in quantity, and
sank into the earth, or disappeared in the earth:
(S, and so in some copies of the K:) or became
scanty, or little in quantity, and decreased, or
diminished, or became deficient: (A, and so in
some copies of the K:) or sank into the earth,
and went away: (TA:) or went away into the
earth; (Msb;) [contr. of فَاضَ, aor. يَفِيضُ;] as
also ↓ انغاض, (S, K,) which is of the dial. of El-
Hijáz. (TA.) ―
-b2-  It (a thing, Msb, a flow of
milk, TA, and (assumed tropical:)  the price of a commodity, S,
Msb, K) decreased, or diminished, or became
deficient. (S, Msb, K.) ―
-b3-  وَمَا تَغِيضُ الْأَرْحَامُ وَمَا
تَزْدَادُ, (S, * K, * TA,) in the Kur [xiii. 9], (S,)
means And the wombs' falling short [of completion
or of what is usual], (Akh, S, Bd,) and their
exceeding [therein], in respect of the body [of the
fœtus], and the period of gestation, and the
number borne: (Bd:) or, as some say, in respect
of the menstrual blood: (Bd:) or the wombs'
falling short of the nine months (Zj, O, L, and so
in copies of the K, but in others seven months,) of
gestation, and their exceeding the nine [or seven]
months: (Zj, O, L:) or the wombs' falling short
of completion, so that the fœtus dies, and their
exceeding so that the gestation becomes complete:
and accord. to this explanation, the reading of
seven months in the K may be correct: see also
Katádeh's explanation of غَيْضٌ, below, which
favours this reading. (TA.) ―
-b4-  You say also,
غَاضَ الكِرَامُ وَفَاضَ اللِّئَامُ (S, A) (tropical:)  The generous
became few, (S, TA,) and failed, or perished,
(TA,) and the mean became many. (S.)
-A2-
غَاضَهُ, (S, Msb, K,) aor. as above, inf. n. غَيْضٌ,
(TA,) He (God, S, Msb) made it (i. e. water)
to become scanty, or little in quantity, and to
sink into the earth, or disappear in the earth:
(S:) or made it to decrease, or diminish, or become deficient: (K:) or made it to go away into
the earth: (Msb:) and ↓ اغاضهُ signifies the
same; (S, A, K;) and so does ↓ غيّضهُ, inf. n.
تَغْيِيضٌ: (TA:) thus the first of these verbs is
trans. as well as intrans. (S.) [It is said in the
Kur xi. 46,] وَغِيضَ الْمَآءُ (S, A) And the water
was made to become scanty, &c.: (S:) or was
made to decrease, or diminish. (A, * Bd.) And
hence the saying of 'Áïsheh, describing her father,
وَغَاضَ نَبْعَ الرِّدَّةِ (assumed tropical:)  And he did away with what
appeared of apostacy. (TA.) You say also,
دَمْعَهُ ↓ غيّض, (S, * K,) inf. n. as above, (K,) He
made his tears to diminish, (S, K,) and restrained
them: (S:) or he took the tears from his eye and
dashed them away. (Th.) A poet says, (TA,)
namely, Jereer, (O and TA in art. غبض,)
مِنْ عَبَرَاتِهِنَّ وَقُلْنَ لِى ↓ غَيَّضْنَ
مَا ذَا لَقِيتَ مِنَ الهَوَى وَلَقِينَا
meaning They made their tears to flow until they
exhausted them [and they said to me, What is it
that thou hast experienced, of love, and we have
experienced?]: ISd says that من here denotes
some; or it may be redundant, accord. to the
opinion of Abu-l-Hasan; for he holds that it
may be so in affirmative [as well as negative]
phrases, mentioning, as an instance, قَدْ كَانَ مِنْ
مَطَرٍ, meaning قَدْ كَانَ مَطَرٌ. (TA.) One relation of this verse gives غَبَّضْنَ; but the former
is the right. (O and TA in art. غبض.) ―
-b2-  Also
He opened a way, passage, or channel, for it
(namely water) to flow forth to a مَغِيض [q. v.].
(Msb.) ―
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  He diminished it, namely the price
of a commodity; (Ks, S, Msb, K;) as also
↓ اغاضهُ. (K.) ―
-b4-  And He caused him to suffer
loss, or detriment; and wronged, or injured, him.
(ISd, TA.)

غيّضهُ: see 1, latter half, in three places.
-A2-
غيّض said of a lion He frequented, or kept to, the
غَيْضَة [q. v.]. (S, Sgh, L, K.)

إِنْغَيَضَ see 1, first sentence.
غَيْضٌ An abortive fœtus, not completely
formed; (Katádeh, K;) i. e. less than seven months
old. (TA.)
-A2-  (tropical:)  Little; or a small quantity: as in
the saying, or in أَعْطَاهُ غَيْضًا مِنْ فَيْضٍ (tropical:)  He gave
him little from much. (S, A, K.)
-A3-  An abundance of the trees called أَعْلَاث; i. e. طَرْفَآء and
أَثْل and حَاج and عِكْرِش and يَنْبُوت. (TA.) [See
also غَيْضَةٌ.]
غِيضٌ The طَلْع [or spadix of a palm-tree];
(IAar, IDrd, O, K, TA;) like غَضِيضٌ and
إِغْرِيضٌ: (TA:) or the عَجَم (AA, O, K) [thus
correctly (in the CK عُجْم) evidently, I think,
here meaning the heart (commonly called جُمَّار
q. v.) of the palm-tree (the only produce that is
eaten except the dates)] that comes forth, or
coming forth, (K,) or that has not come forth,
(O,) from [amid] its [membranous fibres termed]
لِيف [q. v.], and all of which is eaten. (AA,
O, K.)
غَيْضَةٌ A thicket; syn. أَجَمَةٌ; i. e. a collection
of tangled, or confused, or dense, trees: (Mgh,
Msb:) or an أَجَمَة; i. e. a ↓ مَغِيض [q. v.] of
water collected together, in which, in consequence
thereof, trees grow: (S:) or an أَجَمَة: and a
place in which is a collection of trees in a مَغِيض
of water: (K:) or particularly, of [trees of the
willow-kind called] غَرَب; not of all trees; (AHn,
O, K;) accord. to the first Arabs of the desert;
but this is at variance with what we find in the
poems of the Arabs; for Ru-beh, for instance,
makes it to consist of fruit-bearing trees and trees
not fruit-bearing, and makes it to be a غَابَة:
(AHn, O:) [see also غَيْنَةٌ:] pl. [of pauc.] أَغْيَاضٌ
(S, K) and [of mult.] غِيَاضٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K)
and غَيْضَاتٌ: (Msb:) the first of these being
formed with disregard of the augmentative [ة];
not being a pl. pl., for this is not so formed:
(TA:) any غَرَب in Nejd adjacent to the غَرَب
of the cultivated lands, when they are collected
therein, are termed غِيَاض. (O, TA.) [See also
غَيْضٌ.]
غَائِض as used in the following verse,
إِلَى اللّٰهِ أَشْكُو مِنْ خَلِيلٍ أَوَدُّهُ
ثَلَاثَ خِلَالٍ كُلُّهَا لِىَ غَائِضُ
is said by some to mean غَائِظ, the ض being substituted for ظ; [so that the verse should be
rendered, To God I complain of three qualities,
or habits, of a friend whom I love, every one of
which is to me such as angers;] thus says IJ:
but ISd says that it may be without substitution,
from غَاضَهُ as expl. in the last sentence of the first
paragraph of this art.; and thus the meaning
may be, such as causes me to suffer loss, or
detriment, and such as wrongs, or injures, me.
(TA.)
مَغِيضٌ is an inf. n. (TA. [See 1, first sentence.]) ―
-b2-  And also the pass. part. n. of غَاضَهُ;
applied to water. (Msb, TA. *) ―
-b3-  And a n. of
place, signifying A place where water sinks, or
goes away, into the earth: (Msb, TA:) or مَغِيضُ مَآءٍ
signifies a place where water enters [into the
earth]: and a place where water collects: (Mgh:)
see also غَيْضَةٌ: pl. مَغَايِضُ. (Mgh.)
