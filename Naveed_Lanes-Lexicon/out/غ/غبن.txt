غبن1
غَبَنَهُ, (S, MA, Msb, K,) aor.
غَبِنَ, (Msb, K,)
inf. n. غَبْنٌ (S, MA, Msb, K, KL) and غَبَنٌ, or
the former is [the inf. n. used in this case, i. e.] in
selling [and the like], and the latter is in judgment, or opinion, (K, agreeably with a positive
statement in the S,) He cheated, deceived, overreached, or defrauded, him, (S, MA, K, KL,
TA,) in selling; (S, MA, K, TA;) he endamaged
him, or made him to suffer loss or damage or
detriment, (Msb, KL, TA,) in selling, (KL, TA,)
&c., (KL,) or in the price, or otherwise: (Msb:)
[or] he overcame him in selling and buying.
(Msb.) And غُبِنَ He was cheated, or deceived
[&c. in a purchase]: (S, K, TA:) and ↓ انغبن
[in like manner signifies] he became [cheated or
endamaged or] overcome in selling and buying.
(Msb.) And it is said that غَبَنَ فِى البَيْعِ, inf. n.
غَبْنٌ, signifies He was unmindful, or inadvertent,
[or perhaps غَبَنَ is here a mistranscription for
غُبِنَ, signifying thus, and therefore meaning he
was made to suffer loss,] in selling or in buying.
(TA.) And one says also, غُبِنَ الرَّجُلُ أَشَدَّ الغَبَنَانِ
[The man was cheated or deceived &c. with the
utmost degree of cheating &c.]. (Ibn-Buzurj,
TA.) غَبْنٌ يَسِيرٌ [A petty overreaching or endamaging] is one of which the rate is such as has
been estimated [as allowable by custom] by one estimator, not by every one: and غَبْنٌ فَاحِشٌ [An
exorbitant overreaching or endamaging] is one of
which the rate is such as has not been estimated
[as allowable by custom] by any one. (Dict. of
Technical Terms used in the Sciences of the Musalmans.) [الغُبْنُ وَالغَبَنُ mentioned by Freytag as
occurring in the Fákihet el-Khulafà, and expl. by
him as meaning “ Fraus omnimoda,” should, I
doubt not, be الغَبْنُ وَالغَبَنُ, the two inf. ns. mentioned in the first sentence above.] ―
-b2-  غَبَنَهُ,
aor.
غَبِنَ, inf. n. غَبْنٌ, signifies also He passed by
him (i. e. a man) inclining, or leaning, [or bending
down, so as as to elude his observation, i. e.] so
that he [the latter] did not see him, and was not
cognizant of him. (TA.) ―
-b3-  [And it is said in the
TA that غَيَنُوا النَّاسَ means None but they obtained
it: whence it appears that فِيهِ or the like has
been omitted after النَّاسَ: with this addition, the
phrase may be rendered, they overreached, or
prevented, the other people in respect of it, by obtaining it themselves.] ―
-b4-  هٰذَا يَغْبِنُ عَقْلَكَ, said to
a man whom another had cheated (غَبَنَ) in a
sale, means This [man] attributes defect, or imperfection, to thy intellect. (TA.) ―
-b5-  قَدْ غَبَنُوا
خَبَرَهَا, and غَبِنُوا, aor. of the former verb
غَبُنَ, and of
the latter
غَبَنَ, i. e. لَمْ يَعْلَمُوا عِلْمَهَا [meaning They
have not know her case or state or condition, or
her qualities], (ISh, K, ast; TA,) is a phrase relating
to a she-camel, of which it is said that she is
what one would desire a she-camel to be as a
beast for riding and in generousness of race, but
she is ↓ مَغْبُونَةٌ, [i. e.] one of which the qualities
are not known to be as above mentioned. (ISh,
TA.) ―
-b6-  غَبَنْتَ رَأْيَكَ [if not a mistranscription for
غَبِنْتَ (see غَبِنَ رَأْيَهُ in what follows)] means

the thing: or he was unmindful, neglectful, or
heedless, of it; (K, TA;) and ignorant of it:
(TA:) or he made a mistake in respect of it; (K,
TA;) as in the saying, غَبِنَ كَذَا مِنْ حَقِّهِ عِنْدَ
فُلَانٍ [he made a mistake in respect of such a thing,
of his right, or due, to be required at the hand of such
a one]. (TA.) ―
-b8-  غَبِنَ رَأْيَهُ, inf. n. غَبَنٌ (S, Msb, K)
and غَبَانَةٌ, (S, * K,) means He was, or became,
deficient in his judgment, or opinion: (S:) or he
was, or became, weak [therein]: (K:) or his intelligence, or sagacity, and his sharpness, or acuteness, of mind, went away: (Msb:) the parsing
of this phrase has been [fully] expl. voce سَفِهَ
[q. v.]. (S.)
-A2-  غَبَنَ الثَّوْبَ, (S, Mgh, Msb, TA,)
inf. n. غَبْنٌ, (K,) from مَغْبِنٌ [q. v.], (Msb,) He
folded, or doubled, the garment, (T, Mgh, Msb,
K, * TA,) it being [too] long. (T, TA,) and then
sewed it; (Mgh, Msb;) like خَبَنَهُ [q. v.] (S,
Mgh) and كَبَنَهُ. (Mgh.) And غَبَنَ الدَّلْوَ He
folded, or doubled, [the edge of] the leathern
bucket, to shorten it. (TA: but only the inf. n.
of the verb thus used is there mentioned.) ―

And غَبَنَ الشَّئْ He hid, or concealed, the thing
in the مَغْبِن [or armpit or groin or the like];
(TA;) as also ↓ اغتبنهُ. (K, TA.) غَبَنَ الطَّعَامَ

تَغَابُنٌ signifies Mutual غَبْن [i. e. cheating
or endamaging or overcoming in selling and buying: and ↓ مُغَابَنَةٌ signifies the same; or mutual
endeavoring to cheat &c: see 3 in art زبن]. (S,
MA, K, KL, TA.) Hence, يَوْمُ التَّغَابُنِ [in the
Kur lxiv. 9], an appellation of The day of resurrection; because the people of Paradise will then
overreach (تَغْبِنُ) the people of Hell, (S, K, TA,)
by the state of enjoyment in which the former
will become and the punishment which the latter
will experience; or, as El-Hasan says, because
the former will attribute defect, or imperfection,
to the intellects of the latter by reason of the preferring infidelity to faith. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And تغابن
له [i. e. لَهُ, but this, I think, is probably a mistranscription for بِهِ,] signifies تَقَاعَدَ [i. e. تقاعد
بِهِ, meaning He did not pay him his due,] حَتَّى
غُبِنَ [so that he was cheated or endamaged or
overcome]. (TA.)
