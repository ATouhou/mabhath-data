غَبِ3َ,
inf. n. غَبٌّ (S, Msb, K) and غُبُوبٌ, (Msb, K,)
The camels, (S,) or cattle, (Msb, K,) came to
water, (S,) or drank, (Msb, K,) on alternate
days; one day and not the next day. (S, Msb,
K.) ―
-b2-  Hence, (IAth, TA,) غَبَّ said of a man
means He came visiting at intervals of some days,
or after some days. (AA, IAth, TA.) [See also
غِبٌّ: and see غُبَيْسٌ.] ―
-b3-  And غَبَّ عَنِ القَوْمِ,
(Ks, S, Msb, K,) aor.
غَبُ3َ, the verb in this case
being of the class of قَتَلَ, [but this is contr. to
analogy, as well as to the derivation,] inf. n. غِبٌّ,
with kesr, He came to the people, or party, day
after day: (Msb:) or, as also القَوْمَ ↓ اغبّ, he
came to the people, or party, on alternate days,
coming one day and not the next: (Ks, S, K:) or
he came to them once in two days or more. (TA.)
It is said in a trad., فِى عِيَادَةِ المَرِيضِ ↓ أَغِبُّوا
وَأَرْبِعُوا Visit ye the sick on alternate days and
after intervals of two days: (S, TA:) not every
day, lest he find your visits to be troublesome.

↓ أَغْبَبْتُهُ, inf. n. إِغْبَابٌ, meaning I visited him
[once] in every week. (A.) ―

↓ أَغَبَّت signify the same: (S:) you say, غَبَّتْ
عَلَيْهِ الحُمَّى, The fever came upon him, (Msb,)
or attacked him, (K,) one day and intermitted

عَلَيْهِ. (K.) [See also غِبٌّ.] ―
-b5-  You say also,
غَبَّ عِنْدَنَا, (S, L, K,) and ↓ اغبّ, (L, K,) He
passed the night, or a night, at our abode. (S, L,
K.) Hence the saying, رُوَيْدَ الشِّعْرَ يَغِبَّ [so accord. to the TA, حَتَّى being understood, accord.
to the explanation of Meyd, but in the CK, and
in one of my copies of the S, and in Freytag's
Arab. Prov. i. 522, يَغِبُّ,] (S, K,) i. e. Leave
thou the poetry until some days shall have passed,
that thou mayest see what will be its result,
whether it will be praised or dispraised: (Meyd,
TA:) or it may be from غَبَّت said of a fever, and
may thus mean, leave thou the poetry to be kept
back from people, [or to be intermitted,] i. e. do
not repeat it to people in an uninterrupted manner,
lest they become weary. (Meyd. [See also art.

food, it became altered [for the worse] in its
odour: (L:) or, said of flesh-meat, it became
stinking: (T, S, K;) as also ↓ اغبّ: (T, K:)
and it (a thing) became corrupt. (TA. [See also
2.]) ―

[Hence,] كَتَبَ إِلَيْهِ يُغَبِّبُ مِنْ هُلْكِ المُسْلِمِينَ,
(TA,) or عَنْ هَلَاكِ المسلمين, (thus in the O,)
(tropical:)  He wrote to him not acquainting him with the
