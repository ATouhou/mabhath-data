غزو1
غَزَاهُ, [aor.
غَزُوَ,] inf. n. غَزْوٌ, He willed, or
desired, it; he sought it; and he aimed at it,
intended it, or meant it; syn. أَرَادَهُ; and طَلَبَهُ;
and قَصَدَهُ; [the first of which is often used in
the same senses as the second and third;] as also
↓ اغتزاهُ; (K, TA;) this last mentioned by ISd
as syn. with قَصَدَهُ. (TA.) One says, عَرَفْتُ مَا
يُغْزَى مِنْ هٰذَا الكَلَامِ i. e. [I knew, or,
emphatically, I know,] what is willed or desired
(مَا يُرَادُ) [from this speech]. (S.) And غَزْوِى
كَذَا My aim, or intention, or meaning, is such a
thing. (K.) ―
-b2-  [Hence, app.,] غَزَا العَدُوَّ, inf. n.
غَزْوٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and غَزَوَانٌ, (K, TA,) or,
as some say, غَزْوَانٌ, mentioned by Sb, (TA,) and
غَزَاوَةٌ, (K,) [but see what is said of this last at
the close of this paragraph,] He went forth, (Er-Rághib, TA,) or repaired, or betook himself,
(Mgh,) to wage war, (Er-Rághib, TA,) or to
fight, (Mgh,) with the enemy; (Er-Rághib, Mgh,
TA;) or he went to fight with, and plunder, the
enemy; (K, TA;) in the country of the latter.
(Msb.) [And غَزَا alone, the objective complement being understood, often signifies the same;
or He engaged in a warring, or warring and
plundering, expedition, or in such expeditions.] ―
-b3-
And غَزَا إِلَيْهِ, inf. n. as above, He tended, repaired,
betook himself, or went, to, or towards, him, or it;
syn. قَصَدَهُ. (TA.)
-A2-  غَزَاوَةٌ, mentioned above, is
of a measure which in most instances is that of an
inf. n. of an intrans. verb, and it seems to be an
inf. n. of which the verb is غَزُوَ, meaning جَادَ غَزْوُهُ
[i. e. Excellent, or how excellent, is his engaging
in a warring, or warring and plundering, expedition, or in such expeditions!]; and to be similar
to قَضُوَ meaning جَادَ قَضَآءُهُ, and ضَرُبَتْ يَدُهُ meaning جَادَ ضَرْبُهَا. (TA.)

اغزاهُ He fitted him out, equipped him, or
furnished him, (S,) or he sent him, (Mgh, Msb,)
or he urged, or incited, him, (K,) to engage in a
warring, or warring and plundering, expedition,
(S, * Mgh, * Msb, * K,) in the country of the enemy;
(Msb;) and ↓ غزّاهُ signifies the same. (K.)
-A2-
أَغْزَتْ, said of a woman, (Mgh, K,) Her husband
was absent [engaged in a warring, or warring
and plundering, expedition, in the country of the
enemy]; (Mgh;) or her husband went [or had
gone] to fight with, and plunder, the enemy. (K.)
―
-b2-  And, said of a she-camel, Her impregnation
was, or became, difficult. (S, K.)
-A3-  And اغزاهُ
He granted him some delay, and deferred [the
exacting of] the debt that he owed. (S, K.)

-A2-  اغتزى بِفُلَانٍ

(TA.) A poet says,
قَدْ يَغْتَزِى الهِجْرَانُ بِالتَّجَرُّمِ
[Sometimes, or often, the cutting off from friendly
intercourse has the accusation of that which is a
crime, or a fault, or an offence, peculiarly assigned
to it (as the cause)]: التجرّم here meaning اِدِّعَآءُ
الجُرْمِ. (TA.)

غُزِىٌّ, (K,) [originally غُزُوىٌ,] of the measure
فُعُولٌ, (TA,) and ↓ غَزِىٌّ is pl. of [the pl.] غُزَاةٌ,
(S, Msb,) or [rather] a quasi-pl. n.; (K;) and
↓ غَازِيَةٌ signifies a company, or body, of غُزَاة.

which are discommended, the young camel thereof
being always weak. (TA.)
مَغْزًى The intended sense of a saying; the

in warring, or warring and plundering, expeditions, pl. of غَازٍ]: (K, TA:) in which sense, some
say, it has no sing., but others say that its sing.
is مَغْزَاةٌ or ↓ مَغْزًى. (TA.)
مَغْزِىٌّ [as pass. part. n. of غَزَا] was used as an
epithet applied to a man: it is properly with و
[i. e. مَغْزُوٌّ]; but there are many instances of the
former kind. (TA.)
