inf. n. غَشٌّ, (Msb, TA,) or غِشٌّ, with kesr, (S,)

he dressed up to him an affair [in false colours]:
(Msb:) or he acted towards him with dissimulation: pretended to him the contrary of what he
conceived in his mind: (A, K:) but this is a
needless addition, for it is the same as the first
explanation (TA:) as also ↓ غشّشهُ, (K,) inf. n.
تَغْشِيشٌ: (TA) or this latter has an intensive
signification: it is said to be derived from غَشَشٌ,
signifying “ a turbid drinking-place,” (TA:) It
is said in the story of Umm-Zara, accord. to one
relation, ↓ لَا تَمْلَأُ بَيْتَنَا تَغْشِيشًا, said by some to be
from الغِشُّ, and by others to be from [a usage of]
التغشيش as signifying النَّمِيمَةُ [app. here meaning
the embellishing speech with falsehood]: but accord.
to the approved relation, it is [تَغْشِيشًا] with the
unpointed letter. (IAth.) [See art. عش.] ―

استغشّهُ (S, K) and ↓ اغتشّهُ (K, TA) He
reckoned him, or deemed him, dishonest, or insincere, in action, or advice or counsel; contr. of

means the same,] i. q. عَدَّهُ غَاشًّا: (TA:) or he
imagined in him dishonest, or insincere, conduct,
or advice or counsel; dissimulation; or the pretending the contrary of what he conceived in his
mind. (K.) A poet says,

وَمُسْتَنْصَحٍ بِالْغَيْبِ غَيْرُ أَمِينِ

be originally of the measure فَعِلٌ, (TA,) applied
to a man, (K, TA,) i. q. عَظِيمُ الشَّرَهِ [i. e. Very
greedy]; not عظيم السُّرَّةِ, as in some copies of
the K; nor عظيم الشِّرَّةِ, as in other copies: a
rájiz says,
لَيْسَ بِغَشٍّ هَمُّهُ فِيمَا أَكَلْ
[He is not one who is very greedy; whose care, or
solicitude, is in respect of what he has eaten].
(TA)
غِشٌّ Dishonest, or insincere, conduct, or advice
or counsel: (Msb, K:) and the embellishment of

غَشَشٌ A turbid drinking-place: (Az, IAmb,
Sgh, TA:) الكَدِرُ المَشُوبُ in the K is a mistake:
the right explanation of الغَشَشُ being المَشْرَبُ
الكَدِرُ, which is that given by Az and IAmb and
Sgh. (TA.)
غَشَاشٌ: see the next paragraph.
غِشَاشٌ, applied to a drinking (شُرْبٌ), Little in
quantity, (K, TA,) because of turbidness: (TA:
[in which it is said to be applied in like manner
to a day, يوم; but I think that this is a mistranscription for نَوْمٌ, i. e. sleep:]) or hasty. or
not wholesome; (K, TA;) because the water is
not clear. (TA.)

darkness: and the end thereof. (K.)

found, him, or it, in haste; (T, S, K:) and so
على غشاش: (T, TA:) or at sunset; (Lth, K;)
but Az disallows this: (TA:) or in the night;
(K;) which is nearly the same as what Lth says.
