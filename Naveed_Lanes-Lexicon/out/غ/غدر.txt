غدر1
غَدَرَهُ, (K,) and [more commonly] غَدَرَ بِهِ,
aor.
غَدِرَ (S, M, IKtt, Msb, K) and
غَدُرَ; (M, IKtt,
K;) and غَدِرَ, aor.
غَدَرَ, (Lh, K,) but ISd doubts the
correctness of this last; (TA;) inf. n. غَدْرٌ, (S,
Msb, K,) of غَدَرَ; (S, Msb, TA;) and غَدَرٌ (TA,
and so in the CK in the place of غَدْر,) and
غَدَرَانٌ, (K, TA,) which are both of غَدِرَ; (TA;)
He acted perfidiously, unfaithfully, faithlessly, or
treacherously, to him; (M, K;) he broke his compact, contract, covenant, or the like, with him;
(Msb;) he neglected the performance, or fulfilment, of his compact, &c., with him: (S:) غَدْرٌ
is the contr. of وَفَآءٌ, (K,) or of وَفَآءٌ بِعَهْدٍ: (M:)
or it signifies the being remiss in a thing, and
neglecting it. (B.)
-A2-  غَدَرَ, aor.
غَدِرَ, (T, O, K,)
inf. n. غَدْرٌ, (T, O,) He drank the water of the
غَدِير [q. v.]: (T, O, K:) and, accord. to the K,
غَدِرَ, he drank the water of the sky; but this is a
sheer mistake, occasioned by a misunderstanding
of a saying in the T; here following: (TA:) Az
says that غَدَرَ meaning as expl. above should
accord. to analogy be غَدِرَ, like كَرِعَ meaning
“ he drank the كَرَع,” i. e. the water of the sky:
(O, TA:) moreover, a distinction is strangely
made in the K between the water of the غَدِير
and the water of the sky. (TA.)
-A3-  غَدَرَتْ وَلَدَهَا,
said of a woman, is like دَغَرَتْهُ [q. v.]. (TA.)
-A4-
غَدِرَ, [aor.
غَدَرَ, inf. n. غَدَرٌ,] He remained, or lagged,
behind; as also ↓ تغدّر, accord. to As, who cites
the following verse of Imra-el-Keys:
عَشِيَّةَ جَاوَزْنَا حَمَاةَ وَسَيْرُنَا
أَخُو الجَهْدِ لَا نَلْوِى عَلَى مِنْ تَغْدَّرَا
[In the evening when we passed beyond Hamáh,
and our journeying was laborious, we not waiting
for such as lagged behind]: but accord. to one
relation it is تَعَذَّرَ, which means [the same, or]
“ held back, or withheld himself, for a cause rendering him excused. ” (TA.) You say غَدِرَ عَنْ
أَصْحَابِهِ He remained, or lagged, behind his companions. (TA.) And غَدِرَتِ النَّاقَةُ عَنِ الإِبِلِ, (S,
K,) and الشَّاةُ عَنِ الغَنَمِ, (S,) The she-camel remained, or lagged, behind the other camels, (S,
K,) not coming up to them, (TA,) and so the
sheep, or goat, behind the other sheep, or goats.
(S.) And غَدَرَ فُلَانٌ بَعْدَ إِخْوَتِهِ Such a one remained after the death of his brothers. (TA.
[But غَدَرَ, here, is app. a mistake for غَدِرَ, unless
both forms be allowable.])

in the place of pasture in the first of the growth
thereof. (K.)

3
غادرهُ, inf. n. مُغَادَرَةٌ (S, K) and غِدَارٌ; (K;)
and ↓ اغدرهُ; (S, K;) He left him, or it; (S, K;)
he left him, or it, remaining. (K.) It is said in
the Kur xviii. 47, لَا يُغَادِرُ صَغِيرَةً وَلَا كَبِيرَةً It
will not leave, or omit, or it will not fall short of,
(TA,) a small sin nor a great sin. (Jel.) And in
a trad., يَا لَيْتَنِى غُودِرْتُ مَعَ أَصْحَابِ نُحْصِ الجَبَلِ
Would that I had [been left behind, and had] suffered martyrdom with the people of the foot of the
mountain of Ohud, who were slain there, and the
other martyrs: said by Mohammad. (A 'Obeyd.)
[See also a verse of 'Antarah cited voce مُتَرَدَّمٌ;
and another, of Kutheiyir, voce عَسْبٌ.] ―

or goat, behind the other sheep, or goats. (S.)
And لَهُ ذٰلِكَ فِى قَلْبِى مَوَدَّةً

meaning hard, and that does not show a footmark, or rugged and hard], abounding with
stones: (S, O, TA:) or a place abounding with
stones, difficult to traverse: (TA:) or any difficult
place, through which the beast can hardly, or in
nowise, pass: (K:) or soft ground, in which are
[trenches, or channels, such as are termed] لَخَاقِيق:
(TA:) or burrows, (Lh, S, K, TA,) and banks,
or ridges, worn and undermined by water, (Lh,
TA,) and uneven لَخَاقِيق in the ground: (Lh, S,
K, TA: [and the like is also said in the TA on
the authority of As:]) and stones (K, TA) with
trees; thus accord. to AZ and IKtt: (TA:) and
anything that conceals one, and obstructs his sight:
pl. أَغْدَارٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] one says, مَا أَثْبَتَ
غَدَرَهُ, meaning مَا أَثْبَتَهُ فِى الغَدَرِ [How firm is
he in traversing the rugged and hard and stony
place! &c.]: this is said of the horse: and also
(assumed tropical:)  of the man when his tongue is firm in the place
of slipping and of contention or litigation: (S,
TA:) or, accord. to Lh, it means (assumed tropical:)  how firm,
or valid, is his argument, or plea, and how seldom
does harm in consequence of slipping and stumbling befall him! or, accord. to Ks, how firm is
what remains of his intellect or understanding!

intensely-dark night, (S,) in which the darkness
confines men in their places of alighting or abode,

غدر [i. e. غَدَر]. (L, TA.)

TA,) and ↓ غَدَرَةٌ and ↓ غَدَرٌ, (Lh, TA,) and ↓ غُدَارَةٌ,

أَرْضٌ غَدْرَآءُ Land abounding with places of the
kind termed غَدَر. (IKtt, TA.)
غَدَارِ: see غَادِرٌ.
غَدُورٌ: see غَادِرٌ, in two places.
-A2-  Also A she-camel that remains, or lags, behind the other
camels: (K, TA:) in some of the copies of the
K غَدُورَةٌ, with ة; but the former is the right.
(TA.) And غَبِرَةٌ غَمْرَةٌ ↓ نَاقَةٌ غَدِرَةٌ A she-camel
that remains, or lags, behind the other camels, in
being driven. (Lh.)
غَدِيرٌ A pool of water left by a torrent:
(A 'Obeyd, S, M, K:) of the measure فَعِيلٌ in the
sense of the measure مُفَاعِلٌ, from غَادَرهُ, or مُفْعَلٌ,
from أَغْدَرَهُ; or, as some say, of the measure فَعِيلٌ
in the sense of the measure فَاعِلٌ; (S;) because
it is unfaithful to those who come to it to water,
failing when much wanted: (S, * TA:) but it is
a subst.; [not an epithet; or an epithet in which
the quality of a subst. predominates, and only
used as a subst.:] you do not say هٰذَا مَآءٌ غَدِيرٌ:
(Lh:) or a place in which rain-water stagnates,
whether small or large, not remaining until the
summer: (Lth:) or a river: (Msb:) [but this
is extr.:] pl. [of pauc. أَغْدِرَةٌ, (occurring in a verse
cited voce إِلَّا, &c.,) and of mult.] غُدْرَانٌ (S, Msb,
K, TA) and غُدُرٌ (S, Nh, L, TA,) which last is
sometimes contracted into غُدْرٌ: (TA:) in the K,
the last pl. is said to be of the measure of
صُرَدٌ; [i. e. ↓ غُدَرٌ;] but this is inconsistent with
what is said in other lexicons, as shown above:
and it is also said in the K that غُدَرٌ signifies the
same as غَدِيرٌ, in the sense first given above; but
it appears that this is a pl. of غُدْرَةٌ; and that, in
the K, we should read, for وَالغَدِيرُ, كَالغَدِيرِ, and
place this before, instead of after, its explanation.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  Hence, (tropical:)  A piece of herbage; (TA;)
as also ↓ غَدِيرَةٌ: pl. غُدْرَانٌ: (K, TA;) this is the
only pl. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Hence also, (TA,) (tropical:)  A sword;
(K, TA;) like as it is called لُجٌّ. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And
↓ غَدِيرَةٌ also signifies A she-camel left by the
pastor (S, K) behind the other camels; and in like
manner, a sheep, or goat. (S.)

-A2-  Also
A portion, or lock, or plaited lock, of hair, hanging from the head; syn. ذُؤَابَةٌ: (S, K:) accord.
to Lth, every عَقِيصَة is a غَدِيرَة; and the غَدِيرَتَانِ
are the two portions, or locks, or plaited locks, of
hair (ذَؤَابَتَانِ) which fall upon the breast: (TA:)
pl. غَدَائِرُ: (S, K:) or غدائر pertain to women,
and are plaited; and ضَفَائِر, to men. (TA.)
-A3-
غَدِيرَةُ الحَائِكِ means The hollow, in the ground,
in which the weaver puts his legs, or feet: also

غَدَّارٌ: see غَادِرٌ; the first and third, in two
places.
غَدِّيرٌ: see غَادِرٌ; the first and third, in two
places.
غَدَّارَةٌ: see غَادِرٌ; the first and third, in two
places.
غَادِرٌ and ↓ غُدَرٌ [respecting which see below]
(S, K) and ↓ غَدُورٌ and ↓ غَدَّارٌ and ↓ غِدِّيرٌ (K)
are epithets applied to a man [and signifying, the
first, Perfidious, unfaithful, faithless, or treacherous; or acting perfidiously, &c.; and the rest,
very perfidious, &c.]: (S, K:) and ↓ غَدُورٌ and
↓ غَدَّارٌ and ↓ غَدَّارَةٌ are epithets applied to a
woman [and signifying as above]: (K:) but
↓ غُدَر is mostly used in calling to a man and
reviling him: (S:) you say to a man, يَا غُذَرُ [O
very perfidious man]; (S, K;) and in like manner,
↓ يَا مَغْدَرُ, and ↓ يا مَغْدِرُ, and ↓ يَا ابْنَ مَغْدَرٍ, and
↓ يا ابن مَغْدِرٍ, all determinate; (K, TA;) and to
a woman, ↓ يا غَدَارِ, like قَطَامِ: (K:) [accord. to
some, ↓ غُدَر is only used in this manner, and is
therefore without tenween; for] it is said that
رَجُلٌ غُدَرُ is not allowable, because غُدَرُ is determinate: but Sh says رَجُلٌ غُدَرٌ, writing it, says
Az, with tenween, contr. to what Lth says; and
this is correct; a word of the measure فُعَل being
imperfectly decl. [only] when it is a determinate
subst., like عُمَرُ and زُفَرُ: and IAth says that غُدَرُ
is altered from its original form, which is غَادِرٌ, for
the sake of intensiveness: (TA:) in the pl. [sense]
you say يَالَ غُدَرَ, (S,) or يَا لَغُدَرَ, [for يَا آلَ غُدَرَ,
(see the letter ل, and see آلٌ, in art. اول,)] like
يَا لَفُجَرَ. (TA.) It is said in a trad., ↓ يَا غُدَرُ
↓ أَلَسْتُ أَسْعَى فِى غَدْرَتِكَ [app. meaning, O thou
very perfidious: am I not striving, or labouring,
in respect of thine act of perfidy, to rectify it?].
(S: but in one copy, غُدْرَتِكَ.) And in another
trad., relating to El-Hodeybiyeh, وَهَلْ ↓ يَا غُدَرُ
إِلَّا بِالْأَمْسِ ↓ غَسَلْتَ غَدْرَتَكَ [O thou very perfidious: and didst thou wash away thine act of perfidy
save yesterday?]: said by 'Orweh Ibn-Mes'ood
to El-Mugheereh. (TA.) And in another trad.,
↓ اِجْلِسْ غُدَرُ [Sit thou, O very perfidious]; for
يَا غُدَرُ: said by 'Áïsheh to El-Kásim. (TA.) ―
-b2-
[Hence,] ↓ سِنُونَ غَدَّارَةٌ (tropical:)  Years in which is much
rain and little herbage; from [the inf. n.] الغَدْرُ;
i. e. that excite people's eager desire for abundance
of herbage, by the rain, and then fail to fulfil
their promise. (TA.) ―
-b3-  [And ↓ غَدِرٌ is app.
syn. with غَادِرٌ; for] غَدِرَةٌ occurs in a trad. applied
to land (أَرْض), as though meaning (assumed tropical:)  Not producing herbage bountifully; or giving growth to
herbage, and then soon becoming blighted, or
blasted; wherefore it is likened to the غَادِر, who
acts unfaithfully. (TA.)
-A2-  See also غُدْرَةٌ, last
sentence.
