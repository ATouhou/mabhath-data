غلف1
غَلَفَ, (S, O, Msb, K,) aor.
غَلِفَ, (Msb,) inf. n.
غَلْفٌ, (O, Msb, TA,) He put a bottle, or flask,
(S, O, K, TA,) or a knife, (Msb,) &c., (TA,)
into a غِلَاف [q. v.]; (S, O, Msb, K, TA;) as
also ↓ اغلف, (S, Msb,) inf. n. إِغْلَافٌ; (Msb;) or
↓ غلّف, inf. n. تَغْلِيفٌ: (K, TA:) or ↓ the second
signifies, (Msb,) or signifies also, (S,) he furnished
it with a غِلَاف; (S, Msb;) or ↓ غلّف signifies
thus: (TA:) القَارُورَةَ ↓ أَغْلَفْتُ is said by Lth to
be from الغِلَافُ; and so ↓ غَلَّفْتُهَا, inf. n. تَغْلِيفٌ.
(O.) ―
-b2-  And accord. to Lth, (O,) one says, غَلَفَ
لِحْيَتَهُ بِالغَالِيَةِ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb,) aor.
غَلِفَ, (Msb,)
inf. n. غَلْفٌ, (S,) meaning He daubed, or smeared,
his beard with [the perfume called] غَالِيَة [q. v.],
(Mgh, TA,) and likewise with other perfume,
and with حِنَّآء; (TA;) and ↓ غَلَّفَهَا: (Mgh, TA:)
but accord. to IDrd, the vulgar say so: (O, Msb,
TA:) he says that the correct phrase is غَلَّاهَا
(Mgh, O, Msb, TA) بالغالية, (O,) and غَلَّلَهَا:
(Mgh, O, Msb:) in a trad. of 'Aacute;ïsheh, however,
لِحْيَةَ رَسُولِ اللّٰهِ ↓ كُنْتُ أُغَلِّفُ occurs as meaning I
used to daub, or smear, the beard of the Apostle of
God with غالية, doing so abundantly: (TA:) and
one says, of a man, ↓ تغلّف (Lth, Th, S, O, TA)
بِالغَالِيَةِ (Th, S, TA) وَسَائِرِ الطِّيبِ (Th, TA) [i. e.
He daubed, or smeared, himself, or his beard,
with غالية and the other sorts of perfume]; and
[in like manner,] ↓ اغتلف (Lth, O, TA) مِنَ
الغَالِيَةِ (Lth, O) or مِنَ الطِّيبِ: (TA:) but accord.
to the saying of IDrd [mentioned above], these
are wrong, and should be only تَغَلَّى and تَغَلَّلَ,
and اِغْتَلَى and اِغْتَلَّ: (O:) or, accord. to Ibn-El-Faraj, one says بالغالية ↓ تغلّف when it is

roots of the hair. (O, TA. [See also 2 in art.
