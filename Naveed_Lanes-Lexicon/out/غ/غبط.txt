غبط1
غَبَطَهُ aor.
غَبِطَ, (S, K,) inf. n. غَبْطٌ, (S,) He
felt with his hand his (a ram's) أَلْيَة [i. e. rump,
or tail, or fat of the tail,] in order to see if he
were fat or not: (S, K:) and he felt it (his back)
with his hand in order to know whether he were
lean or fat: (Lth, K: *) and in like manner the
verb is used in relation to a she-camel. (TA.)
-A2-  غَبَطَهُ, aor.
غَبِطَ; (ISk, Az, S, Msb, K;) and
غَبِطَهُ, aor.
غَبَطَ; (Ibn-Buzurj, Sgh, K;) inf. n. غَبْطٌ
(ISk, Az, S, Msb, K) and غِبْطَةٌ, (S, K,) or the
latter is a simple subst.; (Msb;) He regarded
him [with unenvious emulation, i. e.] with a wish
for the like of his condition, (ISk, Az, S,) meaning a good condition, (Az,) or for the like of that
which he had attained, (Msb,) or for a blessing,
(K,) and that it might not pass away, (ISk, K,)
or without desiring that it should pass away, (Az,
S, Msb,) from the latter person: (ISk, Az, S,
Msb, K:) the doing so is not حَسَدٌ, (Az, S, Msb,)
for this implies the desire that what is wished for
may pass away from its possessor; (Az, Msb;)
or it is a kind of حَسَد, of a more moderate
quality: (Az:) or غِبْطَةٌ and غَبْطٌ have the signification shown above, and are also syn. with
حَسَدٌ; (K;) this latter meaning is assigned to
غَبْطٌ by IAar; and it is said that the Arabs use
غَبْطٌ in the sense of حَسَدٌ metonymically; (TA;)
[so that غَبَطَهُ and غَبِطَهُ may also mean (tropical:)  he envied him; &c.; see an ex. in a prov. cited voce
بَطْنٌ; but it is said that] حَسَدٌ, when it is for
courage and the like, is syn. with غِبْطَةٌ, and then
it implies admiration, without a wish that the
thing admired may pass away from its possessor.
(Msb in art. حسد.) You say, غَبَطَهُ بِهِ, (S,) and
عَلَيْهِ, (IAth,) and فِيهِ, (Msb,) He regarded him
with a wish for the like of it, meaning a thing or
state which he had attained, without desiring that
it should pass away from the latter person. (S,
IAth, * Msb.) Mohammad was asked, “Does
الغَبْط injure? ” and he answered, “Yes, like as
الخَبْط injures: ” or, accord. to the relation of
A'Obeyd, “No, save as الخَبْط injures the [trees
called] عِضَاه: ” (Az, TA:) [see خَبَطَ:] by الغيط
meaning, accord. to some, الحَسَد: (TA:) or a
kind thereof, of a more moderate quality; injurious, but not so injurious as الحسد whereby
one wishes that a blessing may pass away from
his brother; الخبط meaning the beating off the
leaves of trees; after which they become replaced,
without there resulting any injury therefrom to
the stock and branches: moreover, الغبط sometimes occasions the smiting of its object with the
evil eye. (Az, TA.) [See also غِبْطَةٌ, below.]
-A3-
Accord. to IKtt, غَبَطَ signifies also He lied;
but perhaps it is a mistranscription for عَبَطَ, which
has this meaning; for it is not mentioned by any
other. (TA.)
2
غَبَّطَ It is said in a trad., جَآءَ وَهُمْ يُصَلُّونَ فَيَجْعَلَ
يُغَبِّطُهُمْ; thus it is related, meaning, [He came
to them while they were praying, and he began] to
incite them to wish for the like of that action: if
related without teshdeed, [يَغْبِطُهُمْ,] the meaning
is, to regard them with a wish for the like condition, because of their forwardness to prayer.
(Nh, K.)

(S, K) upon the back of the camel, (S,) or upon
the beast, (K,) not putting it down from him.

فِى السَّيْرِ They kept the saddles on their travellingcamels night and day, not putting them down, in
