لَا آتِيكَ مَا غَبَا غُبَيْسٌ means I will not come to
thee ever: (S, K:) but the origin of this saying
is unknown: (K:) IAar said that he knew it
not: (S:) or, accord. to him, it means, while

first, and then thus explained it: (T, TA:)
accord. to some, غُبَيْسٌ is an abbreviated dim. of
أَغْبَسُ, and means the wolf; (S, K; *) and غَبَا is
originally غَبَّ, the ا being substituted for one of
the letters of duplication, as in تَقَضَّى for تَقَضَّضَ;
(S;) and the saying means I will not come to thee
as long as the wolf comes now and then (يَأْتِى غِبًّا)
to the sheep or goats. (S, K. *)
