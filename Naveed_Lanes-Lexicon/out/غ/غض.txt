غض1
غَضَّ طَرْفَهُ, (S, A, Msb, K,) aor. يَغُضُّ, (Msb, *
TA,) [and يَغْضُضْ may be used, in the dial. of
El-Hijáz, instead of its contracted form يَغُضَّ,]
imp. غُضَّ, (S, A,) in the dial. of Nejd, (S,) and
اُغْضُضْ, in the dial. of El-Hijáz, (S,) inf. n. غَضٌّ
(Msb, K) and غِضَاضٌ, with kesr, (A, K,) and
غَضَاضٌ and غَضَاضَةٌ, with fet-h, (K,) He lowered
his eye, or eyes; (S, A, Msb, K;) as also غَضَّ
مِنْ طَرْفِهِ; (Msb;) [the من being redundant,
accord. to some; but see what is said on this
point below:] and he contracted his eye, or eyes;
syn. كَسَرَهُ; [so as to wrinkle the lids;] or he
blinked; i. e. he contracted his eyelids, or drew
them near together, and looked: [this signification is very common:] and he contracted (كَسَرَ)
his eye, or eyes, and looked towards the ground,
not opening his eye [or eyes]: and sometimes it
indicates a state of abasement. (TA.) Also غَضَّ
alone, inf. n. غَضَاضَةٌ, He contracted his eyelids;
like أَغْضَى: he looked languishingly. (TA.) It
is said in the Kur [xxiv. 30], قُلْ لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ يَغُضُّوا
مِنْ أَبْصَارِهِمْ, in which some of the grammarians
hold من to be redundant; but the meaning is
obvious, i. e. [Say thou to the believers] that they
shall abridge their look, or view, from what is
prohibited to them: (Sgh:) or that they shall
restrain somewhat of their look, or view. (TA.)

or imputed to him, charged him with, or accused
him of, a vice, fault, or the like: (Msb:) and,
inf. n. غَضَاضَةٌ, he disdained it, or scorned it; as

thee, or defrauded thee, of anything. (TA.) And
لَا أَغُضُّكَ دِرْهَمًا I will not abridge thee, deprive thee,
or defraud thee, of a dirhem. (TA.) You also
say, غَضَّ مِنَ الشَّعَرِ He shortened the hair. (M in
art. قصر.) And [in like manner] one says, غَضَّ
مِنْ رَأْسِهِ, i. q. طَمَّ رَأْسَهُ. (K voce طَمَّ, q. v.) ―
-b7-
Also He broke it (i. e. a branch, or stick, or the
like,) but did not break it thoroughly; (L, K,
TA;) and so ↓ غضّضهُ. (L, TA.) ―

accord. to the T, some say غَضِضْتَ, aor. تَغَضُّ,
and some say غَضَضْتَ, aor. تَغَضُّ: (IB, TA;)
but the latter of these requires consideration;
(TA;) inf. n. غُضُوضَةٌ (IAar, S, K) and غَضَاضَةٌ;
(S, K;) or the former only, accord to Alee Ibn-
Hamzeh; but the saying بَضَاضَةٌ and بُضُوضَةٌ, to
denote the quality of that which is termed بَضٌّ,
strengthens what J says [in the S] with respect
to غَضَاضَةٌ; (IB;) It (a thing) was, or became,
fresh, juicy, sappy, moist, not flaccid. (S, Msb:)
or flourishing and fresh; or luxuriant: (IAar:)
