fragrant with aromatic perfumes, used in combing and dressing one's hair: one should not say
غَسْلَةٌ. (S, O.) IAar cites the following verse
(S, O) of 'Abd-Er-Rahmán Ibn-Dárah El-Ghatafánee, (O,)
فَيَا لَيْلَ إِنَّ الغِسْلَ مَا دُمْتِ أَيِّمًا
عَلَىَّ حَرَامٌ لَا يَمَسُّنِىَ الغِسْلُ
[And, O Leylà, (لَيْلَ being a contraction of لَيْلَى,
but in the O it is يا جُمْلُ O Juml,) verily the
wash for the head, as long as thou remainest
husbandless, shall be unlawful to me: the wash
for the head shall not touch me]: i. e. I will not
need the wash for the head by my جِمَاع of other
