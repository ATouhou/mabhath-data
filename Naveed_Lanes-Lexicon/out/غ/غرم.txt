requiring punishment (TA:) a debt, (S, TA:)
a fine, or mulet: (MA:) the pl. of ↓ مَغْرَمٌ is
مَغَارِمُ, agreeably with analogy; or this is pl. of
غُرْمٌ, anomalously, like as مَحَاسِنُ is of حُسْنٌ.
(TA.) [See exs. voce غَلِقَ: and see also غُنْمٌ.]
غَرْمَى A woman heavy, or sluggish; syn. ثَقِيلَةٌ:

possessive epithet signifying ذُو غَرَامٍ or غَرَامَةٍ or
تَغْرِيمٍ. (TA.) And (sometimes, S) it signifies
A creditor also: (S, Msb, K:) thus having two
contr. meanings; (K) Kutheiyir says,

* وَعَزَّةُ مَمْطُولٌ مُعَنًّى غَرِيمُهَا
[Every debtor has paid, and fully rendered to
his creditor; but as to Azzeh CCC, her creditor is put
off, and wearied]. (S.) The pl. of غَرِيمٌ is غُرَمَآءُ
(I Ath, Msb, TA) and غُرَّامٌ, which is a strange
[i. e. an anomalous] pl., (I Ath, TA;) or this is
pl. of ↓ غَارِمٌ as syn. with غَرِيمٌ [and thus is agree
able with analogy]; or it is pl. of ↓ مُغْرِمٌ [signifying “ burdened with debt. ”], formed by the rejection of the augmentative letter [of the sing].
