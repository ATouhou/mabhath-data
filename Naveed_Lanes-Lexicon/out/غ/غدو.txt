غدو1
غَدَا, (S, M, Msb, K,) aor. يَغْدُو, (S, M,
Msb,) inf. n. عُدُوٌّ (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K) and غَدْوٌ
(M, TA, and so accord. to the CK instead of غُدُوٌّ
[which is the only inf. n. commonly known]) and
غُدْوَةٌ, (K,) He went, or went away, in the time
called غُدْوَة, (Mgh, Msb,) i. e. [the early part of
the morning,] the period between the prayer of
daybreak and sunrise: this is the primary signification: (Msb:) or i. q. بَكَّرَ [he went forth
early in the morning; in the first part of the
day; or between the time of the prayer of daybreak and sunrise]; so in the phrase غَدَا عَلَيْهِ
[he went forth early in the morning, &c., to him,
or it]; (K;) as also ↓ اغتدى: (S, * K:) and
↓ غاداهُ signifies the same as غَدَا عَلَيْهِ; (S;) or
the same as بَاكَرَهُ [which is syn. with بَكَّرَ عَلَيْهِ as
expl. above; and signifies also, like بَكَّرَ عَلَيْهِ, he
hastened to it, or to do it, at any time, morning
or evening]: (ISd, K, TA:) الغُدُوُّ is the contr
of الرَّوَاحُ [inf. n. of رَاحَ]. (S.) Hence, in the
Kur [lxviii. 22], أَنِ اغْدُوا عَلَى حَرْثِكُمْ [Saying,
Go ye forth early, &c., to your land's produce]:
and the saying of a poet,
وَالطَّيْرُ فِى وُكُنَاتِهَا ↓ وَقَدْ أَغْتَدِى
[And sometimes, or often, I go forth early, &c.,
while the birds are in their nests]. (TA.) ―
-b2-
Afterwards, by reason of frequency of use, it
became employed as meaning He went, or went
away, or departed, at any time. (Mgh, * Msb,
TA.) Hence the saying, (Mgh, Msb,) of the
Prophet, (Msb,) in a trad., (Mgh,) اُغْدُ يَا أُنَيْسُ,
(Mgh, Msb,) meaning Depart then, O (??)
(Msb.) ―
-b3-  [Freytag bas erroneously assigned to
it another meaning, i. e. “ Nutrivit ” misled by
his finding تَغْدُوْ put for تَغْذُو in art. طلى in the
CK.] ―
-b4-  غَدِىَ: see 5.
2
غَدَّيْتُهُ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَغْدِيَةٌ, (Msb,
K,) I fed him with the meal called غَدَآء [q. v.].
(S, * Msb, K.)
3
غَاْدَوَ see 1, first sentence. One says, أَنَا أُعَادِيهِ
وَأُرَاوِحُهُ expl. in the first paragraph of art. روح.
5
تغدّى [He ate the meal called غَدَآء, q. v.;
properly,] he ate in the first part of the day; (S,
Msb, * K;) as also ↓ غَدِىَ, (IKtt, K, TA,) inf. n.
غَدًا. (TK: but in the TA written غداء.) When
it is said to thee, تَغَدَّ [Eat thou the غَدَآء], thou
sayest, مَا بِى مِنْ تَغَدٍّ [I have no desire for eating
the غَدَآء]; and not مَا بِى غَدَآءٌ, for [the] غَدَآء is
the meal itself. (S, Msb. See also 5 in art. عشو.)
تَغَدَّى فِى رَمَضَانَ means تَسَحَّرَ [i. e. He ate the
meal, or drank the draught of milk, called سَحُور,
q. v.]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And تَغَدَّتِ الإِبِلُ means The
camels pastured in the first part of the day.
(AHn, TA.)
8
إِغْتَدَوَ see 1, first and second sentences.
[10. استغدى accord. to Freytag is syn. with
تَغَدَّى; but for this I do not find any authority.]
غَدٌ, meaning The morrow, the day next after
the present day, (Msb,) is originally ↓غَدْوٌ, (S,
Msb, K,) the و being elided, (S, Msb,) without
any substitution, (S,) and the د being made a
letter of declinability. (Msb.) And one says
غَدًا meaning [I will do such a thing, &c.,] tomorrow: and بَعْدَ غَدٍ the day after to-morrow.
(MA.) See also غَدَاةٌ. ―
-b2-  And its signification
has been extended so that it is applied to a remote
time that is expected, (Msb, TA,) and to a near
time. (Nh, TA.) ―
-b3-  It is not used in its complete
form except in poetry: (Nh, TA:) Lebeed, (S,
TA,) or Dhu-r-Rummeh, (TA,) has thus used it
in his saying,
وَمَا النَّاسُ إِلَّا كَالدِّيَارِ وَأَهْلُهَا
بَلَاقِعُ ↓ بِهَا يَوْمَ حَلُّوهَا وَغَدْوًا
[And mankind are no other than the like of dwellings, the occupants thereof being in them daring
the day in which they have alighted in them, and
to-morrow they are vacant]: (S, TA:) or, accord.
to the M, one says, هٰذَا عَدُكَ and ↓ هٰذَا غَدْوُكَ
[This is thy morrow]. (TA.) ―
-b4-  It has no diminutive. (Sb, S, in art. امس.)
غَدْوٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in there
places.
غَدَاةٌ: see غُدْوَةٌ, in four places: though [properly] fem., and not heard as made mase., it may
be made mase. if meant to be understood as signifying the “ first part of the day: ” (IAmb,
Msb:) it is originally غَدَوَةٌ, because its pl. is
غَدَوَاتٌ. (IHsh, TA.) One says, ↓ آتِيكَ غَدَاةَ غَدٍ
[I will come to thee in the early part of the morning, &c., of to-morrow]. (S, TA.) بِالْغَدَاةِ وَالْعَشِىِّ
in the Kur [vi. 52 and xviii. 27] means After the
prayer of daybreak and [after] the prayer of [the
period of the afternoon called] the عَصْر: or,
accord. to some, [it means in the morning and the
evening, or rather in the forenoon and the afternoon, for they say that] it denotes constancy of
religious service: Ibn-'Ámir and Aboo-'Abd-erRahmán Es-Sulamee read وَالْعَشِىِّ ↓ بِالْغُدْوَةِ; but
the former is the common reading; and A 'Obeyd
says, we think that they read thus following the
handwriting, for it is written in all the copies of
the Kur-án with و like الصَّلَوة and الزَّكَوة, and
this is not an indication of the reading [which
they have adopted], as the و in الصلوة and الزكوة
is not pronounced [otherwise than as an] of prolongation except that it requires the fet-hah that
follows to be uttered with a somewhat broad
sound]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  هُوَ ابْنُ غَدَاتَيْنِ means He is
a son of two days [i. e. he is two days old]. (TA.)
―
-b3-  The dim. is ↓ غُدَيَّةٌ: (TA:) or this is the
dim. of ↓ غُدْوَةٌ: (EM p. 56:) one says, أَرْكَبُ
إِلَيْهِ غُدَيَّةً [I will ride to him, or it, in a short
period of an early part of a morning, &c.]: and
one says also, ↓ ذَتَيْتُهُ غُدَيَّانَاتٍ [I came to him, or
it, in short periods of early parts of mornings,
&c.]; an anomalous [pl.] dim. like عُشَيَّانَات;
both of which are mentioned by Sb. (TA.)
غَدْوَةٌ A journey in the first part of the day:
[an inf. n. un. of غَدَا:] opposed to رَوْحَةٌ. (TA.)
―
-b2-  See also the next paragraph. ―
-b3-  And see غَدَآءٌ.
غُدْوَةٌ, (S, Msb, K, &c.,) and ↓ غَدْوَةٌ, said by
MF to be well known, and ↓ غِدْوَةٌ, said by him
to be rare, or disapproved, (TA,) The early part
of the morning; the first part of the day; (K;)
or the period between the time of the prayer of
daybreak and sunrise; (S, Msb, K;) as also
↓ غَدَاةٌ, and ↓ غَدِيَّةٌ, (K, TA,) the last [in the CK
غَدْيَةِ, but correctly] a dial. var. of غُدْوَةٌ, like
ضَحِيَّةٌ a dial. var. of ضَحْوَةٌ: (IAar, TA:) or
↓ غَدَاةٌ is syn. with ضَحْوَةٌ [meaning the early
part of the forenoon, after sunrise; accord. to
some, when the sun is yet low; or, accord. to
others, when the sun is somewhat high]: (Msb:)
[it may therefore be generally rendered morning,
before, or after, sunrise:] the pls. are غُدًى, which
is pl. of غُدْوَةٌ; (S, Msb, TA;) and غَدَوَاتٌ, (S,
Msb, K, TA,) which is pl. of ↓ غَدَاةٌ; (S, Msb,
TA;) and ↓ غُدُوٌّ, (K, TA,) which is a pl. of غُدْوَةٌ,
formed by rejecting the ة [of the sing.], or, accord.
to the M, an anomalous pl. of ↓ غَدَاةٌ, or, as J
says, [in the S,] referring to the phrase بِالْغَدُوِّ
وَالْآصَالِ, in the Kur [vii. 204 and xiii. 16 and
xxiv. 36], بِالغُدُوِّ there means بِالغَدَوَاتِ, and is
a verb [i. e. an inf. n.] used to denote the time,
as [is طُلُوع] in the saying طُلُوعَ الشَّمْسِ
meaning فِى وَقْتِ طُلُوعِ الشمس; (TA;) and
غَدِيَّاتٌ, (IAar, K, TA, [in the CK, erroneously,
غَدَياتٌ,]) which is pl. of ↓ غَدِيَّةٌ; (TA;) and
غَدَايَا, (K, TA,) which is likewise a pl. of ↓ غَدِيَّةٌ,
accord. to IAar, and, if so, regularly formed from
غَدَايِوُ, in the same manner as has already been
expl. in the case of عَشَايَا [pl. of عَشِيَّةٌ, q. v. voce
عَشِىٌّ]; by some said to be a pl. of غُدْوَةٌ, but this
has been controverted by IHsh in the Expos. of
the “ Kaabeeyeh ” and by its commentator ['AbdEl-Kádir] El-Baghdádee; (TA;) or غَدَايَا is
not used except in conjunction with عَشَايَا; (K,
TA;) one says, إِنِّى لَآتِيهِ بِالغَدَايَا وَالعَشَايَا [Verily
I come to him in the early parts of mornings and
in the late parts of evenings], for the purpose of
conformity. (S, TA.) Zj says that when غُدْوَة
means The بُكْرَة [or early part of the morning,
&c.,] of the present day, or of a particular day,
it is imperfectly decl.: and AHei says that it is
thus accord. to the opinion commonly obtaining,
as is also بُكْرَة, each as being a generic proper
name, like أُسَامَةُ; and that when you mean to
generalize, you say, غُدْوَةٌ وَقْتُ نَشَاطٍ [An early
part of a morning is a time of briskness, liveliness,
or sprightliness]; and when you mean to particularize, لَأَسِيرَنَّ اللَّيْلَةَ إِلَى غُدْوَةَ [I will assuredly
journey to-night until the early part of the morning]: (TA:) [in the latter case also] one says,
أَتَيْتُهُ غُدْوَةَ [I came to him in the early part of the
morning of this, or of a particular, day]; غدوة
being here imperfectly decl. because it is determinate, like سَحَرَ; but it is of those adv. ns. that
may be used otherwise than as adv. ns.: you say,
سِيرَ عَلَى فَرَسِكَ غُدْوَةَ and غُدْوَةً [i. e. Journeying
was performed on thy horse, or mare, in the غُدْوَة
of this, or of a particular, day, and in a غُدْوَة,]
and غُدْوَةٌ and غُدْوَةٌ [i. e. the journey of the غُدْوَة
of this, or of a particular, day, and the journey
of a غُدْوَة, was performed (lit. was journeyed) on
thy horse, or mare, غُدْوَةُ and غُدْوَةٌ being for. مَسِيرَةُ
غُدْوَةَ and مَسِيرَةُ غُدْوَةٍ, like as شَهْرٌ in the Kur
xxxiv. 11 is for مَسِيرَةُ شَهْرٍ]; what is with tenween, of these, being indeterminate, and what is
without tenween being determinate. (S. [In one
of my copies of the S, سِرْ is put in the place of سِيرَ:
that the latter is the right is shown by the addition of غُدْوَةُ and غُدْوَةٌ; for each of these must be
what is termed نَائِبٌ عَنْ فَاعِلٍ i. e. a substitute for
an agent.]) See also غَدَاةٌ, in two places.
غِدْوَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
غَدَوِىٌّ: see غَدِىٌّ. ―
-b2-  Also Whatever [offspring]
is in [any of] the bellies of pregnant animals (AO,
K, TA) of camels and of sheep or goats: (AO,
TA:) or peculiarly of sheep or goats; (K, TA;)
thus in the dial. of the Prophet: (TA:) or it
[virtually, in a trad. mentioned in what follows,]
means the selling a camel, or other [animal], for
what the stallion begets: or the selling a sheep for
the offspring begotten by the ram: (K:) in all of
which senses غَذِىٌّ and غَذَوِىٌّ are [said to be]
syn.: (K in art. غذو:) or غَدَوِىٌّ, (TA,) or غَذَوِىٌّ,
or, as some relate a verse of El-Farezdak in which
it occurs, غَدَوِىٌّ, (S in art. غذو,) means the selling a thing for the offspring begotten by the ram
[or, as appears from what follows, by the stallioncamel] in that year: غَدَوِىٌّ being a rel. n. from
غَدٌ: as though they rendered one desirous by
saying, “Our camels will bring forth and we
will give thee to-morrow (غَدًا): ” (S in art. غذو,
and TA:) what is thus termed is forbidden in a
trad.: a man used to buy, for a camel or a she-goat or money, what was in the bellies of pregnant animals; and this is a hazardous proceeding,
and was therefore forbidden. (Nh, TA.) See also
art. غذو. ―
-b3-  And see عَدَوِيَّةٌ, in art. عدو.
غَدْيَانُ Eating the meal called غَدَآء: (S, K: *)
fem. غَدْيَا, of the measure فَعْلَى, applied to a
woman; (S;) or غَدْيَآءُ: (so in copies of the K:)
they are originally with و [in the place of the ى],
on the ground of preference, as is said in the M:
and غَدْيَانَةٌ is mentioned by Z, as applied to a
woman, coupled with عَشْيَانَةٌ. (TA.)
غَدَآءٌ The morning-meal, that is eaten between
daybreak and sunrise; i. e. the meal, or repast,
of the غُدْوَة; (K;) or of the غَدَاة; (Msb;) the
meal, or repast, that is the contr. of the عَشآء:
(S:) [it may therefore be rendered breakfast:
but it is now commonly applied to dinner, which
is eaten soon after the prayer of noon, and which
is a lighter repast than the عَشَآء, i. e. supper:]
الغدوة [app. ↓ الغَدْوَةُ] as meaning الغَدَآءُ is vulgar:
(TA voce عَشْوَةٌ:) the pl. of غَدَآءٌ is أَغْذِيَةٌ. (K.)
And The [meal, or the draught of milk, called]
سَحُور is thus termed; because it is to the person
fasting the like of what it is to him who is not
fasting. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also The pasture of camels in
the first part of the day. (TA.)
غُذُوٌّ: see غُدْوَةٌ.
غَدِىٌّ Of, or relating to, the morrow; the
rel. n. from غَدٌ; as also ↓ غَدَوىٌّ; (S, K;) the
latter allowable. (S.) ―
-b2-  See also عَدَويَّةٌ, in art.
عدو.
غَدِيَّةٌ: see its syn. غُدْوَةٌ, in three places.
غُدَيَّةٌ: and see غَدَاةٌ, last sentence.
غُدَيَّانَاتٌ: see غَدَاةٌ, last sentence.
الغَادِى The lion: (K, TA:) because he goes
forth in the early part of the morning against the
prey. (TA.)
غَادِيَةٌ A cloud that rises (S, K) in the صَبَاح (S)
or in the غُدْوَة (K) [i. e. in the first part of the
day]: or a rain of the [period of the morning
called] غَدَاة: (K, TA:) thus says Lh: the pl. is
غَوَادٍ. (TA.) [See a verse in the Ham p. 429.]
مَغْدًى and ↓ مَغْدَاةٌ [A place to which people go,
or to which they return, in the period of the morning called غُدْوَة; opposed to مَرَاحٌ and مَرَاحَةٌ]. ―
-b2-
[Hence] one says, مَا تَرَكَ فُلَانٌ مِنْ أَبِيهِ مَغْدًى
وَلَا مَرَاحًا, and وَلَا مَرَاحَةً ↓ مَغْدَاةً, expl. in art.
روح. (S in art. روح, and K in the present art.)
مَغْدَاةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in
two places.
