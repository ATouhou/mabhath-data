in a filled river (or canal)]. (S.) ―
-b4-  Hence, (TA,)
إِغْرَابٌ signifies also Abundance of wealth, and
goodliness of condition: (K, TA:) because abundance of wealth fills the hands of the possessor
thereof, and goodliness of condition fills [with
satisfaction] the soul of the goodly person. (TA.)
[Therefore the verb, meaning He was endowed
(as though filled) with abundance of wealth and
with goodliness of condition, is app. أُغْرِبَ; not (as

was done to him; and [it is said that] أُغْرِبَ بِهِ

is, he did [to him] a foul, or an evil, deed. (TA.)
―
-b7-  And أُغْرِبَ said of a horse, His blaze spread

-A2-  And الغَرْبُ is syn. with
↓ المَغْرِبُ, (S, M, Msb, K,) which latter is also
pronounced ↓ المَغْرَبُ, with fet-h to the ر, but
more commonly with kesr, (Msb,) or accord. to
analogy it should be with fet-h, but usage has
given it kesr, as in the case of المَشْرِقُ; (TA;)
[both signify The west;] الغَرْبُ is the contr. of
الشَّرْقُ; (M, TA;) and ↓ المَغْرِبُ [is the contr. of
المَشْرِقُ, and] originally signifies the place [or
point] of sunset, (TA,) as also الشَّمْسِ ↓ مَغْرِبَانُ;
(K;) and is likewise used to signify the time of
sunset; and also as an inf. n.: (TA:) and
↓ المَغْرِبَانِ signifies the two places [or points]

meaning (assumed tropical:)  sharpness of temper or the like, passionateness, irritability, or vehemence,] of a man,
(TA,) and of a horse, (S, TA,) and of youth:
(A, TA:) [from the same word signifying the
“ edge ” of a sword &c.: whence the saying, أَرْهِفْ
غَرْبَ ذِهْنِكَ لَمَا أَقُولُ (mentioned in the A and TA
in art. ارهف) meaning (tropical:)  Sharpen the edge of thine
intellect for what I say:] and ↓ غَرْبَةٌ signifies

called] رَاوِيَة, (K, TA,) upon which water is carried. (TA.) ―

Umm-'Amr but thine eyes have tears flowing?].
(S, TA.) And it is said of Ibn-'Abbás, in a trad.,
كَانَ مِثَجًّا يَسِيلُ غَرْبًا i. e. (tropical:)  [He was an eloquent
orator, flowing with] a copious and uninterrupted
stream of knowledge, likened to غَرْب as meaning

collects and remains: (K, TA:) or the غَرْب in a

غُرُوبٌ, (S, TA,) signifies the sharpness, and مَآء
[meaning lustre], (S, TA,) of the tooth, (TA,) or
of the teeth: (S, TA:) accord. to the T and M
and Nh and L, غُرُوبُ الأَسْنَانِ signifies the places
where the saliva of the teeth collects and remains:
or, as some say, their extremities and sharpness
and مَآء [which may here mean either water or

TA:) or their fineness, or thinness, and sharpness: or غُرُوبٌ signifies the sharp, or serrated,
edges of the fore teeth: it is also, as pl. of غَرْبٌ,
expl. as signifying the مَآء of the فَم [by which may
be meant either the water of the mouth or the
lustre of the teeth, for الفَمُ properly signifies “ the
mouth ” and metonymically “ the teeth ”], and
the sharpness of the teeth: and accord. to MF, as
on the authority of the Nh, [but SM expresses
a doubt as to its correctness,] it is also applied to
the teeth [themselves]. (TA.) [See also شَنَبٌ,
in two places.]
-A6-  أَصَابَهُ سَهْمُ غَرْبٍ and ↓ سَهْمُ غَرَبٍ,

-A7-  And غَرْبٌ signifies also A
certain tree of El-Hijáz, (K, TA,) green, (TA,)
large, or thick, and thorny, (K, TA,) whence is
made [or prepared] the كُحَيْل [i. e. tar] with
which [mangy] camels are smeared: [or it is a
coll. gen. n., for] its n. un. is with ة: so says
ISd: كحيل is قَطِرَان, of the dial. of El-Hijáz:
and he [app. ISd] says also, the أَبْهَل [q. v.] is
the same as the غَرْب, because قطران is extracted
from it. (TA.) Hence, as some say, (K, TA,)
the trad., (TA,) لَا يَزَالُ أَهْلُ الغَرْبِ ظَاهِرِينَ عَلَى
الحَقِّ [The people of the غرب will not cease to be
attainers of the truth, or of the true religion]:
(K, TA:) or the meaning is, the people of Syria,
because Syria is [a little to the] west of El-Hijáz:
or the people of sharpness, and of vehemence of
might or strength, or of valour or prowess; i. e.
the warriors against unbelievers: or the people of
the bucket called غَرْب; i. e. the Arabs: or the
people of the west; which meaning is considered
by Iyád and others the most probable, because,
in the relation of the trad. by Ed-Dárakutnee, the
word in question is المَغْرِب. (L, TA.)
غُرْبٌ: see غُرْبَةٌ.
غَرَبٌ Silver: or a [vessel such as is termed] جَام
of silver; (S, K;) [i. e.] a [drinking-cup or bowl
such as is termed] قَدَح of silver. (L, TA.) A
poet says,
فَدَعْدَعَا سُرَّةَ الرَّكَآءِ كَمَا
دَعْدَعَ سَاقِى الأَعَاجِمِ الغَرَبَا
cited in the S as being by El-Aashà but it is
said in the L, IB says, this verse is by Lebeed,
not by El-Aashà, describing two torrents meeting
together; meaning, And they filled the middle of
the valley of Er-Rehà, also, but less correctly,
called Er-Rikà, like as the cup-bearer of the
اعاجم [or foreigners] fills the silver قَدَح with
wine: the verse of El-Aashà in which [it is said
that] غَرَب occurs as meaning “ silver ” is,
إِذَا انْكَبَّ أَزْهَرُ بَيْنَ السُّقَاةِ
تَرَامَوْا بِهِ غَرَبًا وَنُضَارَا
i. e. When a white wine-jug is turned down so as
to pour out its contents [among the cup-bearers],
they hand it, i. e. the wine in the cups, one to
another [while it resembles silver or gold]: (L,
TA:) غَرَبًا is here in the accus. case as a denotative of state, though signifying a substance: [and
so نُضَارَا:] but it is said that غَرَبٌ and نُضَارٌ signify
species of trees from which are made [drinkingcups or bowls such as are termed] أَقْدَاح [pl. of
قَدَحٌ]: and it is said in the T that نُضَارٌ signifies
a species of trees from which are made yellow
أَقْدَاح. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [In explanation of the last of
the applications of غَرَبٌ mentioned above, it is
said that] it signifies also A species of trees (T,
S, ISd, TA) from which are made white [drinking-cups or bowls of the kind termed] أَقْدَاح; (T,
TA;) called in Pers. إِسبِيدْ دَار [or إِسْپِيدَار]: (S:)
[generally held to mean the willow; like the
Hebr.
עֲרָבִי�; or particularly the species called
salix Babylonica: a coll. gen. n.:] n. un. with ة.
(ISd, TA.) [Avicenna (Ibn-Seenà), in book ii.
p. 279, mentions a tree called غرب, but describes
only the uses and supposed properties of its bark
&c., particularizing its صَمْغ; whence it appears
that he means the غَرْب, not the غَرَب.] ―
-b3-  It also
signifies A [vessel of the kind termed] قَدَح [perhaps such as is made from the species of trees
above mentioned]: (K, TA:) and its pl. is أَغْرَابٌ.
(TA.) ―
-b4-  And Gold. (K.) ―
-b5-  And Wine. (S,
K.) ―
-b6-  And The water that drops from the
buckets between the well and the watering-trough
or tank, (S, K,) and which soon alters in odour:
(S:) or any water that pours from the buckets
from about the mouth of the well to the wateringtrough or tank, and that soon alters in odour: or
the water and mud that are around the well and
the watering-trough or tank: (TA:) and (as
some say, TA) the odour of water and mud:
(K:) so called because it soon alters. (TA.)
[Hence] one says, لا تغرب, [thus in the TA, so

-b3-  أَسْوَدُ غِرْبِيبٌ
means Intensely black: but if you say غَرَابِيبُ
سُودٌ, you make the latter word a substitute for
the former; because a word corroborative of one

or, accord. to Hr, غَرَابِيبُ سُودٌ [in the Kur xxxv.
25], relating to mountains, means Streaks having
black rocks. (TA.)

was used as a proper name, which, as is said in
a trad., he [i. e. Mohammad] changed, because
the word implies the meaning of distance, and
because it is the name of a foul bird: (TA:)

fly away; because of its abundant herbage: see
also طَيَّرَ]: and وَجَدَ ثَمَرَةَ الغُرَابِ (assumed tropical:)  [He found the
fruit of the crow]; because that bird seeks after
and chooses the most excellent of fruits. (TA.)
They also say, طَارَ غُرَابُ فُلَانٍ (tropical:)  [The crow of such
a one flew away], meaning the head of such a one
became white, or hoary. (A, TA. [See also a

Khufáf Ibn-Nudbeh (asserted to have been a
Mukhadram, TA) and Aboo-'Omeyr Ibn-El-
Hobáb and Suleyk Ibn-Es-Sulakeh (a famous

is [commonly] known by the name of عود القرح

meaning (tropical:)  The affair was, or became, difficult, or
strait, to him: (A, * K:) or his life, or subsistence,
was, or became, so. (TA.) [And in like manner
one says also أَصَرَّ, accord. to the TA: but this I
think doubtful; believing that أَصَرَّ is a mistranscription for صَرَّ, meaning that one says also صَرَّ
عَلَيْهِ رِجْلَ الغُرَابِ i. e. He bound him with a bond
not to be undone, or that would not undo; or he
straitened him. See, again, رِجْلٌ; and a verse

the haunch, on the right and left, meet: (TA:)
or the two extremities of the haunch that are

referring to camels,
تَقَوَّبَ عَنْ غِرْبَانِ أَوْرَاكِهَا الخَطْرُ
meaning تَقَوَّبَتْ غِرْبَانُهَا عَنِ الخَطْرِ [The prominences of their haunches were excoriated from
the lashing with the tails], the phrase being inverted, for the meaning is known; (S in this
art.;) or تَقَوَّبَ may be for قَوَّبَ [i. e. the saying
means the lashing with the tails excoriated the
prominences of the haunches]: (S in art. خطر:)
or غِرْبَانٌ signifies the haunches themselves, of
camels: and is employed [by a synecdoche] to

غُرُوبٌ pl. of غَرْبٌ [q. v.]. ―
-b2-  [Golius assigns to
it the meaning of وِهَادٌ, which he renders “ Depressiores terræ; ” as on the authority of J: but I do
not find this in the S.]
غَرِيبٌ (S, Msb, K) and ↓ غُرُبٌ (S, K) and

[A stranger, or foreigner;] one far, or distant,

لَأَضْرِبَنَّكُمْ ضَرْبَ غَرِيبَةِ الإِبِلِ (tropical:)  [I will assuredly beat
you with the beating of the strange one of the
camels] is a saying of El-Hajjáj threatening the
subjects of his government; meaning, as a strange
camel, intruding among others when they come
to water, is beaten and driven away. (IAth,
TA.) And [hence] قِدْحٌ غَرِيبٌ means (assumed tropical:)  [An
arrow, without feathers or head,] such as is not
of the same trees whereof are the rest of the
arrows. (TA.) ―
-b2-  غَرِيبٌ signifies also Language

-A2-  [The
fem.] غَرِيبَةٌ, in a verse of Aboo-Kebeer El-Hudhalee, as some relate it, is expl. by Skr as meaning Black; syn. سَوْدَآءُ. (TA voce عَزِيزَةُ [q. v.
It is perhaps used by poetic license for غِرْبِيبَةٌ,
fem. of غِرْبِيبٌ.])
غَرِيبَةٌ fem. of غَرِيبٌ [q. v.] ―
-b2-  [Hence, as a
subst.,] الغَرِيبَةُ signifies (tropical:)  The hand-mill: so called
because the neighbours borrow it, (A, K, TA.)
and thus it does not remain with its owners.
(A, TA.)
غُرَابِىٌّ A sort of dates. (AHn, K, TA. [See

TA;) upon which the leading-rope is thrown when
the camel is sent to pasture where he will: (Msb:)

-b2-  Hence the saying, (S,
&c.,) حَبْلُكِ عَلَى غَارِبِكِ [Thy rope is upon thy
withers]; (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K, TA;) used (Msb,
TA) by the Arabs in the Time of Ignorance (TA)
in divorcing; (Msb, TA;) meaning (tropical:)  I have left
thy way free, or open, to thee; (TA;) go whithersoever thou wilt: (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K, TA:)
originating from the fact of throwing a she-camel's leading-rope upon her withers, if it is
upon her, when she pastures; for when she sees
the leading-rope, nothing is productive of enjoyment to her. (As, S, TA.) ―
-b3-  الغَارِبَانِ signifies
The fore and kind parts of the back [and of the
hump]: and بَعِيرٌ ذُو غَارِبَيْنِ, A camel whereof the

ceased not to twist the fur of] the upper part and
the fore part of the hump [until 'Áïsheh gave him
her consent to go forth]; meaning, he ceased not
to practise guile with her, and to wheedle her,
until she gave hun her consent: originating from
the fact that, when a man desires to render a
refractory camel tractable, and to attach to him
the nose-rein, he passes his hand over him, and
strokes his غارب, and twists its fur, until he has
become familiar: (L, TA:) or غَارِبٌ signifies the

a word other than that which is its proper source
of derivation; being as though formed from
↓ مَغْرِبَانٌ. (S, L. [Hence it seems that this last
word as given above was unknown to, or not
admitted by, the authors of these two works.])
―
-b2-  مَغْرِبٌ signifies also Anything [meaning any
place] that conceals, veils, or covers, one: pl.
