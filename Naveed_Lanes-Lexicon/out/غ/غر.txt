غر1
غَرَّهُ, aor. يَغُرُّ, inf. n. غُرُورٌ (Fr, S, Msb, K)
and غَرٌّ, (Az, K,) which latter is preferable to the
former, [though less common,] because the inf. n.
of a trans. verb is scarcely ever of the measure
فُعُولٌ, (Az,) and غِرَّةٌ (Lh, K) and غَرَرٌ, (IKtt,
TA,) He (the devil, TA) deceived him; beguiled
him; (S, K;) made him to desire what was vain,
or false. (K.) You say غَرَّتْهُ الدُّنْيَا The world
deceived him, or beguiled him, by its finery, or
show, or pomp. (Msb.) It is said in the Kur
[lxxxii. 6], مَا غَرَّكَ بِرَبِّكَ What hath deceived thee,
and led thee into error, so that thou hast neglected
what was incumbent on thee to thy Lord? (Aboo-Is-hák:) or what hath deceived thee respecting
thy Lord, and induced thee to disobey Him, and to
feel secure from his punishment? (TA:) or what
hath deceived thee, and emboldened thee to disobey
thy Lord? (Bd. [But see بِ as syn. with عَنْ.])
مَا غَرَّكَ بِفُلَانٍ signifies [What hath deceived thee,
and emboldened thee against such a one? or] how
is it that thou art emboldened against such a
one? (As, S, Msb, TA.) [See also 4.] And مَنْ
غَرَّكَ بِفُلَانٍ, (TA,) and مِنْ فُلَانٍ, (S, TA,) Who
hath made thee to pursue a course without being
rightly directed, or a course not plain, (مَنْ أَوْطَأَكَ
عُشْوَةً, S, TA,) with respect to such a one, (S,) or
with respect to the case of such a one? (TA. [See
again 4.]) [Also غُرَّ مِنْ فُلَانٍ, i. e. غُرَّ غُرُورًا صَادِرًا
مِنْ فُلَانٍ, He was deceived by such a one; he was
deceived with deceit proceeding from such a one.
See غَرِيرٌ, as syn. with مَغْرُورٌ.] And غَرَّ فُلَانٌ فُلَانًا
Such a one exposed such a one to perdition or destruction [app. by deceiving him]. (TA. [See
also 2, and 4.]) Also Such a one acted with such
a one in a manner resembling the slaying with the
edge of the sword. (TA. [See 3 in art. عطو.])
-A2-  غَرَّ فَرْخَهُ, (S, O, K,) aor.
غَرُ3َ, (S, O,) inf. n. غَرٌّ
(S, O, K) and غِرَارٌ, (O, K, [or the latter is inf. n.
of غَارَّ only,]) It (a bird, S, O, K, * or a pigeon,
TA) fed its young one with its bill: (S, O, K:)
and أُنْثَاهُ ↓ غارّ, (As, S, K,) inf. n. غِرَارٌ (S) or مُغَارَّةٌ,
(TA,) he (the [collared turtle-dove called] قُمْرِىّ)
fed his female with his bill. (As, S, K.) ―
-b2-
Hence, in a trad., كَانَ يَغُرُّ عَلِيًّا (O, TA) بِالعِلْمِ
(TA) (assumed tropical:)  He (the Prophet) used to nourish 'Alee
with knowledge like as the bird feeds its young one.
(O, TA. *) And one says, غُرَّ فُلَانٌ مِنَ العِلْمِ مَا لَمْ
يُغَرُّهُ غَيْرُهُ (assumed tropical:)  Such a one has been nourished, and
instructed, with that wherewith other than he has
not been nourished, and instructed, of knowledge.
(TA.)
-A3-  غَرَّ, aor. يَغِرُّ, (S, Msb,) with kesr; (S;)
or غَرَّ, see. pers. غَرِرْتَ, aor. يَغَرُّ; (K, TA;) inf. n.
غَرَارَةٌ; (S, Msb, K;) He (a man, S, Msb, or a
youth, or young man, K) was inexperienced in
affairs; (S, K;) he was ignorant of affairs;
negligent, or heedless, of them. (Msb.) You say
كَانَ ذٰلِكَ فِى غَرَارَتِى وَحَدَاثَتِى, i. e. فِى غِرَّتِى,
That was in [the time of] my inexperience and
youth. (S.) [See also 8.] ―

He acted in a youthful or childish manner:
(IAar, T, TA:) or he so acted after having
soundness of judgment, produced by experience.
(Sgh, K.) But this is at variance with what J
cites from Fr, in art. شد, that the aor. of an
intrans. verb of this class of the measure فَعَلَ,
should be of the measure يَفْعِلُ, with kesr to the
ع. (TA.)
-A4-  غَرَّ, (IAar, IKtt, K,) in one place
written by IAar غَرِرَ, to show that it is of the
measure فَعِلَ, and that the sec. pers. is غَرِرْتَ,
(TA,) aor. يَغَرُّ, (IAar, IKtt, K,) inf. n. غَرَرٌ
(IAar, K) and غُرَّةٌ, (IAar, IKtt, K,) or the
latter, as ISd thinks, is not an inf. n., but a
subst., (TA,) and غَراَرَةٌ, (K,) He (a horse, IAar,
IKtt, and a camel, IAar) had what is termed a
غُرَّة upon his forehead: (IAar, IKtt:) it (his
face) had what is so termed: (K:) it (his face)
became white. (IAar, K. *) ―
-b2-  غَرَّ, aor. يَغَرُّ, He
(a man) became eminent, or noble. (TA.) ―

inf. n. تَغْرِيرٌ and تَغِرَّةٌ, (S, K,) He exposed himself,
(K, TA,) and his property, (TA,) to perdition,
or destruction, or loss, (K, TA,) without knowing
it: (TA:) he endangered, jeoparded, hazarded,
or risked, himself, (S, TA,) [and his property,]
and was negligent, or heedless, of the end, issue, or
result, of an affair. (TA.) [See also 1.]
-A2-
غُزِّرَ He (a horse) was marked with a غُرَّة [i. e.
a star, or blaze, or white mark, on the forehead
or face]: you say بِمَ غُرِّرَ فَرَسُكَ With what kind
of غُرَّة is thy horse marked? and the owner
answers, With a شاَدِخَة, or with a وَتِيرَة, &c.
(Mubtekir El-Aarábee, TA.)
-A3-  غَرَّرَتْ ثَنِيَّتَا الغُلاَمٍ
The central incisors of the boy showed their points
for the first time: (S:) or غرّر الغُلاَمُ the first
of the teeth of the boy showed its point; as though
the غُرَّة, i. e. whiteness, of his teeth appeared: and
غَرَّرَتْ أَسْنَانُ الصَّبِىِّ the teeth of the boy were disposed to grow, and came forth. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And
hence, (TA,) غَرَّرَتِ الطَّيْرُ The birds desired, or endeavoured, to fly, and raised their wings. (K,
TA.)
-A4-  غرّر القِرْبَةَ (Sgh, K, TA) and السِّقَآءَ (TA)

غارّت النَّاقَةُ, (As, ISk, S, K,) aor. تُغَارُّ, inf. n.
غِرَارٌ, (ISk, S,) The she-camel became scant of
milk: (As, S, K:) or deficient in milk: (TA:)
or she took fright, and drew up her milk, (ISk,
S,) after yielding milk freely: (ISk, TA:) or
the she-camel, having yielded milk abundantly on
her teats' being stroked, and not being promptly
milked, drew up her milk, and would not yield it
plentifully until it collected again in her udder in
the interval before the next period of milking.
(Az.) [This signification of the verb is said in
the TA to be tropical: but I rather think it to be
proper; as the next is derived from it.] ―
-b2-
غارَّت السُّوقُ, aor. تُغَارُّ, (AZ, S,) inf. n. غِرَارٌ, (AZ,
S, K,) (tropical:)  The market became stagnant, or dull,

4
اغرّهُ He, or it, emboldened him, or encouraged him; [by deceiving him;] syn. أَجْسَرَهُ: so
says AHeyth; and he cites the following verse:
أَغَرَّ هِشَامًا مِنْ أَخِيهِ ابْنِ أُمِّهِ
قَوَادِمُ صَأْنٍ يَسَّرَتْ وَرَبِيعُ
meaning [The teats of sheep that have yielded
abundance of milk and of young, and spring
herbage, i. e.] the abundance of his sheep and
their milk, have emboldened Hishám against his
brother, the son of his mother, [to pursue a wrong
course towards him, and] to forsake him, thinking
himself in dependent of him: the poet makes قوادم
to belong to sheep, whereas they properly belong
to the udders of camels, using the word metaphorically. (TA.) [But I incline to think that
the أَ in أَغَرَّ is the interrogative particle, and that
its explanation is أَجَسَّرَ, with the same particle;
and the more so as I have not found any authority, if this be not one, for أَجْسَرَ in the sense of
جَسَّرَ: so that the meaning of the verse is, Have
the teats, &c.? and it shows that غَرَّهُ مِنْهُ, not
أَغَرَّهُ, means جَسَّرَهُ عَلَيْهِ, like غَرَّهُ بِهِ. See 1.] ―
-b2-
Also He caused him to fall into peril, danger,
jeopardy, hazard, or risk. (TA.) [But perhaps
this meaning is also derived from a misunderstanding of the verse quoted above. See again 1.]
8
اغترّ He became deceived, or beguiled; (S,
K;) made to desire what was vain, or false;
(K;) بِشَىْءٍ by a thing. (S.) [See also 10.] ―
-b2-
He was negligent, inattentive, inadvertent, inconsiderate, heedless, or unprepared; (S, K;) he
thought himself secure, and therefore was not on
his guard. (Msb.) [See again 10.]
-A2-  اغترَهُ He,
or it, came to him when he was negligent, inadvertent, heedless, or unprepared; (T, S, TA;) as
also ↓ استغرّهُ: (T, K, TA:) or he sought to avail
himself of his negligence, inadvertence, heedlessness,

عَلَى غَرِّهِ I folded the garment, or piece of cloth,

a female slave, (S, Msb, K,) or a clever female
slave: (Aboo-Sa'eed, Mgh:) its application to a
slave, male or female, [among articles of property,] is most common. (TA.) It has this last
signification (a male or female slave) in a trad. in
which it relates to the compensation for the destroying of a child in the womb: (TA:) as
though this term were applied, by a synecdoche,
to the whole person; (S;) the word properly signifying the “ face; ” in like manner as the terms

Ibn-El-Alà is related to have said that it there
means a white male slave or a white female slave:

and غِرَرٌ: see an ex. of the former in a verse cited
voce شَفَعَ, and exs. of both in a verse cited voce
دَرَى.] It is said in a prov., الغِرَّةُ تَجْلِبُ الدِّرَّةَ

-A2-  [See also غِرٌّ.]
غُرَّى: see أَغَرُّ, near the end.

risk. (S, Mgh, Msb, K.) It is said in a trad.,
نَهَى عَنْ بَيْعِ الغَرَرِ He (Mohammad) forbade the
sale of hazard, or risk; (S, Mgh, Msb;) of
which it is unknown whether the thing will be or
not; (Mgh;) such as the sale of fish in the water,
and of birds in the air: (S, Mgh:) or, accord. to
'Alee, in which one is not secure from being deceived: (Mgh:) or of which the outward semblance
deceives the buyer, and the intrinsic reality is unknown: (TA:) or that is without any written
statement (عُهْدَة), and without confidence. (As,
Mgh.) ―
-b2-  حَبْلٌ غَرَرٌ means غَيْرُ مَوْثُوقٍ بِهِ [i. e.,
app., A bond, or compact, in which trust, or confidence, is not placed]. (TA.)
-A2-  See also غَرِيرٌ.
غِرَارٌ Paucity of milk of a camel: (K:) or

milk preceded his paucity thereof]: (As:) or سَبَقَ
دِرَّتَهُ غِرَارُهُ [lit., his paucity of milk preceded his
abundance thereof; agreeably with an explanation
of Z, who says that it is applied to him who does
evil before he does good: see Freytag's Arab.
Prov. i. 613: and see also غِرَّةٌ]. (So in my
copies of the S.) ―
-b2-  Hence, (assumed tropical:)  Paucity of sleep.

-b3-  [Hence also,] in prayer,
(tropical:)  A deficiency in, (K,) or an imperfect performance
of, (S,) the bowing of the body, and the prostration,
(S, K,) and the purification. (K.) And in salutation, The saying (in reply to السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ)
وَعَلَيْكُمْ, not وَعَلَيْكُمُ السَّلَامُ: (T, TA:) or the saying سَلَامٌ عَلَيْكُمْ (K) or سَلَامٌ عَلَيْكَ (M) [without ال prefixed to سلام: as though it were a
deficient form; but it is the form specially sanctioned by the Kur-án]: or the replying by saying
عَلَيْكَ, not عَليْكُمْ. (K.) This is said in explanation of a trad., لاَ غِرَارَ فِى صَلَاةٍ وَلَا تَسْلِيمٍ [There
shall be no deficiency in prayer, nor in salutation]:
but accord. to one relation, it is لا غرار فى صلاة
ولا تَسْلِيمَ, meaning, that the person praying shall
not salute nor be saluted: in the former case,
تسليم is an adjunct to صلاة: in the latter, it is
an adjunct to غرار, so that the meaning is, There
shall be no deficiency nor salutation in prayer.

the space of a month. (S, O, TA.) And لَيْتَ اليَوْمَ

―
-b7-  And, accord. to As, غِرَارٌ signifies A way,

of the blade,] of a spear and of an arrow and of a

men by false promises and by inspiring hopes;

and this last sense it has, accord. to ISk, in the
Kur xxxi. 33 and xxxv. 5: (S:) also the present

الأَمْرِ, meaning I am one possessing knowledge in
this affair so that when thou askest me of it I will
inform thee respecting it without being prepared
for it and without consideration: so says AZ:
and Z says the like; i. e. I [am one who] will
answer thee if thou ask me unexpectedly respecting
this affair by reason of the soundness of my knowledge of the true state of the case: or [it means
I am a deceived informant of thee respecting this
affair; for] as As says, the meaning is, thou art
not deceived by me, but I am the person deceived;
the case being this, that false information came to
me, and I acquainted thee with it, and it was not
as I told thee; I having only related what I had
heard. (TA.) And one says, أَنَا غَرِيرُكَ مِنْهُ i. e.
I caution thee [or I am thy cautioner] against
him; (K, TA:) [i. e.,] مِنْ فُلَانٍ [against such a
one]; (S, O;) meaning, as Aboo-Nasr says in the
“ Kitáb el-Ajnás,” [that] there shall not happen
to thee, from him, that whereby thou shalt be
deceived; (S, O, TA;) as though he said, I am

larger than a دِرْهَم, in the middle of his forehead,
