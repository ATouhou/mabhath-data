غَمِزَ,
(Msb, K,) inf. n. غَمْزٌ, (TA,) He felt him, (namely,
a ram,) to know if he were fat: (S, A, Msb, K:)
and غَمَزَهَا he put his hand upon her (a camel's)

inf. n. غَمْزٌ, (A, K,) He pressed, or squeezed, it,
[with his hand,] namely, a limb, (A, K, TA,)
and a man's back. (TA.) So in a trad. of
'Omar: دَخَلَ عَلَيْهِ وَعِنْدَهُ غُلَيْمٌ يَغْمِزُ ظَهْرَهُ [He
went in to him, and with him was a little boy
pressing, or squeezing, or kneading, his back].
(TA.) And in a trad. respecting the ablution
termed الغُسْل, it is said, اِغْمِزِى قُرُونَكِ, meaning
Press thou, or squeeze thou, the locks of thy hair,
in washing. (TA.) You also say, غَمَزَ الثِّقَافُ القَنَاةَ
The straightening-instrument pinched and pressed
the spear. (A, * Mgh, TA. *) A poet (namely
Ziyád El-Aajam, TA) says,
وَكُنْتُ إِذَا غَمَزْتُ قَنَاةَ قَوْمٍ
كَسَرْتُ كُعُوبَهَا أَوْ تَسْتَقِيمَا
[And I used, when I pinched and pressed the
spear of a people, to break its knots, or internodal portions, unless it became straight]. (S, TA.
It is a prov., respecting which see remarks in
art. او.)
-A2-  غَمَزَ, (A, Msb,) and غَمَزَهُ, (S, Mgh,
K,) aor.
غَمِزَ, (Mgh, Msb, K,) inf. n. غَمْزٌ, (Msb,
TA,) (tropical:)  He made a sign, (A, Msb,) and he made
a sign to him, (Mgh, K, *) with the eye, (S, A,
Mgh, Msb, K,) or eyebrow, (A, Mgh, Msb, K,)
or eyelid [by winking]. (K.) So in the saying,
in a trad., غَمَزَنِى عَلِىٌّ أَنْ قُلْ نَعَمْ (tropical:)  '4lee made a
sign to me with the eye, or eyebrow, meaning,
Say thou Yes. (Mgh.) The people of the West
say, غَمَزَهُ فُلَانٌ بِفُلَانٍ, meaning, (tropical:)  Such a one
blinked towards such a one, to instigate him
against him, or in order that he should have
recourse to him for protection or the like, or seek
aid of him. (Mgh.) ―
-b2-  Hence, الغَمْزُ بِالنَّاسِ:

غَمِزَ, (K,) inf. n. غَمْزٌ,
(TA,) (tropical:)  He calumniated, or slandered, the man.

غَمِزَ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. غَمْزٌ, (S, Msb,) (assumed tropical:)  The
beast limped, or it halted, with its hind leg; had a
slight lameness thereof: (K, * TA:) or he had what
resembled عَرَج [or natural lameness] in his gait:
(Msb:) or, as IKtt says, غَمَزَتِ الدَّابَّةُ بِرِجْلِهَا the
beast gave an indication of a limping, or halting,
or slight lameness, in its hind leg: whence it
appears that this signification may be tropical.

غَاْمَزَ [This verb is mentioned by Golius as syn.
with عايب, a verb for which I find no authority:
and Freytag renders it “ Vitii arguit,” and refers
to a passage in Har (p. 427 of the see. ed.)
where (like as is done by Golius) المُغامِز and
المُعايِب, as syn., are erroneously put for المَغامِز
and المَعايِب.]

أَغْمَزَتْ She (a camel) had fat, (O, K,) or

that for which he should be deemed weak: (A,
TA:) and ↓ اغتمزهُ he impugned his character;

(K.) You say, فُلَانٌ ↓ فَعَلْتُ شَيْئًا فاغْتَمَزَهُ (tropical:)  I did
a thing, and such a one impugned my character,

فِى عَقْلِهِ ↓ فَاغْتَمَزَهَا (tropical:)  He heard from me a saying,

غَامِزٌ [meaning Limping, or halting, &c., and
having a limping, or halting, &c.,] is like ظَالِعٌ:
sometimes used as a possessive noun; and [therefore] one does not say غَامِزَةٌ. (O and TA in art.
ظلع.)
مَغْمَزٌ [should by rule be مَغْمِزٌ: its primary
signification is A place of feeling, to know if an
animal be fat: hence, a place of pressing or
squeezing a limb &c.: and a place of pinching
and pressing a spear, to straighten it]. ―

subtile saying, the spear of which has no place
where it requires to be pinched and pressed to
straiten it, and the rock of which has no rough
place requiring to be beaten, or for the rock of
which there is no beating,] means, (assumed tropical:)  that has no
crookedness: مقرع is an inf. n., or means “ a
place of beating,” and صفاة is “ a rock; ” and
the above-mentioned use of these two words is
borrowed from the phrase قَرَعَ صَفَاتَهُ, meaning
(tropical:)  “ he impugned his character; blamed, or censured, him; or spoke against him. ” (Mgh.) ―
