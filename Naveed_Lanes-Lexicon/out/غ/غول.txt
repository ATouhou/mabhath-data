-A2-  In the
saying in the Kur [xxxvii. 46], لَا فِيهَا غَوْلٌ,

another place, [lvi. 19,] لَا يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا: (S, O,

it there means privation of the intellectual faculties.

desert, assuming various forms, causing them to
wander from the way, and destroying them; (JM,
and TA * on the authority of IAth;) but this the
Prophet denied, saying, لَا غُولَ; by which, however, accord. to some, he did not mean to deny
the existence of the غول, but only the assertion of
the Arabs respecting its assuming various forms
and its being able to cause any one to go astray:
(IAth, JM, * TA:) i. q. سِعْلَاةٌ [q. v.]: or a sort
of سِعْلَاة: (S, O, Msb:) or a male jinnee; the
female being called سِعْلَاة: (Abu-l-Wefee ElAarábee, TA:) pl. [of pauc.] أَغْوَالٌ and [of

his mischief by the mention of God: (TA:) or
anything by reason of which the intellect departs;
as also ↓ غَوْلٌ: (K:) and anything that takes a
