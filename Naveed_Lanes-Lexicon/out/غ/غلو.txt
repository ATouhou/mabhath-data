غلو1
غَلَا, aor. يَغْلُو, primarily signifies He, or it,
exceeded the proper, due, or common, limit; was
excessive, immoderate, or beyond measure; but the
inf. n. differs in different cases, as will be shown
in what follows: (Er-Rághib, TA:) it is said of
anything as meaning it exceeded, or was excessive.
(Msb.) ―
-b2-  You say, غَلَا فِى الأَمْرِ, (S, K,) aor. as
above, (TA,) inf. n. غُلُوٌّ (S, K, TA) and غَلَانِيَةٌ;
as also بِهِ ↓ تغالى; (K * and TA in art. غلى; [but
belonging to the present art., as is said in the
TA;]) He exceeded the proper, due, or common,
limit, in the affair; was excessive, or immoderate,
therein. (S, K, TA.) And غَلَا فِى الدِّينِ, aor.
as above, inf. n. غُلُوٌّ, He acted, or behaved, with
forced hardness, or strictness, or rigour, in religion, so that he exceeded the proper, due, or
common, limit: whence the usage of the verb in
the Kur iv. 169 and v. 81: (Msb, TA:) accord.
to IAth, الغُلُوُّ فِى الدِّينِ is the investigating of the
intrinsic states, or circumstances, of things, [in
religion,] and [applying oneself to] the discovery
of their causes, and of the abstrusities relating to

بِهِ ↓ غالى, (Mgh, K,) and ↓ غالاهُ, (K,) inf. n. غِلَآءٌ
(Mgh, K) and مُغَالَاةٌ; (K;) He shot the arrow
to the furthest distance (S, Mgh, Msb) that he
was able to attain: (S, Mgh:) or he raised his
arms with the arrow, desiring [to attain with it]
the furthest limit. (K, * TA.) And غَلَا السَّهْمُ The
arrow rose in its course, and exceeded the [usual]
limit; (K, TA;) and in like manner, الحَجَرُ the

-b4-  And غَلَا السِّعْرُ, (S, Mgh, Msb,
K, *) aor. as above, (Msb, TA,) inf. n. غَلَآءٌ, (S,
Mgh, K,) or this is a simple subst., (Msb,) The
price, or rate, at which a thing was to be sold,
was, or became, high; (Mgh, Msb, TA;) or
exceeded the usual limit; (Er-Rághib, TA;) contr.
of رَخُصَ. (K.) ―
-b5-  And غَلَا بِهَا عظم [i. e. عِظَمٌ,
lit. Bigness exceeded the usual limit in her;]
meaning she became plump, or fat: (TA:) one
says, غلا بِالجَارِيَةِ عظم, and بِالغُلَامِ, [the girl, or
young woman, became plump, or fat, and the boy,
or young man,] in the case of their quickly attaining to young womanhood and young manhood.
(TA in another part of this art.) ―
-b6-  And غَلَا is
said of anything as meaning اِرْتَفَعَ [i. e. It rose in
degree; as is shown by the following ex.]: Dhur-Rummeh says,
فَمَا زَالَ يَغْلُو حُبُّ مَيَّةَ عِنْدَنَا
وَيَزْدَادُ حَتَّى لَمْ نَجِدْ مَا نَزِيدُهَا
[And the love of Meiyeh ceased not to rise in
degree with us, and to increase, so that we found
not what more we might give to her]. (TA.) ―

by the words إِذَا تَوَاهَقَتْ أَخْفَافُهَا which I have
here rendered accord. to an explanation in art.
وهق in the O: but the phrase مغلاة الوهق is
there mentioned as an ex. of الوَهَق as signifying
“ the lasso; ” whence it appears that the phrase
lit. means that exceeds the limit of the lasso;
agreeably with the explanation of Golius, “rapide
currens, et fugiens laqueum sibi injiciendum: ”])
or [the meaning is a she-camel that steps far in
vying, or keeping pace, with another; for], in
explaining the phrase مِغْلَاةُ الوَهَقِ, IB says that
