MF,) [sec. pers. غَنِنْتَ,] aor. يَغِنُّ, (Msb, K,)
inf. n. غُنَّةٌ (MA, KL) and غَنَنٌ, (MA, [and the
same seems to be indicated in the Msb by its
being said that the verb is of the class of تَعِبَ,])
or غَنٌّ, (TK, [but this I think a mistake,]) He
spoke (MA, Msb, KL) in, (MA,) or from, (Msb,
KL,) or [rather] through, (KL,) his nose, (MA,
KL,) or his خَيَاشِيم [app. here meaning the innermost parts of the air-passages of the nose]. (Msb.)
[The author of the K gives no indication of the
proper signification of this verb but that of its
implying what he states to be meant by غُنَّةٌ,
which see below.] ―

applied to a gazelle (ظَبْىٌ), meaning Whose cry
issues from his خَيَاشِيم [expl. above]: J has erred
in saying that it is applied to طَيْر [i. e. birds, or

applied to them [as meaning making a humming
sound]. (TA.) ―

[the utterance of] which results what is termed
