TA,) into (فِى) a thing; (S, K, TA;) as, for instance, the foot into sand; (S, TA;) and a man
into mud, (TA,) or into water; (Msb;) and into
a valley; (TA, in this art. and in art. غيط; in

(S, TA,) inf. n. غَيْطٌ, (K,) signifies the same: (S,
K:) both also signify he, or it, became hidden,

inf. n. as above, He dug, excavated, or hollowed
out. (TA: and in some copies of the K, الغَوْطُ is
expl. by الحَفْرُ; but the reading given in the TA,
in that instance, is الحُفْرَةُ.)
-A2-  غُطْ غُطْ means Be
thou with the جَمَاعَة [i. e. the mass, or main body],
(IAar, O, K,) who are termed the غَاط, (O,) [be

[i. e. factions, &c.,] come. (IAar, O, K.)
2
غوّط, inf. n. تَغْوِيطٌ, He gobbled [food]:
(Ibn-'Abbád, O, K: *) or gobbled largely, or in
large mouthfuls: (K, * TA:) from غَوْطٌ meaning
ثَرِيد. (TA.)
-A2-  And تَغْوِيطٌ signifies also The

4
أَغْوَطَ He made deep a well. (Fr, O, TA.
[See also 2.])

Msb, K, TA. [In the CK, اَنْدىٰ is put by
mistake for ابدى.])
6
تَغَاوَطَا فِى المَآءِ They two vied, or contended,
each with the other, in plunging, or diving, in the

not in the mass, or main body, of the people, the
like of him]. (O, TA.)
غَوْطٌ A hollow, cavity, pit, or the like, dug, or
excavated, in the ground; syn. حُفْرَةٌ. (So in the
K, accord. to the TA, on the authority of AA:
but in some copies of the K, الغَوْطُ in this instance
is expl. by الحَفْرُ: see 1, last sentence.) See also
غَائِطُ.
-A2-  And i. q. ثَرِيدٌ [Crumbled bread moistened with broth]. (O: in the K ثَرِيدَة.)
غَيْطٌ: see غَائِطٌ, latter half.
غَوْطَةٌ A [low, or depressed, place, or hollow,
such as is called] وَهْدَة, in the ground. (ISh, K.)
[See also غَائِطٌ.]
غُوطَةٌ A place comprising water and herbage:
whence غُوطَةُ دِمَشْقَ, (Har pp. 130, et seq.,) i. e.

a place abounding with water and trees. (S.)
بِئْرٌ غَوِيطَةٌ A deep well. (TA.)
غَائِطٌ A wide, depressed piece of ground or land,
(ISh, S, O, Msb, K,) but not much depressed, and
in some instances having acclivities [bordering it];
(ISh;) sometimes, as they assert, a league (فَرْسَخ)
in extent, and having in it meadows; (AHn;)
and ↓ غَاطٌ and ↓ غَوْطٌ signify the same; (O, K;)
or the last is more depressed than the غائط:
(IDrd, O:) and غائط is also applied to a valley:
(TA:) the pl. [of pauc.] is أَغْوَاطٌ, (S, Msb, K,)
or this is pl. of غَوْطٌ, (IB,) and [of mult.] غِيطَانٌ,
(S, Msb, K,) which is pl. of both these sings.,
(IB,) and غُوطٌ (S, Msb, K) and غِيَاطٌ. (K.) ―
-b2-
Hence, (tropical:)  A place in which one satisfies a want of
nature; the custom being to do so in a depressed
place, where one is concealed. (S, * Msb, * TA.)
In the Kur [iv. 46, or v. 9], accord. to an extraordinary reading, it is written ↓ غَيْط, [a form now
commonly used, and signifying a garden, but
there meaning a privy place,] the original form of
which may be غَيْوِط, and then غَيِّط, [and then
غَيْط,] it being contracted; or, accord. to Abu-l-
Hasan, the ى may be originally و, these two
letters being in this instance interchangeable.
(IJ.) You say, أَتَى الغَائِطَ, (S, TA,) and ضَرَبَ
الغَائِطَ, (TA,) (tropical:)  He satisfied a want of nature;
(S, TA;) voided excrement, or ordure. (TA.)
―
-b3-  And hence, (S, TA,) (tropical:)  Human excrement, or
ordure: (S, K, TA:) because they used to cast
it away in a غائط: or because they used to go
thither to satisfy a want of nature. (TA.)
