غرق1
غَرِقَ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) aor.
غَرَقَ, (Mgh,
Msb,) inf. n. غَرَقٌ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb,) He, or it,
(a thing, Msb,) sank, syn. غَارَ, (Mgh,) or رَسَبَ,
(TA,) فِى المَآءِ [in water, or in the water]: (S,
Mgh, O, Msb:) primarily [he drowned; i. e. he
sank under water, and] the water entered the two
apertures of his nose so that it filled its passages
and he died. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] غَرِقَ فِى البِلَادِ,
inf. n. as above, * He (a man) went downwards
and disappeared (رَسَبَ) in the lands, or tracts of
land. (TA.)
-A2-  غَرَقَ, (thus in the O,) or غَرِقَ,
like فَرِحَ, (thus accord. to the K,) He drank a
[draught such as is termed] غُرْقَة: (O, K:) so says
IAar. (O.) And غَرَقْتُ مِنَ اللَّبَنِ, (O, and thus
in copies of the K, in the CK غَرِقْتُ,) or غَرَقْتُ
مِنَ اللَّبَنِ غُرْقَةً, (TA,) I took a [draught such as
is termed] كُثْبَة of the milk: (O, K, TA:) so
says Ibn-'Abbád. (O, TA.)
-A3-  And غَرِقَ He was,
or became, without want, or need. (IAar, O, K.)
-A4-  غَرْقًا used in the sense of إِغْرَاقًا, see under 4.
2
غَرَّقَ see 4, first sentence. ―
-b2-  Hence تَغْرِيقٌ became used to signify (tropical:)  Any killing: the origin of
its being thus used being the fact that the midwife
used to drown the new-born infant in the fluid of
the secundine in the year of drought, (S, O, K,
TA,) whether it were a male or female, (S, O,
TA,) so that it died: (S, O, K, TA:) or it is
from the phrase غَرَّقَتِ القَابِلَةُ الوَلَدَ meaning (tropical:)  The
midwife was ungentle with the child [at the birth]
so that the [fluid called] سَابِيَآء entered its nose and
killed it: or, accord. to the A, غَرَّقَتِ القَابِلَةُ المَوْلُودَ
means the midwife did not remove from out of the
nose of the new-born infant the mucus, so that it
entered into the air-passages of the nose and killed
it. (TA.) Hence the saying of Dhu-r-Rummeh,
إِذَا غَرَّقَتْ أَرْبَاضُهَا ثِنْىَ بَكْرَةٍ
بِتَيْهَآءَ لَمْ تُصْبِحْ رَؤُومًا سَلُوبُهَا
i. e. When her ropes [with which her saddle is
bound] kill a youthful she-camel's second young
one, [and she casts it in consequence, in a desert
in which one loses his way,] she [who is bereft of
it] does not become one that shows affection for
her offspring, by reason of the fatigue that has
come upon her: (S, O, TA:) for, as is said in
the T, where this verse is cited, when the saddle
is bound on the she-camel that has been ten
months pregnant, sometimes the fœtus becomes
drowned in the fluid of the سَابِيَآء, and she casts
it. (TA.) ―
-b3-  غُرِّقَ, said of a bridle, [and of the
scabbard of a sword, as also ↓ أُغْرِقَ, (see مُغَرَّقٌ,)]
signifies (tropical:)  It was ornamented, or was ornamented
in a general manner, with silver. (TA.) ―
-b4-  See,
again, 4.
-A2-  غرّق البَيْضَةَ He removed the غِرْقِئ
[q. v.] of the egg. (TA.)
3
غَارَقَنِى كَذَا (tropical:)  Such a thing was, or became,
near to me; drew near to me; or approached me.
(TA.) And غَارَقَتْهُ المَنِيَّةُ (tropical:)  [Death became near
to him]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And غَارَقَتِ الوَقْعَةُ (tropical:)  The
onslaught was, or became, obligatory. (TA.)
4
اغرقهُ, (S, O, Msb, K, TA,) inf. n. أِغْرَاقٌ;
(TA;) and ↓ غرّقهُ, (S, Msb, K, TA,) inf. n. تَغْرِيقٌ;
(TA;) [primarily, He drowned him: (see 1, first
sentence:) generally expl. as meaning] he sank
him, or it, (TA, [see again 1, first sentence,])
فِى المَآءِ [in water, or in the water] (S, * O,
Msb, * K, TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] اغرق أَعْمَالَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He
annulled his [good] works, by the commission of
acts of disobedience. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And اغرقهُ النَّاسُ
(assumed tropical:)  The people multiplied against him and overcame
him: and in like manner, أَغْرَقَتْهُ السِّبَاعُ (assumed tropical:)  [The
beasts of prey multiplied against him &c.] so
says IAar. (TA.) ―
-b4-  The saying of Lebeed,
describing a horse.
يُغْرِقُ الثَّعْلَبَ فِى شِرَّتِهِ
is said to mean (assumed tropical:)  He outstrips the ثَعْلَب [i. e. the
fox] in his sprightliness, and leaves him behind:
[see also 8:] or he causes the part of the spearshaft that enters into its iron head to disappear in
him who is pierced therewith by reason of the
vehemence of his running. (O, TA. *) ―
-b5-  اغرق
الكَأْسَ means (tropical:)  He filled the كأس [or wine-cup].
(O, K, TA.) ―
-b6-  See also 2, near the end. ―
-b7-
اغرق فِى القَوْسِ [السَّهْمَ being understood] (tropical:)  He
(the drawer of the bow, i. e., of the string of the
bow with the arrow, S, O, K, TA, or the shooter,
Msb) drew the bow to the fall: (S, O, Msb, K:)
accord. to ISh, الاغراق signifies the sending the
arrow far by vehement drawing [of the bow]:
accord. to Useyd El-Ghanawee, the drawing of
the bow so that it brings the sinews that are
wound upon the socket of the arrow, as far as
the iron head, to the part that is grasped by the
hand; which is termed شُرْبُ القَوْسِ الرِّصَافَ; and
one says of him who does so, يَنْزِعُ حَتَّى يَشْرَبَ
بِالرِّصَافِ: (TA:) ↓ غرّق, also, signifies the same,
(O, K,) inf. n. تَغْرِيقٌ: (O:) and one says, غرّق
النَّبْلَ, meaning he drew the bow with the arrows
to the utmost extent. (TA.) In the saying in the
Kur [lxxix. 1], ↓ وَالنَّازِعَاتِ غَرْقًا, the last word is
put in the place of the proper inf. n. of أَغْرَقَ, for
إِغْرَاقًا; (Fr, * Az, O, K; *) the meaning being
By those angels that pull forth the souls of the
unbelievers from their bosoms with a vehement
pulling. (Fr, O.) ―
-b8-  Hence, i. e. from اغرق السَّهْمَ
[or اغرق فِى القَوْسِ], one says, اغرق فِى القَوْلِ,
(TA,) or فِى الشَّىْءِ, (Msb,) (tropical:)  He exceeded the
usual bounds, degree, or mode; exerted himself
much, beyond measure, or to the utmost; or was
extravagant, or immoderate; (Msb, TA;) in the
saying, (TA,) or in the thing. (Msb.) [See
also 10.]
8
اغترق الخَيْلَ (tropical:)  He (a horse) mixed among
the [other] horses, and then outstripped them, or
outwent them. (S, O, K, TA.) And اغترق حَلْبَةَ
الخَيْلِ (tropical:)  He (a horse) outstripped, or outwent, the
collection of horses started together for a wager
that were preceding. (AO, TA.) And [hence]
one says, خَاصَمَنِى فَاغْتَرَقْتُ حَلْبَتَهُ, meaning
(assumed tropical:)  [He contended with me in an altercation, or he
disputed, or litigated, with me, and] I overcame
him in the altercation, &c. (TA.) ―
-b2-  اغترق
التَّصْدِيرَ, (O, K, TA,) or البَطَانَ, (O, TA,) (tropical:)  He
(a camel), his belly being large, (O, K, TA,) and
his sides being swollen, (O, TA,) took up the whole
of the breast-girth, (O, K, TA,) or the belly-girth,
(O, TA,) so that it was too strait for him; as
also ↓ استغرقهُ. (O, K, TA.) ―
-b3-  And اغترق النَّفَسَ
(assumed tropical:)  He took in the whole of the breath in drawing
it in, or back, with vehemence. (S, O, TA.)
Accord. to the copies of the K, اغترقت الَّفْسُ,
meaning اِسْتَوْعَبَت: but this is a mistake: the
correct phrase is اغترق النَّفَسَ, the latter word
مُحَرَّكَة [and in the accus. case]; and the explanation, اِسْتَوْعَبَهُ فِى الزَّفِيرِ. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And تَغْتَرِقُ
نَظَرَهُمْ, said of a woman, (tropical:)  [She engrosses their
look; i. e.] she occupies them in looking at her so
as to divert them from looking at other than her,
by reason of her beauty: (O, K, TA:) and in like
manner one says, تغترق الطَّرْفَ (tropical:)  [she engrosses the
look]. (O, TA.) [See also what next follows.]
10
استغرق (tropical:)  He, or it, took, took in or comprised or comprehended or included, or took up or
occupied, altogether, wholly, or universally; took
in the gross; engrossed; syn. اِسْتَوْعَبَ. (S, O, K,
TA.) Hence the phrase of the grammarians, لَا
لِاسْتِغْرَاقِ الجِنْسِ (tropical:)  [لا denoting the universal inclusion of the genus]. (TA.) [Hence also several
other conventional usages of the word]. See
also 8 [with which it is interchangeable in several
cases]. ―
-b2-  اِسْتَغْرَقَ فِى الضَّحِكِ is like, (O, TA,) or
syn. with, (K,) اِسْتَغْرَبَ (tropical:)  [He exceeded the usual
bounds, or degree, in laughing; was immoderate
in laughing]. (O, K, TA.) [And in the same
sense the verb is used in other cases. See also 4,
last signification.]
12
اِغْرَوْرَقَتْ عَيْنَاهُ His eyes shed tears (S, O,
K, TA) as though they were drowned therein:
(O, K, TA:) or اِغْرَوْرَقَتْ عَيْنَاهُ بِالدُّمُوعِ his eyes
filled with tears but did not overflow. (ISk, Az,
TA.)
Q. Q. 1
غَرْقَأَتْ, as said of a hen, mentioned in
this art. in the K (as being Q. Q.) and also in the
TA as said of an egg, see in art. غرقأ.
غَرِقٌ and ↓ غَارِقٌ and ↓ غَرِيقٌ part. ns. of غَرِقَ,
(S, O, Msb, K,) the first and second signifying
[Drowning; or] sinking in water without dying;
(S, * Msb;) and the third, [drowned; or] dead by
sinking in water; (Kh, Msb;) i. q. مُغْرَقٌ or مُغَرَّقٌ;
(so in different copies of the S;) and accord. to
the Bari', the third may have both meanings
agreeably with analogy; (Msb;) [see an instance
of its usage in the former sense voce تَغَمْغَمَ; and
the first is sometimes used in the latter sense;
for] it is said in a trad. that the غَرِق is of those
who are [reckoned as] شُهَدَآء [or martyrs: see
شَهِيدٌ]; (O, TA;) though it is said that غَرِقٌ signifies sinking in water [like as does غَارِقٌ]; and
غَرِيقٌ, dead therein; or, accord. to Aboo-'Adnán
غَرِقٌ signifies overcome by the water but not
having yet sunk; and غَرِيقٌ, having sunk [therein]:
(TA:) the pl. of غَرِيقٌ is غَرْقَى. (Mgh, O, Msb,
K. *) ―
-b2-  It is said in a trad., يَأْتِى عَلَى النَّاسِ زَمَانٌ
لَا يَنْجُو فِيهِ أَحَدٌ إِلَّا مَنْ دَعَا دُعَآءَ الغَرِقِ [A time will
come upon men in which no one will become safe
but he who prays with the praying of the drowning]; app. meaning, but he who is sincere in
praying, as is he who is on the brink of destruction. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And مَاتَ غَرِقًا فِى الخَمْرِ, in
another trad., means (tropical:)  He died going to the
utmost point, or degree, in the drinking of wine.
(TA.) ―
-b4-  أَرْضٌ غَرِقَةٌ means Land in the utmost
state of irrigation. (IF, A, O, K.) ―
-b5-  غَرِقٌ and
↓ غَرِيقٌ also signify (tropical:)  A man much [or deeply] in
debt: and overwhelmed by trials. (TA.) ―
-b6-  And
one says, إِنَّهُ لَغَرِقُ الصَّوْتِ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  Verily he is
frightened so that his voice is stopped short. (Ibn-
'Abbád, O, K.)
غُرْقَةٌ A single draught (شَرْبَة [in the CK شُرْبَة])
of milk, &c.: (A 'Obeyd, S, O, K:) or a small
quantity of milk, and of beverage, or peculiarly
of the former: (TA in art. عرق:) pl. غُرَقٌ.
(A 'Obeyd, S, O, K.)
غِرْقِئٌ: see art. غرقأ: its hemzeh is augmentative (O, K) accord. to Fr: (O, TA:) and Aboo-Is-hák [i. e. Zj] held it to be so: (IJ, MF, TA:)
but in the opinion of MF, there is no probable
reason for this, either on the ground of analogy
or of derivation. (TA.)
غَرِيقٌ: see غَرِقٌ, in two places. ―
-b2-  One says
also, أَنَا غَرِيقُ أَيَادِيكَ, meaning (tropical:)  [I am the
drowned in the flood] of thy favours. (TA.)
غِرْيَاقٌ A certain bird: (IDrd, O, K:) so they
assert: but it is not of established authority.
(IDrd, O.)
غَارِقٌ: see غَرِقٌ, first sentence.

ancient Greek word, [a>gariko\n,] (TA,) A certain medicine; a thing [or substance] resembling
أَنْجُذَان; [see حِلْتِيتٌ;] male and female; in the

certain thing [or substance] which originates in
worm-eaten trees; an antidote to poisons, (K,
TA,) an attenuant of turbid humour, exhilarant,
(K, * TA,) and good for sciatica; and [it is said
that] he upon whom it is suspended will not be
stung by a scorpion. (K, TA.)
مُغْرَقٌ: see مُغَرَّقٌ.
مُغْرق, [as though مُغَرِقٌ, but I think it more
probable that it is correctly ↓ مُغَرِّقٌ,] applied to a
she-camel, That casts her young one, in a perfect
state or otherwise, and will not be made to incline
to it, or to affect it, nor will be milked; not such
as yields her milk copiously, nor [such as is termed]
خَلِفَة [q. v.]. (TA.)
