غربلQ. 1
غَرْبَلَهُ, (S, MA, O, K,) inf. n. غَرْبَلَةٌ,
(TA,) He sifted it; (MA;) i. q. نَخَلَهُ; (K;)
namely, flour, &c., (S, O,) or earth, or mould.

copies of the K and in the TA.) ―
-b4-  And غربل
القَوْمَ He slew, and crushed [lit. ground], the
people, or company of men. (K.) Hence the

يُغَرْبَلُ النَّاسُ فِيهِ (O, * TA) i. e. [How will it be
with you when ye shall be in a time when men]
shall be slain, and crushed? (TA:) or the meaning is, when the best of them shall be taken away
and the worst of them shall remain; like as is
done by the sifter of wheat? (O, TA:) or, in the
opinion of Suh, as he says in the R, when they
shall be searched to the utmost, and pursued one
after another? agreeably with the saying of Mek-
hool Ed-Dimashkee, دَخَلْتُ الشَّأْمَ فَغَرْبَلْتُهَا غَرْبَلَةً
حَتَّى لَمْ أَدَعْ عِلْمًا إِلَّا حَوَيْتُهُ [I entered Syria, and
searched it to the utmost in such a manner that I
left not a science but I acquired it]. (TA.) ―

And غُرْبِلَ القَتِيلُ The slain man became swollen,
or inflated, and raised his legs. (TA.)
غَرْبَالٌ [A sieve;] a certain thing well known;
(S, O;) the thing with which one sifts: (K:) pl.
غَرَابِيلُ. (O.) ―
-b2-  And (O, K, TA) hence, as
being likened thereto in respect of its circular
shape, (TA,) A tambourine: (O, K, TA:) whence
the trad., أَعْلِنُوا النِّكَاحَ وَاضْرِبُوا عَلَيْهِ بِالْغِرْبَالِ [Publish ye the marriage, and beat for it the tambourine]. (O, TA.) ―
-b3-  And (tropical:)  One who makes
known what has been told him, in a malicious, or
mischievous, manner, so as to occasion discord, or
dissension. (K, TA.)
غِرْبِيلٌ a word said to signify A sparrow:
occurring in the saying, in a trad. of Ibn-EzZubeyr, أَتَيْتُمُونِى فَاتِحِى أَفْوَاهِكُمْ كَأَنَّكُمُ الغِرْبِيلُ
[Ye came, or have come, to me opening your
mouths as though ye were the sparrow]. (TA.)

-b2-  And hence, app.,] Dispersed,
