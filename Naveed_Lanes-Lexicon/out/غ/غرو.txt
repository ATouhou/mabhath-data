it is said that the trees [app. that produce the
mucilage termed غِرَآء, otherwise [know not what

tall buildings, said to be the tombs of Málik and
Akeel, the two cup-companions of Jedheemeh ElAbrash; thus called because En-Noamán Ibn-El-Mundhir used to smear them (كَانَ يُغَرِّيهِمَا)

omen, the story of which is well known], (S,

أَدْرِكْنِى وَلَوْ بِأَحَدِ المُغْرُوَّيْنِ, meaning [Reach thou
me, though] with one of the two [feathered]
arrows: or, as Th says, with an arrow or with
a spear: (S:) El-Mufaddal says, there were two
brothers, of the people of Hejer, a people to
whom the Arabs ascribe stupidity, and one of
those two rode an intractable she-camel, and the
one that did not ride had with him a how, and
his name was Huneyn; so the one that was
riding called to him, and said, يَا هُنَيْنُ وَيْلَكَ
انْزِلْنِى وَلَوْ بِأَحَدِ المَغْرُوَّيْنِ, [in which انزلنى seems
to be a mistranscription for ادركنى,] meaning,
with his arrow; whereupon his brother shot at
him and laid him prostrate; and his saying
became a prov., applied on an occasion of necessity, or difficulty, and of the after failing of
stratagem. (Meyd.) One says also قَوْسٌ مَغْرُوَّةٌ
[A glued bow] (S, Msb, K) and ↓ مَغْرِيَّةٌ. (S, K.)
