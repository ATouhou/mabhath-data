غَضِنَ and
غَضُنَ, (K,) inf. n. غَضْنٌ,
(S,) He, or it, (a man, and a thing, S,) withheld,
restrained, hindered, or diverted, him. (S, K.)
One says, مَا غَضَنَكَ عَنَّا What withheld, hindered,
or diverted, or has withheld, &c., thee from us?
(S.) In the “ Nawádir ” of IAar, this verb,
which is correctly thus, with ض, is erroneously
with ص. (TA.)
-A2-  غَضَنَتْ بِوَلَدِهَا, and ↓ غَضّنت,
She (a camel) cast her young one, or fœtus, in an
imperfect state, (K, TA.) before the hair had
grown upon it and its make had become [perfectly apparent. (TA. [See also خَدَجَتْ.])
[This is what is meant in the S where, after the
mention of a signification of ↓ التَّغْضِين which
will be found below, it is said that this word signifies also الرِّجَاعُ (??) رَجَعَتْ, q. v.):
hence, app., (though referring to the K as his
authority,) Freytag has given to غضّنت, as said
of a she-camel, besides the signification mentioned
above, another, which is also assigned to رَجَعَتْ;
(??) she falsely indicated her bring pregnant, by
raising (??) &c.]

↓ غَضِنَ, inf. n. غَضَنٌ [and app. غُضُونٌ, like قُبُولٌ
as an inf. n. of قَبِلَ. though this requires consideration, as will be shown by what follows].
said of the face as having this signification, or
as signifying it was, or became, wrinkled and
speckled; (MA;) [and so, perhaps, ↓ غضّن, for]
التغضين [if not a mistranscription for التَّغَضُّنُ],
as also ↓ الغُضُونُ, is syn. with التَّشَنُّجُ; and one
says فِى جَبْهَتِهِ ↓ رَجُلٌ ذُو غُضُونٍ meaning تَكَسُّرٍ
[i. e. a man having a wrinkling in his forehead;
but غُضُون may be here used as pl. of غَضْنٌ, and
thus meaning wrinkles]: and ↓ غَضَنٌ signifies a
bending (تَثَنٍّ and تَلَوٍّ) of a branch or twig or the
like. (TA.) One says also, تَغَضَّنَتِ الدِّرْعُ عَلَى

mail, (S, K,) &c. (S:) pl. غُضُونٌ, S Mgh, Msb,
K,) occurring in a verse cited in art. شأب (TA.)

event]; like فِى أَثْنَآءِ كذا (TA in art. ثنى ―

غضو and غضى
1
غَضَا, aor. يَغْضُو; and غَضَى, aor. يَغْضَى: see
4; the former, in three places.
-A2-  غَضَا, (K, TA,
aor. يَغْضُو, thus in the M, (TA,) inf. n. غُضُوٌّ.
(K, * TK,) He, i. e. a man, [and app. it. i. e. a
thing,] was, or became, such as is termed غَاضٍ
[q. v.]. (K, TA. [In the TK it is mentioned
only as said of a thing but the context in the K
indicates that it is said of a man, and app. of a
thing also.])
-A3-  [See also غُضُوٌّ below]
-A4-  غَضِيَتِ
الإِبِلُ, inf. n. غَضًا, The camels had a complaint
(M, K, TA) of their bellies (K, TA) from eating
of the trees called غَضًا. (M, K, TA.) ―
-b2-  And

called غَضًا. (IKtt, TA.)
4
اغضى, (K,) inf. n. إِغْضَآءٌ, (S,) He contracted
his eyelids; drew them near together; (S, K;)
like غَضَّ; (TA in art. غض;) [and] so اغضى
عَيْنَهُ; said of a man: (Msb:) or he closed his
eyelids upon his iris; so in the M; as also ↓ غَضَا,
a dial. var. of اغضى, likewise mentioned by ISd;
and ↓ غَضَى, aor. يَغْضَى, is also a dial. var. thereof:
(TA:) or he made one of his eyelids to cleave to
the other, that he might not see a thing, by reason
of shame: (Har p. 19:) or he put one of his eyelids upon the other from dislike of a thing. (Id.
p. 492.) [See also 6.] ―
-b2-  Hence it is used in
relation to forbearance: so that one says, أَغْضَى
عَلَى القَذَى He held, or refrained, notwithstanding annoyance, spontaneously, without being asked,
or without constraint: (Msb, TA:) or اغضى عَلَى
قَذًى he bore annoyance patiently. (M, TA.) And
اغضى عَنْهُ He feigned himself neglectful of it; [he
closed his eyes from it;] he connived at it; as
also اغمض عنه. (TA in art. غمض.) And [sometimes] الإِغْضَآءُ means The abstaining from proceeding to extremities. (Mgh in art. جوز.) ―
-b3-
Hence also, اغضى عَلَى الشَّىْءِ He was silent respecting the thing; and so ↓ غَضَا, aor. يَغْضُو. (K,
TA.) ―
-b4-  And اغضى عَنْهُ طَرْفَهُ means He closed,
or turned away, from him, or it, his eye, or eyes;

also غُضُوٌّ.])
6
تغاضى He contracted, or put together, his
eyelids, that he might not see an evil, or unseemly,
thing. (Har p. 473. [See also 4.]) ―
-b2-  And
[hence,] تغاضى عَنْهُ i. q. تَغَافَلَ [i. e. He was, or
he feigned himself, unmindful, &c., of him, or it]:
(K, TA:) like تَغَابَى عنه: mentioned by Az.
(TA. [See, again, 4.])
غَضًا, said by Th to be written [thus] with ا
but ISd says, I know not why this is; (TA;)
[the latter, it seems, holding its last letter to be
originally ى, not و;] A species of trees, (S, Msb,
K,) well known, (K,) the wood of which is of the
hardest of wood, and therefore there is hardness
in its charcoal; (Msb;) it is of the plants of the
sands, and has [sprigs, or foliage, of the kind
termed] هَدَب [q. v.], like that called أَرْطًى;
(TA;) and its fire is of long continuance: (Har
p. 60:) [see also رِمْثٌ: Mr. Palgrave (in his
Travels, i. 38,) describes it as a shrub believed
by him to be peculiar to the Arabian Peninsula,
“ of the genus Euphorbia, with a woody stem,
often five or six feet in height, and innumerable
round green twigs, very slender and flexible, forming a large feathery tuft, not ungraceful to the
eye, while it affords some kind of shelter to the
traveller, and food to his camels: ”] the sing. [or
rather n. un.] is غَضَاةٌ: (K:) and AHn says that
sometimes غَضَاتٌ is a pl. [of the n. un.]. (TA.)
―
-b2-  Hence, ذِئْبُ غَضًا [A wolf of trees, or shrubs,
called غَضًا]; (S, K;) or, as in the handwriting
of Aboo-Zekereeyà ذِئْبُ الغَضَا; and such is the
most abominable, or malignant, or noxious, of
wolves; for he comes not into close proximity to
men save when he desires to attack: or this
means the wolf of the covert of trees: for ―
-b3-  غَضًا
signifies also A covert of trees: (TA:) and a
غَيْضَة [i. e. thicket; or collection of tangled, or
confused, or dense, trees; &c.]. (K, TA.) ―
-b4-
أَهْلُ الغَضَا is an appellation of the people of Nejd,
(K, TA,) because of the abundance of [the trees
called] غضا there. (TA.)
بَعِيرٌ غَضٍ A camel having a complaint of his
belly from eating of the trees called غَضًا: and
إِبِلٌ غَضِيَةٌ and غَضَايَا [camels having such a complaint]; (S, K;) like رَمِثَةٌ and رَمَاثَى. (S.)
غَضْيَا: see غَضْيَآءُ. ―
-b2-  Also, (K, TA,) determinate, and imperfectly decl., like [its syn.] هُنَيْدَةُ,
(TA,) A hundred camels: (IAar, K, TA:) held
by ISk to be so called as being likened to a place
producing [an abundance of] غَضًا [i. e. the trees
thus called]: AA has mentioned it with the
article ال, saying that الغَضْيَا signifies a hundred.
(TA.)
غَضْيَآءُ A land (أَرْضٌ) abounding with the trees
called غَضًا. (S, K.) ―
-b2-  And, as also ↓ غَضْيَا, A

غَضًا; (K, TA;) a place where they grow. (TA.)
―
-b3-  And the former, Rugged land or ground.
(TA.)
غُضُوٌّ Intense darkness of the night. (IKtt, TA.
[Perhaps in this sense an inf. n. of which the
verb is غَضَا: see 4, last sentence.]) ―
-b2-  And The
eating of the trees called غَضًا. (IKtt, TA. [App.
in this sense an inf. n. of which the verb is غَضَا.])
-A2-  And A state of muchness, abundance, copiousness, fulness, or completeness, or a thing. (K. [See
also 1, second sentence.])
رَجُلٌ غَضِىٌّ عَنِ الخَنَا or عَنِ الفَحْشَآءِ [A man
who refrains from taking notice of that which is
foul, abominable, unseemly, or obscene,] may be
from غَضَا; or it may be from أَغْضَى, similar to
أَلِيمٌ and وَجِيعٌ; but the former derivation is the
better. (TA.)

called], and applied to a camel [app. as meaning
That is fond of, or wont to feed upon, the trees
called غَضًا]. (S.)
غَضْيَانَةٌ A herd of camels of generous race: (K,
TA:) mentioned by Az, from AA. (TA.)
غَاضٍ Dark; applied to night (لَيْل); as also
↓ مُغْضٍ, but this latter is rare: (S, Msb:) and so
غَاضِيَةٌ, (S, K,) applied to a night (لَيْلَة): (S:) or,
thus applied, accord. to Az, intensely dark. (TA.)
―
-b2-  And غَاضِيَةٌ signifies also Bright, or shining
brightly; (S, K;) applied to a night, (thus in
one of my copies of the S,) or to fire (نَار): (so
in other copies of the S and in the TA:) thus
having two contr. meanings. (S, K.) ―
