after his knowledge, love, or desire, has urged to

and who has turned: or has turned, in ignorance,
from that which was right, and who has suffered
himself to be turned; for,] accord. to Az, غَوَاهُ
الهَوَى is most correctly rendered as meaning لَوَاهُ,
and صَرَفَهُ; and انغوى is quasi-pass. thereof.

as from Iblees, فَبِمَا أَغْوَيْتَنِى means [Then by, or
because of,] thy having caused me to err: or, as
some say, invited me to [do] a thing whereby I
have erred. (TA.) But the saying in the same
[xi. 36], إِنْ كَانَ اللّٰهُ يُرِيدُ أَنْ يُغْوِيَكُمْ is said to
mean If God desire to punish you for erring: or
to decree, against you, your erring [i. e. that ye
shall err]. (TA.)

(S, TA;) originally, (TA,) in an evil affair; from
الغَىّ and الغَوَايَة: (S, TA:) or they aided one
another against him, and slew him; (K;) but
this addition “ and slew him ” is from a trad.
respecting the slaying of 'Othmán, in which it is
said, فَتَغَاوَوْا عَلَيْهِ وَاللّٰهِ حَتَّى قَتَلُوهُ [and they collected themselves together, &c., against him, by
God, so that they slew him]: (TA:) or they
came against him from this quarter and from
that; though they did not slay him: (ISd, K,
TA:) or they collected themselves together, and
aided one another, against him, as do those who

the same sense, agreeably with a saying in the
JK, المُنْغَوِى شِبْهُ المُنْهَوِى المَائِلُ]: (K:) [or
rather,] accord. to Az, [it signifies he was, or
became, or suffered himself to be, made to decline,
or to turn, from the right way or course, by love,
or desire; for he says that] it is quasi-pass. of
غَوَاهُ الهَوَى, which signifies أَمَالَهُ and صَرَفَهُ: (TA:)
or he fell into error by yielding to love and desire.

because it is the consequence of غَىّ [properly thus
termed]: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or it there means
