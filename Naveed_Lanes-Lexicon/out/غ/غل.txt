i. e. [There are three habits, (خِصَال being understood, these, as is said in the O, being “ the acting sincerely towards God,” and “ giving honest
counsel to those in command,” and “ keeping to
the community ” of the Muslims,)] while conforming to which the heart of the believer will not be
invaded by rancour, malevolence, malice, or spite,
causing it to swerve from that which is right; (S, *
O;) a saying of the Prophet; thus related by
some: accord. to others, ↓ يُغِلُّ, (S, O,) with

expl. in the next sentence here following. (S, * O.)

thus the latter, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) accord. to
ISk (S, Msb) and A'Obeyd, (S,) in a general
sense; (Mgh, Msb;) and he became unfaithful:
(TA:) but the former verb is used only in relation to spoil, or booty; (S, Mgh, O, * Msb, K;)
you say, غَلَّ مِنَ المَغْنَمِ meaning خَانَ [i. e. He
acted unfaithfully in taking from the spoil, or
booty]; (S, O;) or meaning he acted unfaithfully
in relation to the spoil, or booty: (Mgh:) or غَلَّ,
(IAth, Mgh, TA,) aor. as above, (Mgh,) inf. n.
غُلُولٌ, (IAth, TA,) or غَلٌّ, (Mgh, [thus in my
copy, accord. to which it is trans., as will be
shown by what follows,]) signifies also he stole;
and was unfaithful in respect of a thing privily;
and such conduct is termed غُلُولٌ because, in the
case thereof, the hands, or arms, have the غُلّ
[q. v.] put upon them: (IAth, TA:) or it signifies also he took a thing and hid it amid his
goods; and it occurs in a trad. as meaning he
took a شَمْلَة privily. (Mgh.) It is said in the
Kur [iii. 155], وَمَا كَانَ لِنَبِىٍّ أَنْ يَغُلَّ and أَنْ
↓ يُغَلَّ, accord. to different readers; the former
meaning [And it is not attributable to a prophet]
that he would act unfaithfully; and ↓ ان يُغَلَّ
meaning, [agreeably with an explanation of أَغَلَّ
فُلَانًا in the K,] that unfaithful conduct should be
imputed to him; or that there should be taken
from his [share of the] spoil, or booty; (S, O,
TA;) [or this may mean, that he should be found
to be acting unfaithfully; for, accord. to the TA,
اغلّ الرَّجُلَ means وَجَدَهُ غَالًّا;] but IB says that a
pass. aor. is seldom found in the language of the
Arabs in a phrase of this kind. (TA.) And it is
said in a trad. وَلَا إِسْلَالَ ↓ لَا إِغْلَالَ i. e. There shall
be no acting unfaithfully nor stealing: or there shall
be no act of bribery [nor stealing]: (S, O:) or,
as some say, there shall be no aiding another to
act unfaithfully [&c.]. (TA.)

(K,) or daubed, or smeared, his beard, much, (O,)
the teshdeed denoting muchness, (S, O,) with غَالِيَة:

↓ تَغَلْغَلَ He perfumed himself with غالية: (K:)
Lh mentions تَغَلَّى بِالغَالِيَةِ, which is either from
the word غَالِيَة or originally تَغَلَّلَ, in the latter
case being like تَظَنَّيْتُ for تَظَنَّنْتُ, but the former
is the more agreeable with analogy: accord. to
Fr, one says, بالغالية ↓ تَغَلَّلْتُ, and not تَغَلَّيْتُ:
(TA:) As held ↓ تَغَلَّلْتُ from الغالية to be allowable if meaning I introduced the غالية into my
beard or my mustache; (S, O;) and the like is
the case with respect to غَلَّلْتُ بِهَا لِحْيَتِى: (S:)
accord. to Lth, one says, from الغالية, غَلَّلْتُ and
غَلَّفْتُ and غَلَّيْتُ. (TA. [See also 1 in art. غلف;
and see art. غلى.])

thirst: (O, TA:) thus expl. by Az, who says

the authority of AZ, [in this sense,] with the unpointed ع. (TA. [But see 4 in art. عل.]) ―
-b2-

the flesh, or of the flesh and of the fat,] remaining
in the hide on the occasion of the skinning: a dial.
var. of أَغَلَّ. (TA.) ―
