غَسَّاقٌ: see غَسَاقٌ: ―
-b2-  and see also the paragraph
here following, near the end.
الغَاسِقُ signifies The night; (Zj, TA;) and
[hence] وَمِنْ شَرِّ غَاسِقٍ إِذَا وَقَبَ (in the Kur [cxiii.
3], S, O) means [And from the mischief] of the
night when it cometh in; (S, O, K;) accord. to
El-Hasan (S, O) El-Basree: (O:) or the beginning of the night; as El-Hasan is related to have
said: (TA:) or the night when the شَفَق [or redness in the horizon after sunset] disappears: (S,
O, K:) and the night is said to be so called
because it is colder than the day: (O, TA:) [for]
الغَاسِقُ signifies [also] the cold (البَارِدُ) [like
الغَسَاقُ] (TA:) or what is meant in the verse of
the Kur-án cited above is the accident in the night:
(Er-Rághib, TA:) or الغَاسِقُ signifies the moon;
(K;) and this is said to be meant in the verse of
the Kur-án; (S, TA;) so the Prophet is related to
have said to Áïsheh; i. e. the verse means, [the
mischief of] the moon when it is eclipsed: (Th,
O, * TA:) or what is meant in that verse is, الثُّرَيَّا
[i. e. the asterism called the Pleiades] when it sets
[aurorally (see ثُرَيَّا)], because diseases and pestilences are frequent at that period. (O, K, TA,)
and become removed at that period of its [auroral]
rising [in the opposite season of the year], (O,
TA,) as is related in a trad. (TA:) or the sun
when it sets: or the day when it enters upon the
night. or the serpent called الأَسْوَد when it smites,
or turns over: or, accord. to Sub. Iblees when he
suggests evil: (TA:) or, accord. to I'Ab and
several others, from the mischief of the ذَكَر when
it becomes erect; (K, TA:) a strange explanation:
and ↓ الغَسَّاقُ is like الغَاسِقُ; [but in what sense
or senses is not said;] each is an epithet in which
the quality of a subst. is predominant. (TA.) ―
-b2-
غَاسِقٌ also signifies Flowing; applied by a poet
in this sense to a source, or spring; and having
to relation to darkness. (Sh. TA.)
