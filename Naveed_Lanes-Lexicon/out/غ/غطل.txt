becoming overcast] concealed the light of the sun
[in this our day]: (JK:) or its دَجْن [or shade

Q. Q. 1
غَطْيَلَ, (O, K, TA,) with the ط before
the ى, (K, * TA,) He was, or became, abundant
in his property, or cattle, and his dependents, or
relations and household, or servants, (O, K, TA,)
and his weal. (O, TA.)
-A2-  And غَيْطَلَ, (O, TA,)
thus correctly in the following senses, accord. to
the K غَطْيَلَ, but this is a mistake, (TA,) He
made his traffic to be in beasts of the bovine kind,
bulls or cows, (O, K, TA,) which are termed
غَيْطَلٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And غَيْطَلَ القَوْمُ فِى الحَدِيثِ
The people, or party, pushed on, pressed on, or
were copious or profuse, in discourse; or entered
into it; and their voices became high: (K, * TA:)
on the authority of El-Hejeree. (TA.) [Accord.
to the K غَطْيَلَ, which is said in the TA to be a
mistake.]
Q. Q. 4
اِغْطَأَلَّ It became heaped up, or it
mounted, one part upon another: (A 'Obeyd, O,
K, TA:) and so اِغْظَأَلَّ, mentioned by IKtt:
(TA:) the former verb occurs in a verse of
Hassán Ibn-Thábit, said of the sea. (O, TA.)
―
-b2-  And, said of the heat, It rose, or became
raised. (R, TA.)
غَيْطَلٌ is pl. of ↓ غَيْطَلَةٌ, [or rather a coll. gen. n.
of which the latter is the n. un.,] signifying
Numerous dense or tangled trees: (S, O:) or the
latter word signifies thus: (K:) or it (the latter)
signifies also dense, or tangled, trees: (S, O:) or
both signify thus: and also anything confused, or
mixed: (Ham p. 213:) or the latter has this last
meaning: and signifies also a collection of trees
and of herbs; (AHn, TA;) and a collection of
[the common tamarisks, called] طَرْفَآء; (K, TA;)
as AHn says on one occasion. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And
[the former, or perhaps both words,] The light of
the dawn when mingling with the darkness of the
night. (Ham p. 213 [q. v.].) ―
-b3-  And غَيْطَلُ
الضُّحَى signifies حَيْثُ تَكُونُ الشَّمْسُ مِنْ مَشْرِقِهَا
كَهَيْئَتِهَا مِنْ مَغْرِبِهَا وَقْتَ الظُّهْرِ, (JK, O, and so
in copies of the K,) or بَعْدَ الظُّهْرِ, (accord. to the
text of the K in the TA,) or وَقْتَ العَصْرِ: (so in
some copies of the K, as mentioned in the TK:)
[the last is evidently the right reading; and the
meaning, The period of the earlier part of the
forenoon, after sunrise, when the sun is distant
from its place of rising like as it is from its place
of setting at the time of the عَصْر (q. v.): الظهر is
probably an old mistranscription.]
-A2-  Also Beasts
of the bovine kind, bulls or cows. (TA.) [See also
غَيْطَلَةٌ, last explanation.] ―
-b2-  And The cat: (K,
TA:) as also خَيْطَلٌ: on the authority of Kr.
(TA.)
غَيْطَلَةٌ: see غَيْطَلٌ. ―
-b2-  Also A company, or
collection, (Th, K, TA,) of men: (K, TA:) or
the assembling of men, and their becoming in a
dense, or confused, state. (IAar, TA.) ―
-b3-  And
Darkness; as also ↓ غَيْطُولٌ; (K;) or the latter
signifies confusedness of darkness; (IDrd, O;) or
signifies also dense (lit. accumulated) darkness.
(K. [The Arabs describe thick darkness as
“ darknesses one above another: ” see Kur xxiv.
40.]) And The intricate and confused blackness
of night: (S, O, K:) or غَيْطَلَةُ اللَّيْلِ signifies the
confusedness and denseness of the darkness [of
night]: and the pl. is غَيَاطِلُ. (TA.) ―
-b4-  Also
A confusion, or mixture, of cries or shouts or
noises; (S, * O, * K;) and so ↓ غَيْطُولٌ: (IDrd,
O, K:) غَيْطَلَاتٌ, pl. of the former, signifies clamours of men: and the sing., the numerous cries
or shouts or noises, and the dust, of war, or battle.
(TA.) ―
-b5-  And The overpowering influence of
drowsiness: (O, K:) [or so غَيْطَلَةُ نُعَاسٍ: pl.
غَيَاطِلُ:] one says, رَيَّثَتْهُ غَيَاطِلُ النُّعَاسِ meaning
غَوَالِبُهُ [i. e. The overpowering influences of drowsiness retarded him, or made him late]. (A, TA.)
―
-b6-  And The means of happiness of the present
world or state of existence: (K:) or غَيَاطِلُ الدُّنْيَا
means those means of happiness: (O:) or this
latter phrase means the consecutive means of happiness of the present world. (TA.) And The
eating and drinking and rejoicing, with security.
(Fr, O, K.) ―
-b7-  And الغَيْطَلَةُ (accord. to Fr, as is
said in the O and TA,) signifies المَالُ المُطْغِى
[as though most probably meaning Property that
causes extravagance]: (O, K, TA:) [but from
what SM remarks respecting it, I can only infer
that he holds المُطْغِى to be an epithet applied to
the cow as signifying “ having a youngling,”
which is termed طَغْيَا or طُغْيَا, (like المُعْجِلُ signifying “ having a calf,” which is termed عِجْلٌ,
and several other epithets of the same form,) and
in like manner applied to a collective number of
cows, though I do not find it mentioned in this
sense; i. e., that he understands; and would
explain, المَالُ المُطْغِى as signifying The cattle,
meaning cows, having younglings: but his derivation of it seems to be far-fetched; and perhaps
he may have been led to assign this meaning to
it by another explanation of غَيْطَلَةٌ with which it
is agreeable, and which will be found in the next
sentence:] it is not [he says] from طَغَا, aor. يَطْغُو,
signifying أَسْرَفَ فِى الظُّلْمِ, as it seems to be at
first sight; but from طَغَتْ said of the بَقَرَة وَحْشِيَّة,
signifying صَاحَتْ, the like of which is also said
of the ثَوْر. (TA.) ―
-b8-  غَيْطَلَةٌ signifies also Such
as has milk, of gazelles, or antelopes, and of beasts
of the bovine kind [perhaps meaning of the wild
species, i. e. bovine antelopes]; (S, O, K;) pl.
غَيَاطِلُ: (S, O:) accord. to AO, the بَقَرَة وَحْشِيَّة
[or bovine antelope]: (S, O:) Th says that it signifies the بَقَرَة [or beast of the bovine kind, bull or
cow], not particularizing the wild species. (TA.)
[See also غَيْطَلٌ, last explanation but one.]
غَيْطُولٌ: see غَيْطَلَةٌ, first quarter, in two places.
غُوطَالَةٌ i. q. رَوْضَةٌ [generally meaning A meadow].
(IAar, O, K.)
شَجَرٌ مُغْطَئِلٌّ Dense, or tangled, trees. (JK.
[See also غَيْطَلٌ.]) And غُصُونٌ Soft, or
tender, branches, (O, TA,) having dense leaves.
(TA.)
