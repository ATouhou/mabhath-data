it seems to be implied in the K that the verb
with ضِرَاحٌ for its inf. n. has its aor., as well as
this inf. n., like that of كَتَبَ, which I do not
think to be the case,] The beast kicked with its
hind leg: (S, O, K:) or الضَّرْحُ is with the fore
legs; and الرَّمْحُ, with the hind legs. (TA.) One

ground; (see ضَرِيحٌ;) and] he split, slit, or rent
asunder or open, anything; like ضَرَجَ, with ج:
(TA:) but the phrase ضَرَحْنَا البُرُودَ, in a verse of
Dhur-r-Rummeh, as some relate it, is expl. by
AA as meaning We threw off the [garments called]
برود: others relate it with ج; and in this case
he says that it means “ we rent asunder ” or
“ open. ” (Az, O, TA.)
-A2-  ضَرَحَ [as though quasipass. of ضَرَحَهُ] signifies also He, or it, was, or

(so accord. to two copies of the S,) or ↓ اضْرَحْهُ,
(so in one of my copies of the S, [i. e. اِضْرَحْهُ,
from ضَرَحَهُ, in my other copy of the S اضْرحْهُ,
so that the correct form of the verb in this sense
is doubtful,]) meaning أَبْعِدْهُ [i. e. Remove thou,
or put far away, him, or it, from thee]. (S.)
[In the TA, it is also expl. as meaning دَفَعَ,

vulgar say اِطَّرَحُوا, thinking it to be from الطَّرْحُ,
whereas it is from الضَّرْحُ: or, accord. to Az, it
may be that, in اطّرحوا, the ت of the measure
اِفْتَعَلَ is changed into ط, and ض incorporated
into it. (L, TA.)
