not draw yourselves together, (K, TA,) and straiten
one another; one saying to another “ Show me
Him,” like as people do in looking at the new
moon, but each will by himself have the sight of
Him: (TA:) or, as some say, it is ↓ لَا تَضَارُّونَ

is the same in signification as لَا تُضَامُّونَ], i. e.
