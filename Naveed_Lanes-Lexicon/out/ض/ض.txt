ضalphabetical letter
ض
The fifteenth letter of the alphabet: called ضَادٌ: it
is one of the letters termed مَجْهُورَة [or vocal, i. e.
pronounced with the voice, and not with the
breath only]; (TA;) and of the letters termed
شَجْرِيَّة, ('Eyn, Mgh, TA,) from الشَّجْرُ, which is
the place of the opening of the mouth: ('Eyn,
Mgh, TA on the letter ج:) its place of utterance
is from the extremity of the tongue [extended so
as to reach] to the part next to the [lateral teeth
called] أَضْرَاس; and it is more usually pronounced
from the left side than from the right: the vulgar
[sometimes] pronounce it as ظَآء, making its place
of utterance to be between the extremity of the
tongue and the central incisors, which pronunciation is peculiar to a dialect, as mentioned by
Fr on the authority of El-Fadl: he says [also]
that some of the Arabs substitute it for ظَآء, saying
ضَهْر for ظَهْر; but that the doing thus, though allowable in speech, is not allowable in the reciting of the
Book of God, which follows the rule, or usage, of
the Prophet: (Msb in art. ضود:) or its place of
utterance is from the foremost part of the edge of
the tongue and the part next to the اضراس; and it
has no sister [or analogue] accord. to Sb; but
accord. to the 'Eyn, it is a sister of ذ and ث, and
these three letters are termed لِثَوِيَّة [or gingival],
because proceeding from the gum; the substitution
of any of these, however, for another of them,
vitiates prayers: (Mgh:) it is of the class termed
الحُرُوفُ المُسْتَعْلِيَةُ: (L in art. ضود:) and is a letter
peculiar to the Arabs, (L and K in that art.,)
accord. to the general and correct opinion; (TA
in that art.;) [whence the saying of Mohammad,
أَنَا أَفْصَحُ مَنْ نَطَقَ بِالضَّادِ I am the most chaste in
speech of those who have pronounced the letter dád;
i. e., of the Arabs, agreeably with another saying,
ascribed to him, mentioned voce بَيْدَ;] or it is
a letter rarely occurring in the language of
any other people. (L in that art.) ―
-b2-  It is always
a radical letter; and is [said to be] not substituted
for another letter; (L in art. ضود;) [but it is so
substituted in some cases of إِدْغَام, as, for instance,
for the ل of the article ال, and in يَضَّرَّعُ for
يَتَضَرَّعُ, and the like; and] it is sometimes substituted for ص, as in مَضَّ الرُّمَّانَةَ for مَصَّهَا, as
Ibn-Osfoor says, and Ks mentions مَنَاضٌ for
مَنَاصٌ; (TA;) and also for ل, as Ibn-Málik says
in the Tes-heel, an instance of which is رَجُلٌ جَضْدٌ
for جَلْدٌ, mentioned by J; (MF, TA;) and
sometimes it is changed into ل, as in the instance
of اِلْطَجَعَ for اِضْطَجَعَ. (S and L &c. in art. ضجع.)
-A2-  [As a numeral, it denotes Eight hundred.]
