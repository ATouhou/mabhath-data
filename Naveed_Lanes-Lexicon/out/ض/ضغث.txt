(O, Msb:) or a dream of which the interpretation
will not prove true, because of its confusedness:

being used to give emphasis to the meaning of
unreality, or because the phrase comprehends
various things: (Bd in xii. 44:) or أَضْغَاثُ الرُّؤْيَا
means the terrors, or frightful things, of the dream.
(Mujáhid, O, TA.) One says also, أَتَانَا بِأَضْغَاثٍ

this is a mistake, and that the word is correctly
written with ب [i. e. ضَاغِبٌ]; but IF and IM
and others write it as in the S. (TA.)
تَضْغِيثٌ Rain that moistens the earth and the
herbage. (K.)
