ضُوَعٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and ضِوَعٌ (AHeyth, O,
K) A certain night-bird, (S, O, Msb, K,) [a
species of owl, i. e.,] of the kind termed هَام: (S,
O, Msb:) or [a male owl;] the male of the بُوم;
(S, O, Msb, K;) accord. to El-Mufaddal: (S,
O:) said by ADk to be a bird that utters a
scream when it perceives the daybreak: (O:) or
the كَرَوَان [a name now given to the stonecurlew, or charadrius œdicnemus]: (K:) or a
certain black bird, resembling the غُرَاب [or crow],
(Et-Táïfee, O, K,) smaller than this, but red in
its wings, these being of a roseate colour: so says
AHát, on the authority of Et-Táïfee: accord. to
others, he says, it is a small bird, less than the
دُخَّل and the حُمَّر; (O;) and in like manner
says Th: (TA:) also that the ↓ ضُوَعَة [which
may be the fem. or a n. un.] is of a colour inclining to yellow, dusky and blackish externally,
and yellow and ash-coloured within, short in the
neck and tail, smaller than the sparrow; and
that it is thus called because of the cry that it
utters at the commencement of daybreak: accord.
to El-Hanashee, the ضُوَع is a bird such as is
termed أَبْغَث [q. v.], resembling the domestic hen,
(O,) the flesh of which is good: (O, K:) but he
adds that it has been said by some to be not a
bird: and in another place of the book he says
that the ↓ ضُوَعَة is black, like the غُرَاب, a little
larger than the ضُجْرَة, red in the خَوَافِق: (O:
[but الخَوَافِق is an obvious mistranscription for
الخَوَافِى: see خَافِيَةٌ:)] the pl. is أَضْوَاعٌ [a pl. of
pauc.] and ضِيعَانٌ. (S, O, Msb, K.)
ضُوَعَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in
two places.
ضُوَاعٌ The cry of the bird called ضُوَع. (S, O,
Msb, K.)
ضَوَائِعُ, applied to camels, (O, K,) and to other
beasts, (O,) Lean, and lank in the belly: (O,
K:) or emaciated: (TA:) app. from ضَاعَ said
of journeying, meaning “ it rendered lean, or
emaciated: (O:) by rule it should be ضَائِعَةٌ.
(TA.)

written الضُوَاعُ,] The fox. (Ibn-'Abbád, K.)
مَضُوعٌ pass. part. n. of ضَاعَهُ. (O, TA.)
