TA: [in the CK, كالضَّرَى is erroneously put
for كَالضَّرِىِّ:]) the latter word is like غَنِىٌّ:
(TA:) the fem. of the former is with ة: and the
pl. [of pauc.] أَضْرٍ [originally أَضْرُوٌ] and [of
mult.] ضِرَآءٌ. (S, M.)

in which it is said of Aboo-Bekr, أَكَلَ مَعَ رَجُلٍ
بِهِ ضِرْوٌ مِنْ جُذَامٍ [He ate with a man in whom
was a taint of elephantiasis]: it is from [the inf. n.]
الضَّرَاوَةُ; as though the disease became attached,
or habituated, to the person: (M, TA:) mentioned by Hr in the “ Ghareebeyn: ” (M:) or,
as some relate it, the word is with the fet-h, [i. e.
↓ ضَرْوٌ,] and is from ضَرَا said of a wound, the

species of tree, of sweet odour, with [the wood of]

(M:) AHn says also, it is of the trees of the
mountains, and is like the great oak, (M, TA, *)
having clusters [of berries] like those of the oak,
but its berries are larger; its leaves are cooked,
and, when thoroughly cooked, are cleared away,
and the water thereof is returned to the fire, and
coagulates, (M, TA,) becoming like قُبَيْطَآء [q. v.],
(M,) and is used medicinally as a remedy for
roughness of the chest and for pain of the fauces:
(M, TA:) or the gum of a certain tree called the
كَمْكَام [i. e. the cancamum-tree], brought from
El-Yemen: (S:) or this is a mistake, for it is
the tree so called, not its gum: (K:) [but] it is
said in the T, on the authority of AHn, that
كَمْكَام signifies the bark (قِرْف) of the tree called
ضِرْو: and some say that it is the resin (عِلْك) of
the ضِرْو: and in the Moheet of Ibn-'Abbád it is
said that كَمْكَام signifies the bark (قِرْف, or, as
some say, لِحَآء,) of the tree called ضِرْو, and is an
aromatic perfume: (TA:) and (K, TA) IAar
says, (TA,) the ضِرْو is the حَبَّة خَضْرَآء [or fruit of
the terebinth-tree], (K, TA,) which is also sometimes used for rubbing and cleansing the teeth:
when a girl rubs and cleanses her teeth with a stick
of the tree called ضِرْو the saliva with which the
stick is moistened from her mouth is like honey:
(TA:) and the word is also pronounced ↓ ضَرْوٌ.
(K.)

man when he deludes, or circumvents, his companion: (S:) but accord. to IAar, ضرآء here

فُلَانٌ لَا يُدَبُّ لَهُ الضَّرَآءُ [app. meaning The thicket
will not be crept through to such a one: but mentioned after the last of the explanations here following]. (M.) [See also ضَرَّآءُ, in art. ضر.] ―

concealing, oneself: (AA, K, TA:) [or] the walking, or going along, in that which conceals one
from him whom one beguiles, or circumvents. (M.)

occurring in a trad. of 'Alee, is said to mean The
jar that runs [or leaks]; and the drinking from
it is forbidden because it renders the drinking
troublesome: thus expl. by IAar: but it is also
