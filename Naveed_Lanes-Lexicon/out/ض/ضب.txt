-A8-  [ضَبَّ and ↓ ضبّب, each probably followed by عَلَى, seem to signify sometimes It
covered a thing, and became intermixed with it:
the inf. ns. الضبب (which I think to be a mistranscription for الضَّبُّ) and التضبيب are expl. in
the TA as signifying “ the covering a thing, and
the entering of one part, or portion, of it into
another: ” see two explanations of each of these
verbs, followed by عَلَى, voce أَضَبَّ.]

point of getting possession of it, namely, a thing

ضَبْضبَ He bore rancour, malevolence,
malice, or spite; or hid enmity, and violent
hatred, in his heart. (O, TA.)
ضَبٌّ [A species of lizard; termed lacerta
caudiverbera, from its habit of striking with its
tail; (see جَرَشَ;) Forskål (Descr. Animalium,
p. 13,) terms it lacerta Aegyptia; referring to
Hasselquist, p. 302; and adds the following
description: “ femora teretia sine verrucis: cauda
verticillata non longa: squamæ patentes, subconicæ
mucronatæ: corpus nudum, rugosum: ”] a certain
reptile, or small creeping thing, (S, TA,) of those
termed حَشَرَات, (TA,) well known; (K, TA;)
resembling the وَرَل [q. v., but not so long]: (TA:)
or resembling the حِرْذَون [q. v.]; of which there
are two species, one of the size of the حرذون, and
one larger: (Msb:) accord. to 'Abd-El-Káhir,
of the size of a little young crocodile; having a
tail like the tail of the latter: it assumes various
colours when exposed to the sun, like as does the
chameleon; lives seven hundred years; drinks not
water, being satisfied with the air; voids one drop
of urine in every forty days; its teeth consist of
one curved piece; when it has quitted its hole it
knows it not; and it lays eggs, like a bird: so say
IKh and Dmr and others: AM says, the وَرَل is
of a lank make, with a long tail; the latter
resembling that of a serpent; and the length of
some exceeds two cubits; but the tail of the ضبّ
is jointed, and its utmost length is a span: the
Arabs deem the ورل a foul and filthy thing, and
do not eat it; but they are eager to hunt and eat
the ضبّ: this animal has a rough tail, serrated
with jags resembling vertebræ; its colour inclines
to a blackish dusty hue; and when it becomes fat,
its breast becomes yellow; it eats nothing but [the
locusts called] جَنَادِب, and young locusts before
their wings have grown (دَبًا), and herbage, not
venomous or noxious reptiles; whereas the ورل
eats scorpions and serpents and chameleons and
beetles: its flesh is an antidote against poisons,
and women grow fat upon it: (L, TA:) it is the
longest, of the animals, in retaining the remains
of life: (O:) [see also مُطَبِّخٌ:] the fem. is with
ة: (S, O, Msb, K:) and the pl. [of pauc.] is
أَضُبٌّ and [of mult.] ضِبَابٌ (S, O, Mgh, Msb,
K) and ضُبَّانٌ, (K,) which last Lh particularizes
as used to denote a great number, but ISd sees
no reason for this distinction, (TA,) and [quasipl. n.] ↓ مَضَبَّةٌ, (O, K,) like as مَشْيَخَةٌ is of شَيْخٌ,
(O,) this last on the authority of As, as heard by him
from more than one of the Arabs. (TA.) Hence
one says رَجُلٌ خَبٌّ ضَبٌّ (tropical:)  [A very deceitful or
mischievous, and] an abominable, guileful, ireful
man: (TA:) or a very deceitful or mischievous
or wicked, and guileful man: (S:) likened to the
[lizard called] ضَبّ on account of his guilefulness:
and in like manner, اِمْرَأَةٌ خَبَّةٌ ضَبَّةٌ. (A, TA.)
And أَخْدَعُ مِنَ الضَّبِّ More guileful than the
ضبّ: (A, TA:) a prov. (TA.) And أَعَقُّ مِنْ
ضَبٍّ [More undutiful to kindred than a ضبّ];
because the ضبّ often eats its حُسُول [or young
ones when they have just come forth from the
eggs]: another prov.: (S:) أَبُو حِسْلٍ is a surname of the ضبّ. (TA.) One says also أَطْوَلُ
ذَمَآءً مِنَ الضَّبِّ, another prov. [expl. in art. ذمى].
(O.) And أَحْيَرُ مِنْ ضَبٍّ, which is likewise a
prov. [expl. in art. حير]. (Har p. 166.) And
أَتُعْلِمُنِى بِضَبٍّ أَنَا حَرَشْتُهُ, another prov. [expl. in
art. حرش]. (TA.) And لَا أَفْعَلُهُ حَتَّى يَحِنَّ
الضَّبُّ فِى إِثْرِ الإِبِلِ الصَّادِرَةِ [I will not do it until
the ضبّ utters a yearning cry at the heels of the
camels returning from water]: and لَا أَفْعَلُهُ حَتَّى
يَرِدَ الضَّبُّ [I will not do it until the ضبّ comes to
water: i. e. I will never do it:] because the ضبّ
does not drink water. (S, O.) كَفُّ الضَّبِّ
[means The paw of the ضبّ]: to this the Arabs
liken the hand of the niggard when he fails to give:
(TA:) and it is also applied by way of comparison to (tropical:)  a niggard himself: and to denote
(tropical:)  shortness and littleness. (A, TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence also,]
(tropical:)  Rancour, malevolence, malice, or spite, (S, A, O,
Msb, K, TA,) latent in the heart; (A, TA;) like the
[lizard called] ضبّ hiding itself in the furthest
extremity of its hole: (A:) and anger, wrath, or
rage: (K:) or rancour, &c., or vehement rancour,
&c., and enmity: (TA:) and ↓ ضِبٌّ signifies
the same: (K:) the pl. is ضِبَابٌ, and [app. ضِبَبٌ
also, for] the phrase كُلٌّ مِنْهُمَا حَامِلُ ضِبَبٍ لِصَاحِبِهِ
[Each of them a bearer of latent rancours &c.
towards his fellow] occurs in a trad. (TA.)
-A2-
Also A certain disease in the lip, (S, O, Msb,
K,) in consequence of which it flows with
blood, (S, O, Msb,) or swells, and becomes hard,
or dry and hard, and flows with blood. (TA.)
―
-b2-  And A tumour in the breast of a camel.
(O, K.) ―
-b3-  And A tumour (S, O, K) in the خُفّ,
(so in copies of the K [i. e. foot], in the TA انف
[which is, I doubt not, a mistranscription],) or
in the فِرْسِن, [which means the same, or the
extremity of the foot,] (S, O,) of the camel. (S,
O, K.) ―
-b4-  And A disease in the elbow of a camel;
(K, TA;) said to be its cutting into his skin [by
rubbing against it]; or its being distorted, and
falling against his side, so as to gall it. (TA.) ―
-b5-
And A chapping, or cracking, (اِنَفِتَاقٌ,) [in the
crease] of the armpit [of a child, or of a camel],
and abundance of flesh: (S, O, TA:) El-
'Adebbes El-Kinánee gives the same explanation,
and says that this is what is also termed ضَاغِطٌ.
(TA. [See 5.])
-A3-  Also The طَلْع [i. e. the spadix,
or the spathe,] of the palm-tree: pl. ضِبَابٌ: (S,
O:) or ↓ ضَبَّةٌ signifies, (K, TA,) and so ضَبٌّ,
(TA,) [but the latter seems to be a coll. gen. n.,
and the former its n. un.,] a طَلْعَة [meaning
spathe of a palm-tree] before it cleaves open (K,
TA) from [around] the غَرِيض [or spadix]. (TA.)

―
-b3-  And (tropical:)  A broad piece of iron with which a door
(or wood, TA) is clamped or strengthened (يُضَبَّبُ):
(S, Mgh, O, K, TA:) or a piece of iron or brass
or the like, with which a vessel is repaired: (Msb:)
[a word still used in these senses; commonly applied to a flat piece of iron or the like, which is
nailed across a crack in a wooden vessel or a similar
thing: and a band of metal which is affixed around
a cracked vessel: (see an ex. voce عَصَبَ:) also to
a kind of wooden lock, figured and described in
the Introduction to my work on the Modern
Egyptians:] what is first described above is so
called because it is broad, like the reptile so
termed; and also كَتِيفَةٌ, because it is broad, like
a كَتِف [or shoulder-blade]: (AM, TA:) pl. ضَبَّاتٌ
(A, Msb, TA) and ضِبَابٌ. (A, TA.) The ضَبَّة of
a knife is The جُزْءَة [thereof; app. meaning a
ferrule, or similar thing, affixed around the handle,
next the blade, like the band of metal thus called
which is affixed around a cracked vessel (as
