ضرب1
ضَرَبَهُ, aor.
ضَرِبَ, (S, O, K, &c.,) inf. n. ضَرْبٌ,
(S, O, &c.,) [He beat, struck, smote, or hit, him,
or it;] and ↓ ضرّبهُ [signifies the same in an intensive sense, i. e. he beat, &c., him, or it, much,
or violently; or in a frequentative sense, i. e.
several, or many, times: or rather ضرّب is used
in relation to several, or many, objects, as will
be shown in what follows]: (K:) accord. to
Er-Rághib, الضَّرْبُ signifies the making a thing
to fall upon another thing; and, as some say,
the making it to fall with violence, or vehemence.
(TA.) You say, ضَرَبَهُ بِهِ [He struck him, or it,
with it], i. e. with a sword, (A, Mgh, Msb), &c.
(A, Msb.) And تَضْرِبُ فِى حَدِيدٍ بَارِدٍ [Thou
beatest upon cold iron]: a prov. [expl. in art.
حد]. (Har p. 633.) And ضَرَبْتُ زَيْدًا سَوْطًا,
meaning بِسَوْطٍ [i. e. I struck Zeyd with a whip],

سوط, q. v.:) and ضَرَبَهُ مِائَةَ سَوْطٍ [He struck him
a hundred strokes of the whip]. (S and K in art.
سحل, &c.) And ضَرَبْتُ عُنُقَهُ [I smote his neck,
meaning I beheaded him]; and الأَعْنَاقَ ↓ ضَرَّبْتُ
[I smote the necks, meaning I struck off the
heads]; the teshdeed denoting muchness [of the
action] or multiplicity [of the objects]: AZ says
that, when the object is one, the Arabs use only
the former verb, without teshdeed; but when
there is a plurality of objects, either of the verbs;
(Msb;) [so that] one says, ضَرَبُوا أَعْنَاقَهُمْ [They
smote their necks, or beheaded them], and أَمَرَ
الرِّقَابِ ↓ بِتَضْرِيبِ [He gave the order to smite
the necks, or to strike off the heads]: (A:) فَضَرْبَ
الرِّقَابِ in the Kur xlvii. 4 is originally فَاضْرِبُوا
الرِّقَابَ ضَرْبًا [meaning Then do ye smite the necks,
i. e. strike off the heads]; (Bd;) the inf. n. being
here put for its verb. (Jel.) [Respecting the
phrase هُوَ الْيَضْرِبُكَ, see 1 in art. جدع.] ―

ii. 58, considered as meaning (assumed tropical:)  Vileness was made
to cleave to them: or the meaning is, (assumed tropical:)  encompassed them, like as the tent encompasses him

آذَانِهِمْ [in the Kur xviii. 10] means (tropical:)  We prevented
their sleeping; (K, TA;) as though by putting
a covering over their ears; a metonymical [and
elliptical] mode of saying we made them to sleep

have awoke: (Zj, L, TA:) or ضَرَبَ عَلَى آذَانِهِمْ

ضِرَابٌ (S, A, Msb, K) and ضَرْبٌ also, accord. to
Fr, but this latter, though agreeable with analogy,
is disallowed by Sb and Akh, (TA,) (tropical:)  The
stallion leaped the she-camel; (Msb, TA;) i. e.

used by the people of the Time of Ignorance
when they doubted whether they should undertake an affair or abstain from it. (Har pp. 465
and 553.) One says also, ضَرَبَ فِى الجَزُورِبِسَهْمٍ
meaning (assumed tropical:)  He obtained a share, or portion, of the
slaughtered camel. (Mgh.) And hence the saying
of El-Hareeree, وَضَرَبْتُ فِى مَرْعَاهَا بِنَصِيبٍ (assumed tropical:)  [And
I obtained a share of its pasture]. (Mgh.) And
the lawyers say, يَضْرِبُ فِيهِ بِالثُّلُثِ i. e. (assumed tropical:)  He shall

an example, or a proverb; said of God [and of a
man]: (S, * O, * Msb, TA:) or he mentioned, or
set forth, a parable, &c.: or he framed a parable:
thus expl., the verb has but one objective complement: or the phrase signifies he made [such a
thing] an example, or the subject of a parable or
similitude &c.; and so has two objective complements: in the saying in the Kur [xxxvi. 12]
وَاضْرِبْ لَهُمْ مَثَلًا أَصْحَابَ الْقَرْيَةِ (assumed tropical:)  [And propound
thou to them a parable, the people of the town]
i. e., the story of the people of the town, [or make
thou to them a parable, or similitude, or an
example, the people of the town;] مثلا may be in
the accus. case as an objective complement,
اضحاب القرية being a substitute for مثلا; or
اصحاب القرية may be regarded as a second
objective complement [i. e. second in the order of
the words, but first in the order of the sense]:
the phrase is differently expl. on account of the
different meanings of the verb ضَرَبَ; which signifies he described, or rehearsed; and he declared,
propounded, or explained; and he made, caused
to be, or constituted; &c.; accord. to some, it is
taken from the phrase ضَرَبَ الدِرْهَمَ [q. v.];
because of the impression which a parable or the
like makes upon the mind: accord. to some, from
ضَرِيبٌ signifying “ a like; ” because the first
thing is made like the second: accord. to some,
from ضَرَبَ الطِّينَ عَلَى الجِدَارِ [q. v.; because the
mud, applied as a plaster, conforms to the shape
of the wall]: and accord. to some, from ضَرَبَ
الخَاتَمَ [q. v.]; because of the correspondence
between a parable or the like and the object to
which it is applied, and the correspondence between the signet and its impression. (TA, from
the M and L &c.) يَضْرِبُ اللّٰهُ الْحَقَّ وَالْباطِلَ, in

or arithmeticians, means The multiplying a
number by another number; (Mgh, Msb;) as
when you say, [ضَرَبَ خَمْسةً فِى سِتَّةٍ He multiplied five by six; and] خَمْسَةٌ فِى سِتَّةٍ بِثَلَاثِينَ
[Five multiplied by six is thirty]. (Msb.) ―
