ضَازَ, (S, K,) aor. يَضِيزُ, inf. n. ضَيْزٌ, (TA,)
He deviated from the right course; or acted unjustly,
wrongfully, injuriously, or tyrannically; (S, K;)
فِى الحُكْمِ in the judgment: (S:) like ضَأَزَ. (TA
in art. ضأز.) ―
-b2-  ضَازَهُ حَقَّهُ, aor. and inf. n. as
above, He deprived him, or defrauded him, of a
part, or the whole, of his right, or due: (S, M,
K:) like ضَازَهُ, aor. يَضُوزُهُ: (K:) he refused it to
him, or withheld it from him: (AZ, M, TA:)

ضَأْزٌ. (S, TA.)
قِسْمَةٌ ضِيزَى An unjust, (S, M,) or a defective, (K
in art. ضأز,) division: (S, M, K:) as also ضُوزَى:
(M:) ضيزى in the Kur liii. 22 is read by all
without hemz: (TA:) it is of the measure فُعْلَى,
like طُوبَى and حُبْلَى; but the ض is with kesr
in order that the ى may remain unchanged; for
there is not in the language an epithet of the
measure فِعْلَى; this being a measure of substantives, like الشِّعْرَى and الدِّفْلَى: (S:) or,
accord. to Aboo-' Alee, it is not an epithet, but an
inf. n., like ذِكْرَى, as though the meaning were
قِسْمَةٌ ذَاتُ جَوْرٍ: (Har p. 524:) Fr says that
some of the Arabs say ضَأْزَى, and ضُؤْزَى: and
AHát mentions AZ's having heard the Arabs say
ضِئْزَى, with hemz. (S.)
