ضهيأQ. 1
ضَهْيَاَ [Accord. to the O and K, Q. Q. 1, being
mentioned therein in art. ضهأ.] ضَهْيَأَ أَمْرَهُ He
fell short of doing what he ought to have done in
his affair, (مَرَّضَهُ, O, K,) and did not decide it,
(لَمْ يَصْرِمْهُ, O,) or and did not perform it firmly,
or soundly: (K:) like رَهْيَأَ. (TA.)
ضَهْيَأٌ, of the measure فَعْلَلٌ, or, as some say,
فَعْيَلٌ; if of the latter, [said to be] the only instance of this measure in the language; ضَهْيَدٌ
being a foreign proper name; (TA;) or,
مَرْيَمُ being a foreign proper name; (TA;) or,
accord. to Sb, the hemzeh in ضَهْيَأٌ, which is with
tenween, is augmentative, because it is syn. with
ضَهْيَآءُ, which is with the long ا and imperfectly
decl., for the ى cannot be augmentative and the
hemzeh radical in the latter; (MF and TA in
art. ضهى;) [a word like ضَهْيًا and ضَهْيَآءُ (which
see in art. ضهى) in most, or a some seem to
say in all, of its meanings;] A certain tree,
resembling the سَيَال, (AZ, O, K,) each of which
has its fruit in a سِنْفَة [or pod]; it has weak
thorns, and grows in the valleys and on the mountains: (AZ, O:) Ed-Deenawaree [i. e. AHn]
says, on the authority of some one or more of the
Arabs of the desert, of El-Azd, that the ضهيأ is a
great tree of the kind called عِضَاه, having a بَرَمَة
[q. v.] and a pod (عُلَّّفَة) [which succeeds the بَرَمَة],
and many thorns; its pods (عُلَّف) are intensely
red, and its leaves are like those of the [species of
acacia called] سَمُر. (O.)
-A2-  Also A woman that
does not menstruate: and that has neither milk
nor breast: as also ↓ ضَهْيَأَةٌ: (K:) or the latter
is an epithet applied to a woman in these two
senses: (O: [in which the former word, without
ة, is not mentioned:]) Seer says, in his Expos.
of “ the Book ” of Sb, that ضَهْيَأٌ, like ضَهْيَآءُ
[which belongs to art. ضهى], is a subst. as well
as an epithet, signifying a woman whose breast
has not grown forth: and one who has not menstruated: ―
-b2-  and also (assumed tropical:)  A land that has not
given growth to anything: (MF, TA:) or ↓ ضَهْيَأَةٌ
signifies as above: and also (assumed tropical:)  a desert (فَلَاةٌ)
having in it no water: (O, K, TA:) or that does
not give growth to anything; app. because it has
no water. (TA.) [Accord. to those who hold
the ى to be augmentative,] a woman is thus
termed because she resembles men (لِأَنَّهَا ضَاهَأَتِ
الرِّجَالَ). (O, TA.)
ضَهْيَأَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in
two places.
