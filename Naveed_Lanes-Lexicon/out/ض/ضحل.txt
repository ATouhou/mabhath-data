Q. Q. 4
اِضْمَحَلَّ, (S, O, K,) mentioned in the
K in a separate art., its author, and some others,
holding the م to be radical, but most of the leading authorities on inflection hold it, with J [and

fully and variously] in art. اتن; (K;) so called
because the water does not cover it by reason of
its paucity. (S, O.) ―

ضَحْوٌ, (S, and so in the CK,) or ضُحُوٌّ, (so in
other copies of the K and in the TA,) like عُلُوٌّ,
thus accord. to ISd and IKtt, (TA,) and ضُحِىٌّ,
(TA as from the K, [but not in the CK nor in
my MS. copy of the K,]) The road appeared, or
became apparent, (S, K,) to a person: so says
AZ: (S:) [and so, app., signifies ضَحِىَ, aor.
يَضْحَى; for] As says, يُسْتَحَبُّ مِنَ الفَرَسِ أَنْ
يَضْحَى عِجَانُهُ i. e. [It is approved as a quality
of the horse] that his عجان [q. v., a word

becomes sun, he himself becomes nought. (IAmb,
TA.) ―
-b5-  And ضَحَا and ضَحِىَ, aor. of each
يَضْحَى, inf. n. ضَحْوٌ, (K, TA,) or, accord. to

therein nor shalt thou be smitten by the sun];
i. e., thou shalt be preserved from the heat of the

and ضُحِىٌّ, He went forth to the sunshine; (K;)

think we should read البُرُوزُ:] or ضَحِيتُ لِلشَّمْسِ,
inf. n. ضَحَآءٌ; and ضَحَيْتُ also; aor. of each
أَضْحَى; I went forth to the sunshine. (S.) أَضْحِ
[the imperative of ↓ أَضْحَى] occurs in a trad.,
accord. to the relaters thereof: but As says that
it is [correctly] اِضْحَ, with kesr to the ا and fet-h
to the ح; from ضَحِيتُ; being a command to go
forth to the sunshine. (S.) ―
-b7-  And ضَحِىَ, (S,
K,) inf. n. ضَحًى [or ضَحًا], He (a man, S)
sweated. (S, K.)
2
ضَحَّيْنَاهُمْ is like صَبَّحْنَاهُمْ [i. e. it signifies
We came to them in the time of the morning
called الضُّحَى]: (TA:) and ↓ ضاحاهُ, (K, TA,)
inf. n. مُضَاحَاةٌ, is similar to غَادَاهُ and رَاوَحَهُ,
meaning, (TA,) He came to him in the time
called الضُّحَى. (K, TA.) ―
-b2-  ضحّى الغَنَمَ He
pastured the sheep, or goats, in the time called
الضُّحَى; (S, K, TA;) and in like manner, الإِبِلَ
the camels. (TA.) And ضَحَّيْتُ الإِبِلَ عَنِ الوِرْدِ
I pastured the camels with the [morning-pasture
called] ↓ ضَحَآء, so that they might come to the
water having satisfied themselves with food: and
in like manner, عَشَّيْتُهَا عَنْهُ “ I pastured them with
the [evening-pasture called] عَشَآء,” &c. (A, TA.)
―
-b3-  [Hence,] ضَحَّيْتُهُ, inf. n. تَضْحِيَةٌ, I fed him in
the time called الضُّحَى: (K, TA:) or I fed him
with the [morning-meal called] غَدَآء, at any time
[of the morning]; but more commonly known as
meaning, in the time called الضُّحَى: and the
verb primarily relates to camels [and sheep or
goats]: or ضحّى قَوْمَهُ means he fed his people, or
party, with the [morning-meal called] غَدَآء; or
he invited them [thereto, i. e.] to his ضَحَآء. (TA.)
―
-b4-  IAth says, when the Arabs, in their journeying, or migrating, passed by a piece of land in
which was herbage, one of them said, أَلَا ضَحُّوا
رُوَيْدًا, meaning [Now] be ye gentle with the camels
↓ حَتَّى نَتَضَحَّى i. e. in order that we may obtain
of this herbage; then التَّضْحِيَةُ was applied to
mean the being gentle in order that the camels
may reach the place of alighting [app. in the
morning] having satisfied themselves with food:
and then ↓ تَضَحَّى was said of anyone as meaning
he ate in the time called [الضُّحَى or] الضَّحَآء.
(TA.) One says, ضَحَّيْتُ عَنِ الشَّىْءِ (assumed tropical:)  I was
gentle, or I acted gently, with the thing. (S.)
And ضحّى عَنِ الأَمْرِ (tropical:)  He acted gently, or deliberately, in the affair: and so عَشَّى عَنْهُ. (A,
TA.) And ضَحِّ رُوَيْدًا, (S, A, TA,) a prov.,
(A, TA,) meaning (tropical:)  Hasten thou not; (S, TA;)
from تَضْحِيَةُ الإِبِلِ عَنِ الوِرْدِ: [see the third
sentence of this paragraph:] or meaning be thou
patient a little while: (TA:) or the meaning is,
slaughter thou, or sacrifice thou, [deliberately,
leisurely, or] without haste: (Meyd:) [for] ―
-b5-
ضحّى, inf. n. تَضْحيَةٌ, signifies [also] He slaughtered, or sacrificed, the [victim termed] أُضْحِيَّة, in
the time called الضُّحَى: and hence, by reason of
frequency of usage, he did so in any time of what
are termed أَيَّامُ التَّشْرِيقِ: (Msb:) and ضحّى
بِشَاةٍ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) or بِكَبْشٍ أَوْ غَيْرِهِ, (Mgh,)
he slaughtered, or sacrificed, a sheep or goat, (S,
Msb, K,) or a ram or other [victim], (Mgh,) in
the time called الضُّحَى (Mgh, K) of the day called
يَوْمُ الأَضْحَى; and afterwards said of him who
has done so [at any time, even] in the last part
of the [said] day. (Mgh.)
-A2-  See also 4.
-A3-  And
see 5.

ضاحت البِلَدُ The countries, or lands, became exposed to the sun, and their herbage consequently dried up. (TA.)
-A2-  ضاحاهُ: see 2, first
sentence.
4
اضحى He (a man, TA) entered upon the
time of morning called الضُّحَى, (K, * TA,) or the
time called الضَّحْوَة, (TA,) [or the time called
الضَّحَآء, for] you say, أَقَمْتُ بِالمَكَانِ حَتَّى أَضْحَيْتُ,
from الضَّحَآءُ [and therefore meaning I remained
in the place until I entered upon the time called
الضَّحَآء], like as you say أَصْبَحْتُ from الصَّبَاحُ.
(S, TA.) Hence the saying of 'Omar, أَضْحُوا
لِصَلَاةِ الضُّحَى, (S,) or بِصَلَاةِ الضُّحَى, (TA,) i. e.
Perform ye the prayer of the time called الضحى
at its [proper] time: do not delay it until the
time called الضَّحَآء has become advanced: (TA:)
or do not perform that prayer when the time called
الضُّحَى has become advanced. (S.) ―
-b2-  And you
say, اضحى فُلَانٌ يَفْعَلُ كَذَا, (S, M, K,) like as
you say ظَلَّ يفعل كذا; (S;) meaning Such a
one became occupied, or engaged, in the time called
الضُّحَى in doing such a thing: (M, K, TA:) or
did such a thing in the first part of the day,
(IKtt, TA.) ―
-b3-  [This phrase often means also
Such a one became occupied, or engaged, in doing
such a thing; betook, set, or applied, himself to
doing such a thing; set about, or commenced,
doing such a thing; or began to do such a thing;
like أَصْبَحَ and ظَلَّ &c. And, like these verbs,
اضحى followed by an aor., or by a part. n. in
the accus. case, often requires to be rendered
simply He, or it, became: see an ex. in a verse
cited voce دَفِئٌ.] ―
-b4-  اضحى also signifies He
performed the supererogatory act of prayer
(النَّافِلَة) in the time called الضُّحَى. (TA.) ―
-b5-
See also 1, last sentence but one. ―
-b6-  One says
also, اضحى عَنِ الأَمْرِ, meaning (tropical:)  He withdrew
himself far from the affair. (TA. [See also
another meaning of this phrase in what follows.])
And القَطا يُضْحِى عَنِ المَآءِ (tropical:)  The birds called قطا
go far from water. (TA.)
-A2-  اضحى الشَّىْءَ He
made apparent, showed, or revealed, the thing.
(K, TA.) And عَنِ الأَمْرِ ↓ ضحّى He made the
affair, or case, apparent, or manifest: and [so
اضحى عَنْهُ, for] one says, أَضْحِ لِى عَنْ أَمْرِكَ,
with fet-h to the ء, meaning Make manifest to me
thy affair, or case: so in the M. (TA.) ―
-b2-  لَا أَضْحَى
اللّٰهُ لَنَا ظِلَّكَ is a deprecatory phrase [lit. May God
not cause thy shadow to become sun to us: meaning (assumed tropical:)  may God not deprive us of thee by death:
(see ضَحَا ظِلُّهُ:) or it may be similar in meaning
to the phrase here following]. (TA.) لَا تُضْحِنَا
عَنْ ظِلِّكَ [lit. Make us not to go forth into the
sun from thy shadow] means (assumed tropical:)  withdraw not
from us the shadow of thy compassion: the verb
being made trans. by means of عن because the
phrase implies the meaning of لَا تُخْرِجْنَا مِنْهُ: and
ظلّ being here used metaphorically. (Har p. 4.)
5
تَضحّى: see 1, latter half. ―
-b2-  And see 2,
in two places. It [generally] means He ate in
the time of morning called الضُّحَى: (K:) or he
ate the [morning-meal called] غَدَآء; syn. تَغَدَّى:
(S, TA:) and ↓ ضحّى also has the former [or
the latter] meaning. (ISd, TA.)
10
إِسْتَ1ْ2َ3َ see 1, latter half.
ضَحْوٌ: see the next paragraph.
ضُحًى, also written ضُحًا, held by some to be
of the measure فُعَلٌ, and by others to be [originally ضُحْوًى i. e.] of the measure فُعْلًى, of
the former measure accord. to Mbr, and of the
latter accord. to Th, (MF, TA,) [The early
part of the forenoon, after sunrise: accord. to
some, when the sun is yet low: accord. to others,
when the sun is somewhat high:] i. q. ↓ ضَحْوَةٌ,
accord. to most authorities: (MF, TA, and so
in one place in the K:) or this latter signifies
the period of the day after sunrise: (S:) or
this signifies the advanced state of the day
(اِرْتِفَاعُ النَّهَارِ [which is said by the doctors of
the law in the present day to mean when the sun
has risen the measure of a رُمْح, q. v., or more]);
as also ↓ ضَحْوٌ and ↓ ضَحِيَّةٌ: (K:) and the ضُحَى
is after the ضَحْوَة (S, K) a little, (K,) when
the sun shines brightly: (S:) or from sunrise to
the time when the day is advanced and very
white: thus in the M: (TA:) or it is the
spreading of the sun [upon the earth], and the
extending of the day: and the time [thereof]
is thus named: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or ضُحًى is
pl. of ↓ ضَحْوَةٌ, like as قُرًى is of قَرْيَةٌ; and its
sing. is like ↓ ضَحَآءٌ, which means the extending
of the day, and is of the masc. gender, as though
a name of the time [thereof]: then ضُحًى became
used as a sing., and the time was thus called:
(Msb:) it is fem. and masc.: (S, K: *) he who
makes it fem. holds it to be pl. of ↓ ضَحْوَةٌ;
and he who makes it masc. holds it to be [a
sing.] noun of the measure فُعَلٌ, like صُرَدٌ and
نُغَرٌ: (S:) its dim. is ↓ضُحَىٌّ, without ة; (Fr,
Msb, K;) for they disapproved the affixing the
ة lest it should be confounded with the dim. of
ضَحْوَةٌ. (Fr, Msb.) Using it as an adv. noun,
you say, لَقِيتُهُ ضُحَى, when you mean [I met
him] in the ضحى of this day; without tenween.
(S, TA.) See also ضَحْوَةٌ. [See also De Sacy's
Chrest. Ar., sec. ed., i. 162-167, respecting the
prayer that is performed in the time thus called,
i. e. the prayer termed صَلَاةُ الضُّحَى, mentioned
above, voce أَضْحَى.] ―
-b2-  Also The sun: (M,
Msb, K:) because of its appearing in the time
thus called. (M, TA.) One says, اِرْتَفَعَتِ الضَّحَى,
meaning The sun became high. (Msb.) ―
-b3-  And
ضُحَى الشَّمْسِ The light of the sun: thus is
expl. xci. 1. of the Kur. (TA.) ―
-b4-  مَا لِكَلَامِهِ
ضُحًى means (assumed tropical:)  His speech, or language, has no
perspicuity: thus in the M and K: but in the A,
↓ أَنْشَدَنِى شَعْرًا لَيْسَ فِيهِ حَلَاوَةٌ وَلَا ضَحَآءٌ i. e.
[He recited to me poetry] in which was no
[sweetness nor] plainness of meaning. (TA.)
ضَحْوَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph,
in three places. You say, أَتَيْتُكَ ضَحْوَةً, meaning
[I came to thee] in a [time called] ↓ ضُحًى [or
rather ضَحْوَة], (K, * TA,) with tenween, unless
you mean of this day [in which case you say
ضَحْوَةٌ, without tenween, like as you say in the
latter case ضُحَى]. (TA.)
ضَحْيَا and ضَحْيَآءُ fems. of أَضْحَى [q. v.].
ضَحْيَانٌ, which should by rule be ضَحْوَانٌ,
Anything exposing itself, or being exposed, to
the sun. (IJ, TA.) قُلَّةٌ ضَحْيَانَةٌ means [A
mountain-top] exposed to the sun: (S, K:) occurring in a saying of Taäbbata-sharrà. (S.) And
عَصًا ضَحْيَانَةٌ A staff, or stick, growing in the sun
so as to be matured thereby, and extremely hard.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  See also أَضْحَى. ―
-b3-  Also A man who
eats in the time called الضُّحَى: fem. with ة. (K.)
ضَحَآءٌ, with medd, (S, Hr, Msb, TA,) and
fet-h, (Hr, Msb, TA, [erroneously written in
copies of the K with damm,]) The period [of
the forenoon] next after that called الضُّحَى;
i. e. when the day is at the highest: (S:) or
the period near midday: (K:) or the period
of the day when the sun has risen to the fourth
part of the sky: (TA:) see also ضُحًى, in two
places. ―
-b2-  And hence, The [morning-meal called]
غَدَآء; because it is eaten in the time thus called.
(S, TA.) [And also applied to Pasture eaten
in that time:] see 2, third sentence.
ضُحَىٌّ dim. of ضُحًى, q. v. (Fr, Msb, K.)

ضَاحِيَةٌ An outer, exterior, or exposed, side or
region or tract of anything: [pl. ضَوَاحٍ: whence]
one says, هُمْ يَنْزِلُونَ الضَّوَاحِىَ [They alight, or
abide, in the exterior tracts]. (S.) [Hence also,]
ضَوَاحِى الرُّومِ The exterior districts of the Greeks.
(K.) And الضَّاحِيَةُ مِنَ البَعْلِ What are in the
open country, of the palm-trees that imbibe with
their roots, without being watered: opposed to
الضَّامِنَةُ مِنَ النَّخْلِ: (AO, S in this art. and in art.
ضمن, q. v.:) and الضَّوَاحِى مِنَ النَّخْلِ what are
outside of the town-wall, of the palm-trees: thus
used, الضواحى is an epithet in which the quality

was, (K,) or was also, (S, and so afterwards in
the K,) the name of a certain mare, belonging to
'Amr Ibn-'Ámir (S, K) Ibn-Rabee'ah. (S.) ―
-b2-
And لَيْلَةٌ ضَحْيَآءُ, (S, K,) and ضَحْيَا with the short
ا, both mentioned by ISd, (TA,) and ↓ إِضْحِيَانَةٌ,
(S, K,) and ↓ إِضْحِيَةٌ accord. to the K, but [SM
says] I have not found any mention of this last,
[meaning except in the K,] and probably the
right word is ↓ إِضحِيَانٌ, as in the books of strange
words together with إِضْحِيَانَةٌ, and accord. to the
“ Irtisháf ed-Darab ” of AHei one says [also]
↓ أَضْحِيَانٌ with fet-h, (TA,) A bright night, (S,
