ضلع1
ضَلَعَ, aor.
ضَلَعَ, (S, O, Msb, K,) inf. n. ضَلْعٌ,
(S, O, Msb,) It, or (assumed tropical:)  he, inclined, or declined:
(S, O, K:) it, or (assumed tropical:)  he, declined, or deviated, from
that which was right, or true: (S, O, Msb, K:)
(assumed tropical:)  he acted wrongfully, unjustly, injuriously, or
tyrannically. (S, * O, * K.) You say, ضَلَعَ عَنْهُ
(tropical:)  He deviated, or turned away, from him, or it;
or he did so, acting wrongfully, &c.: and ضَلَعَ
عَلَيْهِ (assumed tropical:)  he acted wrongfully, &c., against him.
(TA.) And ضَلْعُكَ مَعَ فُلَانٍ (S, O, Msb, * K *)
(assumed tropical:)  Thy inclining, (S, O, Msb, K,) and thy love, or
desire, (S, O,) is with such a one [i. e. in unison
with that of such a one]. (S, O, Msb, * K: * in
the Msb and K, مَعَهُ is put in the place of مَعَ
فُلَانٍ.) And لَا تَنْقُشِ الشَّوْكَةَ بِالشَّوْكَةِ فَإِنَّ ضَلْعَهَا
مَعَهَا, (S, O, K,) or بِمِثْلِهَا [in the place of
بالشوكة], (Meyd,) [lit. Extract not thou the thorn
by means of the thorn, or by means of the like of
it, for its inclination is with it,] meaning, demand
not aid, in the case of thy want, of him who is
more benevolent to the person from whom the
object of want is sought than he is to thee:
(Meyd:) a prov.: (S, Meyd, O:) applied to the
man who contends in an altercation with another,
and says, “Appoint thou between me and thee
such a one; ” pointing to a man who loves what
he [i. e. the opponent of the speaker] loves: (S,
O, K:) the author of the K adds, it is said that
it should by rule be ضَلَعَكَ, for they say ضَلِعَ مَعَ
فُلَانٍ, like فَرِحَ, [as though meaning he inclined
with such a one,] but they have contracted it;
which is wonderful, in consideration with his
having mentioned shortly before, ضَلَعَ, like مَنَعَ,
as signifying مَالَ. (TA.) One says also, خَاصَمْتُ
فُلَانًا فَكَانَ ضَلْعُكَ عَلَىَّ i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [I contended in an
altercation with such a one and] thy inclining
[was against me]. (S, O.) ―
-b2-  ضَلِعَ, aor.
ضَلَعَ,
(Mgh, Msb, K,) inf. n. ضَلَعٌ, (Mgh, Msb,) means
It (a sword, K, or a thing, Msb) was, or became,
crooked, or curved: (Mgh, Msb, K:) and
↓ تضلّع may mean the same: (Ham p. 80:) a
poet says, (namely, Mohammad Ibn-'Abd-Allah
El-Azdee, TA,)
وَقَدْ يَحْمِلُ السَّيْفَ المُجَرَّبَ رَبُّهُ
عَلَى ضَلَعٍ فِى مَتْنِهِ وَهْوَ قَاطِعُ
[And verily, or sometimes, or often, its owner
bears the tried sword, notwithstanding crookedness
in its broad side, it being sharp]: (S, O:) and
(K) ضَلَعٌ signifies the being crooked, or curved,
by nature; (S, O, K;) as also ضَلْعٌ; whence the
saying, لَأُقِيمَنَّ ضَلَعَكَ and ضَلْعَكَ [I will
assuredly straighten thy natural crookedness]:
(K:) thus in the copies of the K; but this is a
mistake, occasioned by the author's seeing in the T
and M لَأُقِيمَنَّ ضَلَعَكَ and صَلَعَكَ meaning عَوَجَكَ,
and his imagining both these nouns to be with
ض and to differ in the manner stated above:
(TA:) you say, ضَلِعَ, aor.
ضَلَعَ, inf. n. ضَلَعٌ i. e.
he, or it, was, or became, crooked, or curved, by
nature: (S, O:) or ضَلَعٌ in the camel is like غَمْزٌ
in horses or the like, [meaning the limping, or
halting, or having a slight lameness, in the hind
leg,] and the verb is ضَلِعَ; and the epithet [or
part. n.] is ↓ ضَلِعٌ: (K:) or this is rather the
explanation of ضَلْعٌ, with ظ; (TA;) [or as Mtr
says,] ضَلْع as meaning what resembles عَرَجٌ [or
natural lameness] is correctly ظَلْع: (Mgh:)
but when it (i. e. the crookedness, TA) is not
natural, one says, ضَلَعَ, like مَنَعَ, (K, TA,) [but
this seems rather to relate to the meaning of
“ limping,” agreeably with what I have cited
above from the Mgh,] and the inf. n. is ضَلْعٌ:
(TA:) and the epithet [or part. n.] is ↓ ضَالِعٌ.
(K.)
-A2-  ضَلُعَ, [aor.
ضَلُعَ,] inf. n. ضَلَاعَةٌ, He (a man,
S, O, Msb, [and app. also a horse and the like,
see its part. n. ضَلِيعٌ,]) was, or became, strong,
or powerful; (S, O, Msb, K;) and strong, hard,
or firm, in the أَضْلَاع [or ribs]. (S, O, K. [The
latter is said in Har p. 6 to be the primary meaning;
and the former, metaphorical.])
-A3-  ضَلَعَ as syn.
with تَضَلَّعَ: see the latter.
-A4-  ضَلَعَ فُلَانًا He
struck such a one upon his ضِلَع [or rib]. (K.)

-b2-  تَضْلِيعُ الأَعْمَالِ is
said by some to mean (assumed tropical:)  The making deeds to
deviate from the right, or direct, way or course:
and by some to mean (assumed tropical:)  the making them heavy,
or burdensome. (Har p. 77.) ―
-b3-  تَضْلِيعُ الثَّوْبِ
signifies The figuring the garment, or piece of
cloth, with the form of أَضْلَاع [or ribs]. (S, O, K.)
[See also the pass. part. n., below.]
4
اضلعهُ, (K,) inf. n. إِضْلَاعٌ, (S, O,) It, or
he, made it, or (assumed tropical:)  him, to incline, or decline; (S,
O, K;) [and so ↓ ضلّعهُ; for] الإِضْلَاعُ and
التَّضْلِيعُ signify الإِمَالَةُ. (Har p. 77.) ―
-b2-  [And
It, or he, made it, or him, to be crooked, or
curved; and so ↓ ضلّعهُ; for] الإِضْلَاعُ and التَّضْلِيعُ
signify also التَّعْوِيجُ. (Har ubi suprà.) ―
-b3-
[Hence,] one says also, أَضْلَعَتْهُ الخُطُوبُ, meaning
(assumed tropical:)  [Affairs, or great or grievous affairs,] burdened
him [as though making him to incline, or curving
him]. (TA.)
-A2-  See also 8.
5
تضلّع: see 1, in the middle of the paragraph.
―
-b2-  [Also,] (S, O, K,) and ↓ ضَلَعَ, like مَنَعَ, (K,)
said of a man, (S, O,) He became filled, (S, O,
K,) or what was between his أَضْلَاع [or ribs]
became filled, (TA,) with food, (S, O, K,) or
drink: (S, O:) or with drink so that the water
reached his أَضْلَاع, (K, TA,) and they became
swollen out in consequence thereof: (TA in explanation of the former verb:) and the former
verb is also expl. as meaning he drank much, so
that his side and his ribs became stretched. (TA.)
And تضلّع مِنَ الطَّعَامِ He became filled with the
food; as though it filled his ribs. (Msb.)
8
الاِضْطِلَاعُ is from الضَّلَاعَةُ [inf. n. of ضَلُعَ]
meaning “ the being strong, or powerful; ” (ISk,
S, O, and Har p. 391;) الاِضْطِلَاعُ بِالشَّىْءِ signifying The raising the thing upon one's back, and
rising with it, and having strength, or power,
sufficient for it. (Har ibid.) And you say,
اضطلع بِحَمْلِهِ, meaning He had strength, or
power, to bear it, or carry it. (Mgh, and Har
p. 645.) [See also the part. n., below.] And
بِالأَمْرِ ↓ أَضْلَعَ (assumed tropical:)  He had strength, or power, sufficient for the affair; as though his ribs had
strength to bear it. (Msb.)

sense, from ضَلُعَ; (Msb;) and the bearing, or
endurance of that which is heavy, or burdensome.

TA.) And applied to a spear as meaning
Crooked, or curved; not straightened: (TA:)
or, so applied, inclining, or bending: (Ham
p. 80:) and ↓ ضَلِيعٌ and ↓ ضَالِعٌ, so applied,
[likewise] mean crooked, or curved. (TA.) ―
-b2-

former of the dial. of El-Hijáz and the latter of
the dial. of Temeem, (Msb, TA,) and ↓ ضَلْعٌ,
which is the only form, or almost the only one,

in this case is preferred by Ibn-Málik and others,

and [of pauc.] أَضْلَاعٌ (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K) and
أَضْلُعٌ, (O, Msb, K,) and أَضَالِعُ also is a pl. of
ضِلَعٌ, or, as some say, of [its pl.] أَضْلُعٌ. (TA.)
ضِلَعُ الخَلْفِ [and الخِلْفِ] is [The rib] in the
lowest part of the side [of a man, i. e. the lowest
rib; and the hindmost rib in a beast]: (TA:)
and signifies also A burn in the part behind what
is thus termed. (O, K, TA.) ―
-b2-  Also (assumed tropical:)  A piece
of stick or wood; syn. عُودٌ; [erroneously supposed by Golius and Freytag to mean here the
musical instrument thus called;] (IAar, O, K;)

in the wood of which are a bending (عَطْفٌ) and
an evenness (تَقَوُّمٌ, as in the O and K, or تَقْوِيمٌ,
as in the L), [app. towards each extremity,] the
rest of it (سَائِرُهَا) being similar to its كَبِد [which
means its middle part, or part where it is grasped
with the hand, or part against which the arrow
goes, &c., for it is variously explained]; (O, K,
TA;) so accord. to As, (O, TA,) and AHn;
(TA;) as also ↓ ضَلِيعٌ, (O, K, TA,) and ↓ ضَلِيعَةٌ;
for which last, مَضْلُوعَةٌ is erroneously repeated
in the K; [app. from its author finding it said
in the O that such a bow is termed ضَلِيعٌ and
مَضْلُوعَةٌ; and in the TK, مُضَوْلَعَةٌ is substituted
for it:] ↓ قَوْسٌ ضَلِيعَةٌ is also expl. as meaning a
thick bow. (TA.)
مُضْطَلِعٌ is from الضَّلَاعَةُ [inf. n. of ضَلُعَ]: so in
the saying, فُلَانٌ مُضْطَلِعٌ بِهٰذَا الأَمْرِ i. e. Such a
one is possessed of strength, or power, sufficient for
this affair: so says ISk: and he adds that one
should not say مُطَّلِعٌ: Aboo-Nasr Ahmad Ibn-
Hátim says, one says هُوَ مُضْطَلِعٌ بِهٰذَا الأَمْرِ and
مُطَّلِعٌ له [also]; الاِضْطِلَاعُ being from الضَّلَاعَةُ
meaning القُوَّةُ; and الاِطِّلَاعُ being from العُلُوُّ,
from the saying اِطَّلَعْتُ الثَّنِيَّةَ meaning عَلَوْتُهَا [I
ascended upon the mountain, or mountain-road,
termed ثَنِيَّة]; i. e. he is one who has ascendancy
with respect to this affair, who is master of it:
(S, O, TA:) Lth expressly allows مُطَّلِعٌ for
مُضْطَلِعٌ by the incorporation of the ض into the
[letter that is originally] ت, so that the two
together become ط with teshdeed. (TA.) And
لِهٰذَا الأَمْرِ ↓ هُوَ مُضْلِعٌ means the same as مُضْطَلِعٌ
as first expl. above, i. e. He is possessed of
strength, or power, sufficient for this affair. (O,
K. [In both, in this instance, لِهٰذَا, not بِهٰذَا.])
In the phrase إِذَا كَانَ مُضْطَلِعًا عَلَى حَقِّهِ [If he
be possessed of power, or ability, to obtain his
right, or due], it seems that مضطلعا is made
trans. by means of على because made to imply
the meaning of قَادِرًا or مُقْتَدِرًا. (Mgh.) ↓ مُسْتَضْلِعٌ,
likewise, signifies Having strength, or power.
(TA.)
مُسْتَضْلِعٌ: see what next precedes.
