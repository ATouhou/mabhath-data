masc. when thus called; (S, Msb;) but if called
سِنٌّ, it is fem.: (Msb:) or it is properly masc.;
and if found in poetry made fem., سِنٌّ is meant
thereby: (Zj, Msb:) but As denies its being
made fem.; (Msb, TA;) and as to the saying
ascribed to Dukeyn,
فَفُقِئَتْ عَيْنٌ وَطَنَّتْ ضِرْسُ
[And an eye was put out, and a tooth, or grinder,
sounded], he says that the right reading is وَطَنَّ

her bringing forth, when she defends her young

put in the place of الناقة;) and is a prov., applied

his defending. (Meyd.) And one says, اِتَّقِ النَّاقَةَ
بِجِنِّ ضِرَاسِهَا, meaning (tropical:)  Beware thou of the she-camel in the case of the recentness of her bringing
forth, and of her evil disposition towards him who
approaches her, by reason of her attachment to
her young one. (A, TA.) [In the TA, in art. جن,
this saying is mentioned with ضِرَامِهَا in the place
of ضِرَاسِهَا: the former may perhaps be another
reading; but I rather think that it is a mistranscription for the latter. And in the present
art. in the TA, it is added that Sgh has mentioned (app. in the TS, for he has not done so in
the O,) El-Báhilee's having explained الضِّرَاسُ as
meaning سِيْمٌ لهم; and that it is likewise explained
in the T as meaning سِيْمٌ: but I know no such
word as سِيْمٌ; nor do I know any word of which
it is likely to be a mistranscription, though I have
diligently searched for such. This word سِيْمٌ has
been altered by the copyist in each instance in the
TA; so that it seems to have been indistinctly
written by the author.] ―
