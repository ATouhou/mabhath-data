-b5-  And
الإِضَافَةُ and ↓ التَّضَايُفُ signify Correlation, or
reciprocal relation, so that one of the two cannot
be conceived in the mind without the other; as in
the case of الأُبُوَّةُ and البُنُوَّةُ [i. e. fathership and

-A2-  اضافهُ إِلَيْهِ He
made it to incline towards it; (S, M, * O, Msb,
K; *) namely, a thing (S, O) to a thing. (S, O,
Msb.) He made it to lean, rest, or stay itself,
against it, or upon it. (M, TA.) You say,
اضاف ظَهْرَهُ إِلَى الحَائِطِ He leaned his back against
the wall. (MA.) And اضاف إِلَيْهِ أَمْرًا (tropical:)  He
rested, or stayed, upon him an affair, and desired
him to do what would suffice. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And
He made him to have recourse to it, or to betake
himself to it for refuge. (S, O, K.) ―
-b3-  And He
adjoined it to it. (Msb.) ―
-b4-  And hence الإِضَافَةُ
as a conventional term of the grammarians;
because the first [of two nouns in the case to
which it applies] is adjoined to the second:
(Msb:) [for] إِضَافَةُ الاِسْمِ إِلَى الاِسْمِ is [The prefixing the noun to the noun so that the former
governs the latter in the gen. case] as when you
say غُلَامُ زَيْدٍ; in which instance, غلام is termed
↓ مُضَافٌ, and زيد is termed إِلَيْهِ ↓ مُضَافٌ: and
this is done for the purpose of particularizing or
appropriating, and of making known or definite:
therefore the إِضَافَة of a thing to itself [i. e. the
prefixing a noun in this manner to one identical
therewith in meaning] is not allowable, because a
thing does not make known, or definite, itself;
(S;) unless by an ellipsis, as when you say
حَقُّ اليَقِينِ for حَقُّ الشَّىْءِ اليَقِينِ; or, accord. to
Fr, the Arabs used to do so because of the difference of the two words themselves. (S voce
جَامِعٌ.) [الإِضَافَةُ is also often used as meaning
The state of being prefixed in the manner explained above; or the connection of a noun so
prefixed with its complement. The various kinds
of إِضَافَة are sufficiently explained in the grammars of De Sacy and others: they are not
proper subjects of a lexicon, though much is said
respecting them in the O, and more in the Msb.
―
-b5-  Hence also, بِالإِضَافَةِ إِلَى كَذَا meaning In
comparison with (lit. to), or in relation to, (like
بِالنِّسْبَةِ إِلَى,) such a thing; as though in juxtaposition to it: a phrase of frequent occurrence: see
an ex. in Bd ii. 6.] ―
-b6-  أَضَفْتُهُ (inf. n. إِضَافَةٌ, Msb)
and ↓ ضَيَّفْتُهُ (inf. n. تَضْيِيفٌ, O) both signify the
same, (S, M, O, Msb, K,) from الضِّيَافَةُ; (O;)
i. e. both signify I made him a guest, or lodged
him, or gave him refuge or asylum, syn. أَنْزَلْتُهُ,
(S, M, Msb,) with me, as a ضَيْف [or guest], (S,)
and entertained him: (S, M, Msb:) أَضَافُوهُ and
↓ ضَيَّفُوهُ both signify أَنْزَلُوهُ: (Mgh:) accord. to
Th, أَضَفْتُهُ signifies I lodged him at my abode as
a ضَيْف: and I gave him (i. e. one in fear) protection, or refuge or asylum: (Msb:) and
↓ ضَيَّفْتُهُ is also expl. as meaning I fed him: and
↓ ضيّفهُ as meaning he made him to be in the condition of أَضْيَاف [or guests]. (TA.)

ضَيْفٌ A guest: and guests: (MA:) so called
because adjoined to the family and fed with them:
(Ham p. 124:) it is applied to one, and to a pl.
number, (S, M, MA, O, Msb, K,) and to a male
and to a female, (S, O, Msb, K,) because it is
originally an inf. n.: (MA, Msb:) [as a sing.,]
i. q. ↓ مُضَيَّفٌ, (M,) which is syn. with نَزِيلٌ:
(TA:) and applied to a pl. number, it may be
pl. [or rather a quasi-pl. n.] of ↓ ضَائِفٌ, which is
syn. with نَازِلٌ; thus being of the class of زَوْزٌ
and صَوْمٌ: (M:) and it is also pluralized, having
for its pls. أَضْيَافٌ and ضِيفَانٌ (S, M, MA, O,
Msb, K) and ضُيُوفٌ (S, M, MA, O, K) and ضِيَافٌ,
(MA, TA,) the first of which is properly a pl. of

the vicinage, or quarter, of such a one. (M.)
ضَيْفَنٌ One who comes with a guest: (S, O:)
or who so comes intruding without invitation:
(K:) or one who follows a guest: derived from
ضَيْفٌ, accord. to Sb; but said by AZ to belong
to art. ضفن: (M:) [accord. to J and Sgh] the
ن is augmentative: the pl. is ضَيَافِنُ. (S, O.)

signifying The entertainment of a guest or guests;

دَارُ الضِّيَافَةِ The house of entertainment of guests.]
ضَائِفٌ A man alighting as a guest; syn. نَازِلٌ:
(M, TA:) see ضَيْفٌ: its [proper] pl. is ضُيَّفٌ.

is none other than an adjunct, or adherent].
(TA.) ―

is beset &c.]; and is formed after the manner of
