R. Q. 2
see the preceding paragraph.
ضِحٌّ The sun: (S, O, K:) and (K) the light
of the sun, (Lth, A, O, K,) when it has possession
of the ground: (Lth, O, TA:) or the light of the
sun upon the surface of the ground; sunshine;
contr. of ظِلٌّ: (AHeyth, T, O, TA:) accord. to
AHeyth, originally وِضْحٌ, the و being rejected
and a ح added to the radical ح; but correctly, it is
originally ضِحْىٌ, from ضحيت الشمس [app. a
mistranscription for ضَحِيتُ لِلشَّمْسِ]: (TA; as
from the T:) also land, or ground, that lies open
and exposed (K, TA) to the sun: (TA:) and
what is shone upon, or smitten, by the sun: (K,
TA:) it has no pl. in any of these senses. (ElFihree, TA.) It is said in a trad., لَا يَقْعُدَنَّ
أَحَدُكُمْ بَيْنَ الضِّحِّ وَالظِّلِّ فَإِنَّهُ مَقْعَدُ الشَّيْطَانِ
(S, A) (tropical:)  [None of you shall sit between the sunshine and the shade, for it is the sitting-place of the
devil]; meaning half of him in the sun and half
of him in the shade. (TA.) And one says, جَآءَ
فُلَانٌ بِالضِّحِّ وَالرِّيحِ (tropical:)  Such a one came with, or
brought, that upon which the sun had risen, and
that upon which the wind had blown; (S, K, TA;)
meaning, abundance, or much; (S, A;) or much
property, or many cattle: (TA:) [F asserts that]
one should not say بالضِّيحِ, (K,) i. e. بِالضِّيحِ
وَالرِّيحِ: (TA:) this the vulgar say, but [J
affirms that] it is nought: (S:) several, however, assert that الضِّيح is correct: (MF:) [and
the author of the K, who disallows it in this art.,
authorizes it in art. ضيح, q. v.:] Kr, also, is
related to have said that الضِيحُ signifies “ the
sun ” and “ its light; ” and is said to signify
“ what is exposed to the sun: ” and a poet says,
وَالشَّمْسُ فِى اللُّجَّةِ ذَاتِ الضِّيحِ
[And the sun in the abyss of sunlight]: Aboo-Mis-hal, moreover, mentions, in his “ Nawádir,”
the saying, اُسْتُعْمِلَ فُلَانٌ عَلَى الضِّيحِ وَالرِّيحِ
[meaning (assumed tropical:)  Such a one was employed as manager
of much property]. (TA.) مَاتَ عَنِ الضِّحِّ وَالرِّيحِ,
occurring in a trad., is rendered agreeably with
the explanation of the saying in a trad. mentioned
above, and means (tropical:)  He died leaving much property. (TA.) And it is said of the Prophet, in a
trad., يَكُونُ فِى الضِّحِّ وَالرِّيحِ He will be exposed
to the heat of the sun and the blowing of the winds;
meaning, accord. to Hr, (assumed tropical:)  he will be attended by,
or in the midst of, numerous horsemen and military
forces. (TA.)
ضَحْضَحٌ: see ضَحْضَحَةٌ:
-A2-  and ضَحْضَاحٌ.
ضُحْضُحٌ: see what next follows.
ضَحْضَحَةٌ and ↓ ضَحْضَحٌ and ↓ ضُحْضُحٌ The
running of the سَرَاب [or mirage, along the surface
of the ground, like water: see R. Q. 1]. (K.)
ضَحْضَاحٌ Shallow water; (S, A, TA;) and
hence metaphorically applied in a trad. to (tropical:)  a
shallow part of hell-fire: (TA:) or water little in
quantity; as also ↓ ضَحْضَحٌ: or water reaching
to the ankles: or reaching to the middle of the
skin: or in which there is no being drowned: (K:)
or water little in quantity, in a pool left by a
torrent, &c. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And Many, or much;
in the dial. of Hudheyl; (AA, O, K;) not known
to others: (TA: [see also ضَحْلٌ:]) accord. to
As, it is applied to sheep or goats, and to camels,
as meaning many, or numerous: and also as
meaning scattered, or dispersed, over the surface
of the land, but, notwithstanding, few. (TA.)
