ضَوَّاَ see the next paragraph, in two places. ―
-b2-
One says also, ضَوَّأْتُ عَنْهُ [meaning I brought to
light, made visible, discovered, or revealed, him,
or it]. (M, TA.) A sheep, or goat, belonging
to an Arab of the desert strayed; whereupon he
said, اَللّٰهُمَّ ضَوِّئْ عَنْهُ [O God, bring it to light, or
discover it]. (A, TA.)
-A2-  Accord. to Lth, but
he is the only authority for it known by AM,
(TA,) ضَوَّأَ عَنِ الأَمْرِ, inf. n. تَضْوِئَةٌ, means He
declined, or turned away, from the affair. (K,
TA.)

اضآء, (M, Msb, K,) said of a thing, (M,)
[as, for instance,] of the moon, (Msb,) or اضآءت,
said of fire (النَّار,), (A 'Obeyd, S, O,) inf. n. إِضَآءٌ;
(Msb;) and ↓ ضَآءَ, (M, Msb, K,) or ضَآءَت, (S, O,)
aor. يَضُوْءُ, (M,) or تَضُوْءُ, (S,) inf. n. ضَوْءٌ (S, M,
O, Msb, K) and ضُوْءٌ, (S, O, K,) or the latter is a
simple subst.; (Msb;) but the former verb is
preferred; (TA;) It gave light, was light or
bright, shone, or shone brightly. (Msb, K, * TA.)
[See also an ex. of ↓ the latter verb in a verse
cited voce أُفُقٌ; and cited here in the TA.] And
أَضَأْتُ لَهُ [I gave light to him]. (M.)
-A2-  The
former verb is also trans.: you say, أَضَآءَتْهُ النَّارُ
[The fire made it to be light or bright, to shine, or
to shine brightly]: (S, O:) and أَضَأْتُهُ and ↓ ضَوَّأْتُهُ
[I made it to give light, to be light or bright, to
shine, or to shine brightly]: (M, Msb, * K:) and
أَضَأْتُ بِهِ البَيْتَ and بِهِ ↓ ضَوَّأْتُهُ [I lighted, or
illumined, with it (i. e. with a lamp or the like)
the house, or chamber, or tent]. (M.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,]
اضآء بِبَوْلِهِ (tropical:)  He ejected his urine [so as to make its
drops to glisten]; or emitted it and then stopped
it; syn. حَذَفَ بِهِ; (K, TA;) or خَذَفَ بِهِ;
(so in a copy of the M, as on the authority of
Kr;) or, as in the A, أَذْرَعَ بِهِ. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And
they said مَا أَضْوَأَهُ [How light, or bright, is it!].
(S voce أَظْلَمَ [q. v.].) ―
-b4-  And اضآء signifies also
أَصَابَ ضَوْءًا [He saw (lit. lighted on, or found,)
light, or brightness]. (T voce أَظْلَمَ [q. v.])

تضوّأ He stood in the dark to see people by
the light of their fire, (AZ, K, TA,) without their
seeing him. (AZ, TA.) And تضوّا امْرَأَةً [He
stood in the dark to see a woman by the light of
her fire, without her seeing him]. (TA.)
10
اِسْتَضَأُتُ بِهِ [I sought to obtain light by
means of it; I made use of it for light]. (M, K.)
لَا تَسْتَضِيؤُوا بِنَارِ أَهْلِ الشِّرْكِ [lit. Seek not ye to
obtain light by means of the fire of the people of
belief in a plurality of gods], (O, K,) a saying of
the Prophet, (O,) means (tropical:)  seek not ye counsel, or
advice, of the believers in a plurality of gods, in
affairs: (O, K:) because he whose affair is confused and dubious to him is as though he were in
darkness. (O.)
ضَوْءٌ and ↓ ضُوْءٌ and ↓ ضِيَآءٌ (S, M, O, K) and
↓ ضِوَآءٌ, (M, K,) the last of which is [erroneously]
written in the L ضَوَآءٌ, (TA,) signify the same,
(S, M, O, K,) i. e. Light, syn. نُورٌ, (K, TA,)
accord. to the leading lexicologists; but see what
follows: (TA:) and ضَوْءٌ is an inf. n. of ضَآءَ, (S,
M, O, Msb, K,) and so is ↓ ضُوْءٌ, (S, O, K,) or
this is a simple subst. from ضَآءَ, and so is ↓ ضِيَآءٌ,
which is also, sometimes, written ↓ ضِئَآءٌ, from أَضَآءَ
as syn. with ضَآءَ: (Msb:) the pl. of ضَوْءٌ (M,
TA) and ↓ ضُوْءٌ (M) is أَضْوَآءٌ; and ↓ ضِيَآءٌ is sometimes a pl., (M, TA,) as Zj states it to be: (TA:)
some say that ضَوْءٌ has a more intensive signification than نُورٌ, and that hence God has likened
his direction [the Kur-án] to النُّور rather than to
الضَّوْء; because if it were otherwise, no one had
erred: and that hence, also, [in the Kur x. 5,]
the sun is termed ↓ ضِيَآء; and the moon, نُورٌ: it
is also said that ضَوْءٌ signifies the rays that are
diffused by what is termed نُورٌ: the kádee Zekereeyà affirms that these two words are syn. by
their original application, but that ضَوْءٌ is more
forcible accord. to usage: and some say that
الضَّوْءُ signifies that [light] which subsists by itself,
as [that of] the sun, and fire; and النُّورُ, to that
which subsists by some other thing [as does the
light of the moon]. (MF, TA.)
