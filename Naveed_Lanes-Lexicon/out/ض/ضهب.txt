ضهب1
ضَهَبَهُ بِالنَّارِ, aor.
ضَهَبَ, (K,) inf. n. ضَهْبٌ, (TK,)
He altered it, (K, TA,) and changed its colour,

-A2-  ضَهَبَ said of a man, (O, K,) aor.
ضَهَبَ, (TA,)
inf. n. ضُهُوبٌ, (O, K,) (tropical:)  He failed of fulfilling
his promise (أَخْلَفَ), and was weak, and not like
a man: (O, K, TA:) as though likened to meat

-b2-  And
ضَهْبُ القَوْمِ signifies اِخْتِلَاطُهُمْ [i. e. The people's
being mixed, or confused]: (JK, O:) or أَخْلَاطُهُمْ
[i. e. ↓ ضَهْبٌ is a subst., signifying a medley, or
mixed or promiscuous multitude or collection, of
people]. (So in the K. [But I think that this
explanation is a mistranscription.]) [Or it signifies The people's multiplying themselves, and hastening: for] it is said in the “ Nawádir ” that هَضَبَ
القَوْمُ and ضَهَبُوا and هُلَبُوا and أُنَبُوا and حُطَّبُوا all
denote الإِكْثَار and الإِسْرَاع: so in the T in art.
هضب. (TA.)

(K,) inf. n. as above, (S, O,) He exposed a bow,
(S, O, K,) and a spear, (S, O,) to the fire, (S, O,
K,) on the occasion of straightening it, (S, O,) or
to straighten it. (K.) [See also 1.] ―
-b3-  And He
collected together the fire; (JK;) and so ↓ ضَهْضَبَ.
(JK, O, K.)

مُضَاهَبَةٌ signifies Mutual reviling or vilifying; (K;) the addressing each other with bad
words. (TA.)
Q. 1
ضَهْضَبَ: see 2, last sentence. [Mentioned in this art., as though Q. Q., contr. to the
rule generally observed with respect to words of
four radical letters of which the first and third are
identical but not the second and fourth.]
ضَهْبٌ: see the first paragraph.
قَوْسٌ ضَهْبَآءُ A bow upon which the fire has taken
effect [so as to alter its colour]: (O, K:) like
ضَبْحَآءُ. (TA.)
ضَيْهَبٌ i. q. صَيْهَبٌ, meaning A place where flesh-meat is roasted [on the ground heated by the sun];
(K; [in the CK, لِمَشْوِىِّ اللّحمِ is erroneously
put for لِمَشْوَى اللَّحْمِ;]) accord. to Lth, any [high
ground such as is called] قُفّ, or rugged ground,
or place on a mountain, upon which the sun shines
with such heat that flesh-meat will roast upon it:
but Az says that what Lth means is صَيْهَبٌ only,
with the unpointed ص; (O, * TA;) and if so, the
meaning assigned here in the K is not correct.
(TA.)
مُضَهَّبٌ Flesh-meat roasted, but not thoroughly
cooked: (S, A, O:) accord. to El-Mufaddal, flesh-meat cut in pieces; (O;) and thus in the K;
(TA;) but IF says that this is nought, unless it
be cut in pieces roasted: (O:) it is at variance
with what is said by the leading authorities, for
they say that it means flesh-meat roasted upon
heated stones: or roasted upon the fire, but not
thoroughly cooked: (TA:) or cooked in a fryingpan. (TA in art. عرص.) Imra-el-Keys says,
نَمُشُّ بِأَعْرَافِ الجِيَادِ أَكُفَّنَا
إِذَا نَحْنُ قُمْنَا عَنْ شِوَآءٍ مُضَهَّبِ
[We wipe our hands with the manes of the swift
horses when we rise from eating roast meat not
thoroughly cooked]. (S, O.)
