ضَعِيف [i. e. weak, &c.]; (O, K;) and so ↓ استضعفهُ,
(S, O, Msb, K,) and ↓ تضعّفهُ: (O, K:) or ↓ استضعفهُ
signifies he found him to be so; (TA;) or he
asserted him to be (جَعَلَهُ) so; (Msb;) or, as also
↓ تضعّفهُ, he [esteemed him to be so, and therefore]
behaved proudly, haughtily, or insolently, towards
him, in respect of worldly things, because of [his]
poverty, and meanness of condition. (IAth, TA.)

ضاعفهُ, (S, O, K,) inf. n. مُضَاعَفَةٌ; (S, Msb;)
and ↓ ضعّفهُ, (S K,) inf. n. تَضْعِيفٌ; (S, O, Msb;)
and ↓ اضعفهُ, (S, O, K,) inf. n. إِضْعَافٌ; (S, Msb;)
all signify the same; (S, K;) i. e. He doubled it,
or made it double, or two-fold; (O, K;) [and
trebled it, or made it treble, or three-fold; and
redoubled it, or made it several-fold, or manyfold; i. e. multiplied it; for] Kh says, التَّضْعِيفُ
signifies the adding to a thing so as to make it
double, or two-fold; or more [i. e. treble, or threefold; and several-fold, or many-fold]; (S, O,
Msb;) and so الإِضْعَافُ, and المُضَاعَفَةُ; (S, Msb;)
and ↓ ضَعَفَهُ, without teshdeed, signifies the same
as ضاعفهُ. (Ham p. 257.) The saying, in the
Kur [xxxiii. 30], يُضَاعَفْ لَهَا العَذَابُ ضِعْفَيْنِ,
(Mgh, O, K,) in which AA read ↓ يُضَعَّفْ, (TA,)
accord. to AO, (Mgh, O,) means, The punishment shall be made to her three punishments;
(Mgh, O, K;) for, he says, she is to be punished
once; and when the punishment is doubled twofold, [or is repeated twice,] the one becomes
three: (TA:) he adds, (O,) and the tropical
meaning of يُضَاعَفْ (مَجَازُ يُضَاعَفْ [for which
مَجازٌ يُضَاعَفُ is erroneously put in the CK]) is
two things' being added to a thing so that it
becomes three: (O, K:) but Az disapproves this,
saying that it is peculiar to the tropical and the
common conventional speech, whereas the skilled
grammarians state the meaning to be, she shall be
punished with twice the like of the punishment of
another; (Mgh;) [so that it may be rendered the
punishment shall be doubled to her, made two-fold;
and in like manner] Ibn-'Arafeh explains it as
meaning she shall have two shares of punishment.
(O.) فَيُضَاعِفُهُ لَهُ أَضْعَافًا كَثِيرَةً [And He will multiply it to him many-fold, or, as some read, فَيُضَاعِفَهُ
that He may multiply it,] is another phrase
occurring in the Kur [ii. 246]. (O, TA.) And
one says, الثَّوَابَ لِلْقَوْمِ ↓ أَضْعَفْتُ [I doubled, or
multiplied, the recompense to the people, or party].
(Msb.) And القَوْمُ ↓ أُضْعِفَ The people, or party,
had a doubling, or multiplying, [of their recompense, &c.,] made to them; (Msb;) [and so,
app., أَضْعَفُوا; (see مُضْعِفٌ;)] i. q. ضُوعِفَ لَهُمْ.
(S, O, K.)
4
اضعفهُ He, (God, Msb, or another, S,) or
it, (disease, TA,) rendered him ضَعِيف [i. e. weak,
&c.]; (S, O, Msb, K;) as also ↓ ضعّفهُ. (L, TA.)
-A2-  And أَضْعَفَ, said of a man, He became one
whose beast was weak. (S, O, K.)

ضَعْفٌ an inf. n. of 1, like ↓ ضُعْفٌ, (S, *  O, *
Msb, K,) [both, when used as simple substs.,
signifying Weakness, feebleness, &c.,] but some
say that the former is in the judgment or opinion,
and the latter in the body; (O, Msb, K;) and
↓ ضَعَفٌ signifies the same, (IAar, K, TA,) and is
in the body and also in the judgment or opinion
and the intellect. (TA.) ―
-b2-  ضَعْفُ التَّأْلِيفِ [Weakness of construction, in language,] is such a construction of the members of a sentence as is contrary to the [generally approved] rules of syntax;
as when a pronoun is introduced before its noun
with respect to the actual order of the words and
the order of the sense [in a case in which the
pronoun is affixed to the agent in a verbal proposition]; for instance, in the phrase, ضَرَبَ غُلَامُهُ
زَيْدًا [“ His,” i. e. Zeyd's, “young man beat
Zeyd ”]. (KT.) When the pronoun is affixed to
the objective complement, as in خَافَ رَبَّهُ عُمَرُ
[“ 'Omar feared his Lord ”] such introduction of
it is common: (I'Ak p. 128:) and it is [universally] allowable when the pronoun is of the
kind called ضَمِيرُ الشَّأْنِ, as in إِنَّهُ زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ; or
ضَمِيرُ رُبَّ, as in رُبَّهُ رَجُلًا لَقِيتُهُ; or ضَمِيرُ نِعْمَ, as
in نِعْمَهُ رَجُلًا زَيْدٌ. (Kull p. 56.) ―
-b3-  [In the CK,
a signification belonging to ضُعْف is assigned to
ضَعْف.]
ضُعْفٌ: see ضَعْفٌ. ―
-b2-  مِنْ ضُعْفٍ in the Kur
xxx. 53 means Of sperm. (O, K, TA.) AA,
reciting before the Prophet, said مِنْ ضَعْفٍ; and
was told by the latter to say من ضُعْفٍ, [i. e.]
with damm. (TA.)
ضِعْفُ الشَّىْءِ signifies The like of the thing,
(AO, Zj, S, O, Msb, K, TA,) that doubles it
(يُضْعِفُهُ); (Zj, TA;) and ضِعْفَاهُ, twice the like of
it; (AO, S, O, Msb, K;) and أَضْعَافُهُ, the likes of
it: (S, Msb:) الضِّعْفُ in the [proper] language
of the Arabs means the like: this is the original
signification: (Az, Msb:) and (K, TA, but in
CK “ or,”) then, by a later [and conventional]
usage, (Az, Msb,) the like and more, the addition
being unlimited: (Az, Msb, K:) one says, هٰذَا
ضِعْفُ هٰذَا i. e. This is the like of this: and هٰذَانِ
ضِعْفَاهُ i. e. These two are twice the like of it: and
it is allowable in the language of the Arabs to
say, هٰذَا ضِعْفُهُ meaning This is twice the like [i. e.
the double] of it, and thrice the like [i. e. the treble]
of it, [and more,] because the ضِعْف is an unlimited addition: (Az, Msb: [and the like is
said in the O, on the authority of Az:]) and one
says, لَكَ ضِعْفُهُ meaning Thou shalt have twice the
like of it, (Zj, O, K,) using the sing. form, though
the dual form is better, (Zj, O,) and meaning also
thrice the like of it, and more without limit: (K:)
and الاِثْنَانِ ضِعْفُ الوَاحِدِ [i. e. الاثنان is the double
of الواحد]: (M and K in art. ثنى:) and if one say
in his will, أَعْطُوهُ ضِعْفَ نَصِيبِ وَلَدِى, twice the
like of the share of his child is given to him; and
if he say ضِعْفَيْهِ, thrice the like thereof is given
to him; so that if the share of the son be a
hundred, he [the legatee] is given two hundred
in the former case, and three hundred in the latter
case; for the will is made to accord with the
common conventional language, not with the
niceties of the [proper] language: (Az, Msb: [and
the like is said, but less fully, in the Mgh:]) the
pl. is أَضْعَافٌ only. (TA.) إِذًا لَأَذَقْنَاكَ ضِعْفَ
الحَيَاةِ وَضِعْفَ المَمَاتِ, in the Kur [xvii. 77], means
ضِعْفَ العَذَابِ حَيًّا وَمَيِّتًا, (S,) or ضِعْفَ عَذَابِ
الحَيَاةِ وَضِعْفَ عَذَابِ المُمَاتِ, (O, Jel,) i. e. [In
that case we would assuredly have made thee to
taste] the like [or, as some explain it, the double]
of the punishment of others in the present world
and [the like or the double thereof] in the world to
come: (Jel:) [Sgh adds, app. on the authority
of Ibn-'Arafeh,] the meaning is, the punishment
of others should be made two-fold, or more,
(يُضَاعَف,) to thee, because thou art a prophet.
(O.) In the saying, فَأُولَائِكَ لَهُمْ جَزَآءُ الضِّعْفِ
بِمَا عَمِلُوا, in the Kur [xxxiv. 36], by الضِّعْفِ is
meant الأضْعَافِ [i. e. For these shall be the recompense of the likes for what they have done];
and it is most properly held to denote ten of the
likes thereof, because of the saying in the Kur
[vi. 161], “Whoso doth that which is good, for
him shall be ten of the likes thereof. ” (O.) In
the saying, فَآتِهِمْ عَذَابًا ضِعْفًا, in the Kur [vii. 36],
by ضِعْفًا is meant مُضَاعَفًا [i. e. Therefore do Thou
recompense them with a doubled, or a double,
punishment]: عَذَابٌ ضِعْفٌ meaning a punishment
as though doubled, one part of it upon another.

entry of a note or postil or the like, or entries of
notes &c., in the interspaces of the lines, &c., of
his writing, or book]: (S, O, TA:) and ↓ تَضَاعِيفُ
