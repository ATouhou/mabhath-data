it; syn. شَاكَلَهُ; (S, Msb, K;) like ضَاهَأَهُ [q. v.]:

(Msb, TA. *) It is said in a trad., أَشَدُّ النَّاسِ
عَذَابًا يَوْمَ القِيَامَةِ الَّذِين يُضَاهُونَ خَلْقَ اللّٰهِ i. e.

ضَهْيًا: see the next paragraph, in four places.
ضَهْيَآءُ A woman that does not menstruate: pl.
ضُهْىٌ; which necessarily implies that the former
is [as above, i. e.] with the long ا: but AA mentions ↓ ضَهْيَاةٌ and ↓ ضَهْيَاهٌ, with ة and with ه, as
having this meaning; which necessarily implies
that ضهيا is with the short ا [i. e., accord. to a
general rule, ↓ ضَهْيًا, with tenween, like ضَهْيَأٌ,
q. v. in art. ضهيأ, though (accord. to a general
rule) this should be regarded as a masc. epithet]:
(S) or ضَهْيَآءُ, and also with the short ا [app.
↓ ضَهْيًا, as above, not ضَهْيَا, or, as I rather incline
to think, ضَهْيَأٌ (which is mentioned in art. ضهيأ)
may be here meant], signify a woman that does
not menstruate nor become pregnant; (K, TA;)
so that she is as though she resembled a man:
(TA: [see 3:]) or that menstruates but does not
become pregnant: (K, TA:) or that does not
bring forth, though she menstruate: (TA:) or
whose breasts do not grow forth; (K, TA;) and
when this is the case, she does not menstruate:
or the former signifies that does not menstruate,
being pregnant. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And (assumed tropical:)  Land that does
not give growth to anything; as also with the
short ا [i. e. ↓ ضَهْيًا or ضَهْيَأٌ]. (K. [In the TA
this meaning is restricted, app. without reason, to
the form with the short ا.])
-A2-  Also, (S, K,) and
with the short ا [i. e. ↓ ضَهْيًا or ضَهْيَأٌ], (K,) A
species of tree (S, K) of the kind called عِضَاه, (K,)
having a بَرَمَة [q. v.] and a pod (عُلَّفَة) [which
succeeds the بَرَمَة], and many thorns. (TA. [For
further descriptions thereof, see ضَهْيَأٌ, in art.
ضهيأ.])
ضَهْيَاةٌ and ضَهْيَاهٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
ضَهِىٌّ, (S, K,) of the measure فَعِيلٌ, (S,) The
like of another [thing or person]: (S, K:) one
says, هٰذَا ضَهِىُّ هٰذَا This is the like of this: (S:)
or هُوَ ضَهِيُّكَ He is the like of thee. (K.)
