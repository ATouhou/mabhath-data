and both accord. to AA: (S, O:) the former
signifies the offspring of anything: (TA:) and
also, (K, TA, [in a copy of the M ↓ the latter,
but this is app. a mistranscription,]) multitude of

in the sitting-place of necessity, &c.; meaning he
was, or became, in an abject condition]: the
phrase denotes disdain, or scorn; and is thought
by AM to be from اِضْطَنَأَ meaning “ he was
abashed, &c. ” (TA.)
