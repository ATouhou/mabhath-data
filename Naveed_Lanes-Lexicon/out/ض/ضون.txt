تَضَوَّنَ see the preceding paragraph.
ضَوْنٌ The إِنْفَحَة [i. e. runnet, or runnet-bag, of
a hid, or lamb]. (K.)
ضَانَةٌ A nose-ring of brass (بُرَةٌ M, K, مِنْ صُفْرٍ
M) for a camel: (K:) or a [camel's nose-ring
such as is termed] خِزَامَة; accord. to Sh: mentioned in the K in art. ضأن; but this is its
proper place, for it is without. (TA.)
ضَوْنَةٌ A young female child. (K, TA. [In
the CK, الظَّبْيَةُ is put for الصَّبِيَّةُ.])
ضَيْوَنٌ, (S, M, K,) of the measure فَيْعَلٌ, not
فَعْوَلٌ, because the former is the more common,
(IB, TA,) extr. [in respect of rule], preserving
its original form, (M,) without إِدْغَام [i. e. not
having its و incorporated into the ى so as to
become ضَيَّنٌ, as it should by rule,] because it is
a primitive noun, (S,) like حَيْوَةُ, which is a
proper name of a man, (S, M,) but more extr.
because that is allowable in a proper name which
is not allowable in another kind of word, (M,)
[A he-cat;] i. q. سِنَّوْرٌ [q. v.]; (M:) the male
سِنَّوْر: (S, K:) or a certain small beast resembling
the سِنَّوْر: (M:) pl. ضَيَاوِنُ, (S, K,) in which the
و is unaltered because it is so in the sing.: (S,
TA:) Sb says, the dim. is ↓ ضُيَيِّنٌ, like أُسَيِّدٌ
[dim. of أَسْوَدُ], but he who says أُسَيْوِدٌ may say
↓ ضُيَيْوِنٌ. (S.)
ضُيَيِّنٌ and ضُيَيْوِنٌ: see what next precedes.
