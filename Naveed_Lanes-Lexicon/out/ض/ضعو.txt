ضعو1
ضَعَا He hid, or concealed, himself. (ISd, K.)
ضَعَةٌ, (S, K,) originally ضَعْوٌ, or ضَعَوٌ, (accord.
to different copies of the S,) the ة being a substitute [for the و], because of the form of its pl. [and
of the rel. n.]; or, as some say, the ة is a substitute for an initial و, and it is mentioned also in
art. وضع; (S;) A species of tree, (S, K, TA,) in
the desert: or it is [a plant] like the [species of
panic grass called] ثُمَام: (TA:) accord. to Az,
a species of ثُمَام: (TA in art. ثم:) or another
plant: and some pronounce it ضِعَةٌ; but this is
in الحَسَب [or grounds of pretension to respect
&c.], and does not belong to the present art.:
(TA:) the pl. is ضَعَوَاتٌ. (S, TA.) [Golius says,
on the authority of Meyd, that it also signifies
The reed of which writing-reeds are made.]
ضَعَوِىٌّ Of, or relating to, the ضَعَة above mentioned. (S, K.)
