ضجع1
ضَجَعَ, aor.
ضَجَعَ, inf. n. ضَجْعٌ and ضُجُوعٌ, [He
lay upon his side; or] he laid his side upon the
ground; [and simply he lay; and he slept;] as
also ↓ اِضْطَجَعَ, (S, Msb, K, TA,) which is also
expl. as syn. with نَامَ, [which has the second and
third of the meanings mentioned above,] and with
اِسْتَلْقَى, [which has the third of those meanings,]
(TA,) the ط being substituted for the ت of اِضْتَجَعَ,
(Lth, S, Msb,) and ↓ اِضَّجَعَ, (S, Msb, K,) and
↓ اِلْطَجَعَ, (S, L, K, in the CK [erroneously]
اطَّجَعَ,) the ض in اضطجع being changed into ل,
which is the letter nearest in sound thereto,
because the combination of two such letters as ض
and ط is disliked, (S, L,) the same change occurring in اِلْطِرَادٌ for اِضْطِرَادٌ, (Az, TA,) though this
change is anomalous; (L;) and ↓ أَضْجَعَ likewise
signifies the same as ضَجَعَ; (Msb;) [and] so does
↓ انضجع, (K, TA,) as quasi-pass. of the trans.
verb اضجع. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [And accord. to Freytag,
it occurs in the Deewán of the Hudhalees as signifying He declined from the way.] ―

النَّجْمُ means (tropical:)  [The star, or asterism, or the

is a dial. var. of ↓ ضجّعت, (TA,) which means
(tropical:)  The sun approached the setting; (S, K, TA;)
like ضَرَّعَت. (S, TA.) ―
-b4-  ضَجَعَ فِى أَمْرِهِ (tropical:)  He
was, or became, weak in his affair; as also
↓ اضجع; and so ضَجِعَ, like فَرِحَ [in measure],
on the authority of IKtt. (TA. [See also 2,
and 5, and 6.]) And ضُجِعَ فِى رَأْيِهِ [not a mistranscription for ضَجِعَ, as is shown by its part. n.,
q. v.,] (tropical:)  He was, or became, weak in his judgment,
or opinion. (TA.)

namely, his girl, or young woman, (TA,) in, or

side upon the ground. (K.) ―
