pantingly, or hard, with a sound from the chest;
or] made the breathing to be heard when running:
(S, O:) [or breathed laboriously, when fatigued;
and in like manner one says of camels; for] ضَبْحٌ
signifies the breathing of horses and of camels
when fatigued: (Suh, TA:) or caused a sound to
be heard from their mouths, different from neighing, and from the sound termed حَمْحَمَةٌ, (K,
TA,) in their running: (TA:) [or it signifies also
the horses neighed; for it is said that] الضُّبَاحُ is
also syn. with الصَّهِيلُ: (TA:) or, [but probably
only with the former of the two inf. ns. mentioned
above,] ran a pace less quick than that which is
termed تَقْرِيب: (K, TA:) or i. q. ضَبَعَت, (AO,
S, O, TA,) which means they stretched forth their
arms, (AO, TA,) going along, (AO, S, * O, TA,)
or running: (AO, TA:) accord. to I'Ab, one
does not say ضَبَحَتْ دَابَّةٌ except in speaking of a
dog or a horse: [he app. means that this verb is
used thus only as denoting the uttering of a sound,
or a manner of breathing:] some of the lexicologists say that those who use it in relation to a
camel make ضَبْحٌ to have the meaning of ضَبْعٌ.
