ضحك1
ضَحِكَ, (S, MA, O, Msb, K, &c.,) and some
say ضِحِكْتُ, with kesr to the ض, (TA, as from
the K, [but not in the CK nor in my MS. copy
of the K,]) to agree with the vowel of the ح
because the latter is a faucial letter, and this is
a correct dial. var. of which similar instances
are mentioned, and ضَحَكَ also is said to be a
well known dial. var. of ضَحِكَ, (TA,) aor.
ضَحَكَ,
(S. O,) inf. n. ضَحِكٌ and ضِحْكٌ (S, MA, O, Msb,
K, KL) and ضَحْكٌ, (S, MA, O, K, KL,) the first
of which is the superior form, (IDrd, O,) [the
second and third being contractions thereof,] and
ضِحِكٌ, (S, O, K, KL,) and if you said ضَحَكٌ it
would be agreeable with analogy, (Az, TA,) He
laughed; (MA, KL, PS, TK;) contr. of بَكَى:
(TK:) [see also 6:] الضَّحِكُ is well known, as
meaning the expanding of the face, and displaying
of the teeth, by reason of happiness, joy, or
gladness; and التَّبَسُّمُ is the beginning thereof: thus
in the Towsheeh and other works: (MF, TA:)
and in like manner in the Mufradát [of Er-Rághib]; in which it is added that it is also
used as meaning simply the being happy, joyful,
or glad: and sometimes as meaning simply the
wondering [at a thing]; and this is the meaning
intended by him who says that it is peculiar to
man: (TA:) [i. e.] ضَحِكَ, said of a man, signifies also he wondered; syn. عَجِبَ; (O, K, TA;)
with مِنْ preposed to the object of wonder: (TA:) or
he was frightened; or he feared. (K, TA.) You say,
ضَحِكَ مِنْهُ and بِهِ, both meaning the same, (S,
O, Msb,) i. e. He laughed at him; derided him;
or ridiculed him: or he wondered at him. (Msb.)
And ضَحِكَ إِلَيْهِ [He behaved laughingly, or
cheerfully, towards him]. (IDrd and K in art.
بش [See بَشَّ لَهُ.]) ―
-b2-  Said of an ape, He
uttered a cry or cries: (K:) or one says of
the ape when he utters a cry or cries, يَضْحَكُ,
(S, TA,) meaning he displays his teeth, or grins.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  And ضَحِكَ السَّحَابُ (tropical:)  The clouds lightened. (S, O, K, TA.) Hence the usage of the
verb in a trad. cited voce تَحَدَّثَ. (O, TA.) ―
-b4-
And ضَحِكَ الغَدِيرُ i. e. (tropical:)  [The pool of water left
by a torrent] glistened by reason of its fulness.
(TA.) ―
-b5-  [And ضَحِكَ ثَغْرُهُ (assumed tropical:)  His front teeth,
or his teeth, glistened by reason of his laughing;
meaning he laughed so as to show his front teeth,
or his teeth.] ―
-b6-  And ضَحِكَ الزَّهْرُ (tropical:)  The flowers
[looked gay, or] were as though they were laughing.
(TA.) And ضَحِكَتِ الأَرْضُ (tropical:)  The earth, or land,
put forth its plants, or herbage, and its flowers.
(TA.) And ضَحِكَتِ الرِّيَاضُ عَنِ الأَزْهَارِ (tropical:)  The
meadows, or gardens, displayed the flowers. (TA.)
―
-b7-  And ضَحِكَتِ النَّخْلَةُ (tropical:)  The palm-tree put forth
[or disclosed] its ضَحْك; as also ↓ أَضْحَكَت; (TA;)
[i. e.] the spathe of the palm-tree, (Skr, O, TA,)
that covered the طَلْع [or spadix], (O,) burst
open. (Skr, O, TA.) And ضَحِكَ الطَّلْعُ (tropical:)  The
طلع [here app. meaning the spathe of the
palm-tree] split, or clave, open; and so تَبَسَّمَ.
(TA.) ―
-b8-  And, as some assert, (ISd, TA,)
ضَحِكَتْ signifies also (tropical:)  She menstruated; said
of a hare; (ISd, Z, O, Msb, TA;) accord. to
some, from the ضَحَّاك [meaning the interior]
of the طَلْعَة [of the palm-tree] when it bursts
open; (ISd, TA;) and hence, (K, TA,) said
also in this sense of a woman, (O, Msb, K,
TA,) accord. to Mujáhid, (O, TA,) and some
others, (TA,) in the Kur xi. 74, (O, K, TA,)
where some read فَضَحَكَتْ, which is said to be
a well-known dial. var.; (TA;) and likewise,
accord. to some, said in this sense of the hyena,
(O, TA,) when she sees blood, or as IAar says,
when she eats the flesh of men and drinks their
blood: (TA:) [it is commonly asserted by the
Arabs that] the hare menstruates like women:
(Kzw:) but with respect to this meaning as
assigned to the verb in the Kur xi. 74, Fr
says that he had not heard it from any person
deserving of confidence; (O, TA; *) and Zj says
that it is nought: both say that the meaning
there is, she laughed by reason of happiness:
(TA:) and some say that there is an inversion
in this case, what is meant being فَبَشَّرْنَاهَا بِإِسْحٰقَ
فَضَحِكَتْ: (Fr, O, TA:) or the meaning is, she
wondered; so says I'Ab; and so Er-Rághib,
who adds that it is confirmed by her saying,
“ shall I bring forth a child when I am an
old woman, and this my husband is an old man?
verily this is indeed a wonderful thing: ” and that
فَحَاضَتْ which is inserted by some of the expositors
after فَضَحِكَتْ is not an explanation of this expression, as some of them have imagined it to be, but
is the mention of [a fact which was] a sign that
the announcement was not that of an event
improbable: or the meaning is, she was frightened; so says Fr.: (TA:) and with respect to
the meaning of this verb when said of the hyena,
mentioned above, it is rejected by AHát and
others: (TA:) IDrd says, on the authority of
AHát, respecting the following verse of TaäbbataSharrà,
تَضْحَكُ الضَّبْعُ لِقَتْلَى هُذَيْلٍ
وَتَرَى الذِّئْبَ لَهَا يَسْتَهِلُّ
that the meaning is (assumed tropical:)  The hyena displays her
teeth, or grins, on account of the slain [of
Hudheyl], when she sees them, like as they
say of the ass when he plucks out the [plant
called] صِلِّيَانَة; (O, TA;) or, as others say,
(assumed tropical:)  the hyena snarls, displaying her teeth; and
sees the wolf raising his voice in calling the
[other] wolves to them, i. e. to the slain: (O,
TA:*) Abu-l-' Abbás says that the meaning is,
(assumed tropical:)  the hyena displays her teeth, because the wolf
contends with her over the slain: and some say
that the poet means, (assumed tropical:)  the hyena rejoices because
of the slain. (TA.) ―
-b9-  One says also, ضَحِكَتِ
السَّمُرَةُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  The سمرة [or gum-acacia-tree]
flowed with its gum: from ضحكت meaning
“ she menstruated. ” (Bd in xi. 74.)
3
مُضَاحَكَةٌ [inf. n. of ضاحكهُ] signifies [The
contending, or vying, in laughing, with another;
or the laughing with another; or] the laughing

-b2-  [Hence,] one says, النَّوْرُ
يُضَاحِكُ الشَّمْسَ (assumed tropical:)  [The flowers vie in brightness
with the sun]. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And إِنَّ رَأْيَكَ لَيُضَاحِكُ
المُشْكِلَاتِ (tropical:)  [Verily thy judgment makes sport with
ambiguities]; said to him to whom confused and
dubious things are apparent and known. (TA.)
4
اضحكهُ, (S, O, K,) inf. n. إِضْحَاكٌ, (KL,)
said of God, (S, O,) or of a man, (K,) He
made him, or caused him, to laugh. (S, *  O, *
K, * KL, PS.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] اضحك الضَّبُعَ, said
of blood, (TA,) or of the sword, (O, TA,)
(assumed tropical:)  [It made the hyena to display her teeth; or
to snarl, displaying her teeth: or to rejoice:
(see 1, latter part:) but explained as meaning]
(tropical:)  it made the hyena to menstruate. (TA.) ―
