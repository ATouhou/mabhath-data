ضل1
ضَلَلْتُ, (S, Mgh, * O, Msb, * K,) third pers.
ضَلَّ, (Mgh, Msb,) aor.
ضَلِ3َ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,)
inf. n. ضَلَالٌ and ضَلَالَةٌ; (S, * O, * Msb;) and
ضَلِلْتُ, (S, Mgh, * O, Msb, * K,) third pers. as
above; (Mgh;) the former of the dial. of Nejd,
and the more chaste; the latter of the dial. of the
people of El-'Áliyeh, (S, Msb, TA,) and of El-
Hijáz, and Kr has mentioned ضِلِلْتُ for ضَلِلْتُ as
heard from the tribe of Temeem; (TA;) I erred,
strayed, or went astray; (Mgh, Msb;) deviated
from the right way or course, or from that which
was right; missed, or lost, the right way; or lost
my way; ضَلَالٌ and ضَلَالَةٌ signifying the contr.
of رَشَادٌ, (S, O, TA,) and هُدًى. (K, TA.) [See
ضَلَالٌ below.] Hence, in the Kur [xxxiv. 49],
قُلْ إِنْ ضَلَلْتُ فِإِنَّمَا أَضِلُّ عَلَى نَفْسِى [Say thou, If
I err, I shall err only against myself, i. e., to my
own hurt]. (O, Msb. [See also x. 108 and xvii.
16 of the Kur.]) One says also, ضَلَّ ضَلَالُهُ [app.
His error became error indeed; a phrase similar
to جَدَّ جِدُّهُ, q. v.: or his erring passed away;
see 4, latter part]. (TA.) And ضَلَّ عَنِ القَصْدِ
He deviated from the right way or course. (TA.)
And the verb is trans. as well as intrans.: you
say, ضَلَّ الطَّرِيقَ, and ضَلَّ عَنْهُ, aor.
ضَلِ3َ and
ضَلَ3َ,
(Mgh, Msb,) inf. ns. as above, meaning He erred,
strayed, or went astray, from the road, or way;
(Msb;) he did not find the way to the road:
(Mgh, Msb:) and of anything stationary, if you
miss the place thereof, you say ضَلَلْتُهُ and ضَلِلْتُهُ:
(Az, Msb:) or you say, ضَلِلْتُ الطَّرِيقَ, (K,) or
ضَلِلْتُ المَسْجِدَ, and الدَّارَ, (ISk, S, O,) [I missed,
or lost, the right way to the road, or the mosque,
and the house,] when you know not the place
thereof: (ISk, S, O:) and in like manner, anything stationary, to which one does not find the
way: (ISk, S, O, K:) and AA says the like:
but that one says of a thing that falls from his
hand, and a thing that quits its place, ↓ أَضْلَلْتُهُ,
(IB, TA,) which means I lost it, and knew not
its place; meaning, for instance, a horse, or she-camel, or the like: (Az, Msb:) [thus] one says,
أَضْلَلْتُ بِعِيرِى [I lost my camel, and knew not
his place,] (AA, ISk, S, IB, O) when his shank
has been tied up to his arm and one does not find
the way to him, and when he has been left loose
and has gone away whither one knows not: (AA,
IB, TA:) but Yoo differs from others respecting
this case; for, accord. to him, one says, اضلّ
فُلَانٌ بَعِيرَهُ and also ضَلَّهُ, in the same sense; (O,
TA;) and the like is said in the K: (TA:) and
it is also said in the Bári' that when you seek an
animal and miss its place and find not the way to
it, it is regarded as in the category of stationary
things, and therefore you say ضَلِلْتُهُ. (Msb.) ―
-b2-
ضَلَّ signifies also He was, or became, confounded,
or perplexed, and unable to see his right course.
(Ibn-Es-Seed, TA.) ―
-b3-  Also, aor.
ضَلِ3َ (S, O, K) and
ضَلَ3َ, (K,) the pret. being like زَلَّ and مَلَّ, (TA,)
inf. n. ضَلَال, It (a thing, S, O, TA) became lost;
[as though it went astray;] it perished, came to
nought, or passed away. (S, O, K, TA.) Thus in
the phrase ضَلَّ عَنِّى كَذَا Such a thing became
lost from me. (Mgh.) One says to him from whom
pieces of money have dropped, قَدْ ضَلَّتْ عَنْكَ
[They have become lost from thee]. (TA.) And to
him who has done a deed from which no profit
has resulted, you say, قَد ضَلَّ سَعْيُكَ (tropical:)  [Thy labour
has been lost]: the like occurs in the Kur xviii. 104,
meaning ضَاعَ. (TA, in two places.) ―
-b4-  And (tropical:)  He
(a man, TA) died, and became dust and bones.
(K, TA.) In this sense the verb is used in the
Kur xxxii. 9: but some there read, in the place
of ضَلَلْنَا, صَلِلْنَا [q. v.], with ص: (TA:) or the
verb in that instance has the meaning here next
following. (S.) ―
-b5-  And (assumed tropical:)  He, or it, (a man, S,
TA, or a camel, Msb, and a thing, TA,) was, or
became, unperceived or imperceptible, unapparent,
latent, hidden or concealed, or absent, (S, Msb,
K, TA.) Hence the phrase, ضَلَّ المَآءُ فِى اللَّبَنِ
(tropical:)  [The water became unperceived, or concealed, in
the milk]. (TA.) One says of a road to which
he has not been able to find the way, ضَلَّ عَنِّى
[It has become hidden from me]. (K, TA.) And
hence also the saying of a man, as is related in a
trad., (S, O, TA,) after his having charged his
sons by saying to them, “When I die, burn ye
me; and when I shall have become ashes, pound
me; then scatter me in the water: ” (O, TA:)
لَعَلِّى أَضِلُّ اللّٰه (S, O, TA) i. e. (assumed tropical:)  May-be, I shall
be unperceived by God, or concealed from Him:
(S:) or may-be, I shall be hidden, or absent, from
God's punishment: (O, TA:) or, as El-'Otbee
says, may-be, I shall escape God, and my place
will be hidden from Him. (TA.) And ضَلَّ said
of one forgetting means (assumed tropical:)  His memory became
absent from him. (O, Msb, TA.) أَنْ تَضِلَّ إِحْدَاهُمَا,
or إِنْ تَضِلَّ, in the Kur [ii. 282], accord. to different readers, (TA,) in which instance أَنْ and إِنْ
are syn., (Mughnee, [see أَنْ, in p. 106, cols. 1
and 2,]) means If one of them twain [referring to
women] be absent from her memory: or if the
memory of one of them twain be absent from her:
[or if one of them twain err in her memory:] or,
accord. to Zj, the meaning of the verb in this case
is that which next follows. (TA.) ―
-b6-  ضَلِلْتُ
الشَّىْءَ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  I forgot the thing: whence
one says of a woman, ضَلَّتْ أَيَّامَ حَيْضِهَا (assumed tropical:)  [She
forgot the days of her menstruation]; and so
↓ أَضَلَّتْهَا: (Mgh:) or ضَلَّ فُلَانًا (assumed tropical:)  He was made,
or caused, to forget such a one. (K. [In the CK,
اُنْسِيْهِ is erroneously put for أُنْسِيَهُ.]) It is said
that لَا يَضِلُّ رَبِّى, in the Kur xx. 54, means (assumed tropical:)  My
Lord will not be unmindful: or nothing will escape
Him. (TA.) ―
-b7-  And one says, ضَلَّنِى فُلَانٌ, (Msb,
K,) or ضَلَّنِى فُلَانٌ فَلَمْ أَقْدَرْ عَلَيْهِ, (O,) meaning
Such a one went away from me, (O, Msb, K,)
and I was unable to compass him [or to find him]:
so in the Bári'. (Msb.)
-A2-  ضُلَّ, as a verb of
wonder: see ضُلٌّ.
2
ضلَلهُ, (S, MA, O, K,) inf. n. تَضْلِيلٌ and
تَضْلَالٌ, (K,) He, or it, made, or caused, him to
pursue a course that led to error, or deviation
from the right way: (K: [see also 4:]) he,
or it, led him astray; seduced him: (MA:)
[or] he attributed, or imputed, to him error,
or deviation from the right way. (S, MA,
O.) ضُلِّلَ سَعْيُهُمْ, a phrase used by a poet, means
Error, or deviation from the right way, was attributed to their labour; because they did not
reach their goal. (Ham p. 771.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] one
says, ضَلِّلْ مَالَكَ Send forth, or set free, thy cattle
to pasture, or to pasture where they please, by
themselves. (O.) ―
-b3-  See also the next paragraph.
4
اضلّهُ, inf. n. إِضْلَالٌ, He, or it, made him,
or caused him, to err, stray, or go astray; to
deviate from the right way or course, or from that
which was right; to miss, or lose, the right way;
or to lose his way. (Az, TA.) [See also 2, first
sentence.] الإِضْلَالُ is of two sorts: one of these
is the consequence of erring, or straying; either
as in the case in which one says أَضْلَلْتُ البَعِيرَ
(expl. above, see 1, former half); or the decreeing
that one shall err, or stray, &c., because he has
done so already, and this is sometimes the case
when the إِضْلَال of a man is attributed to God:
the other sort is the embellishing [or commending]
to a man that which is false, or wrong, or vain, in
order that he may err, or stray, &c.: and God's
إِضْلَال of a man is of two sorts; one of which has
been expl. above; the other is God's so constituting man that when he observes [and pursues] a
certain course, or way, [of acting or the like],
whether it be such as is commended or such as is
discommended, he habituates himself to it, and
esteems it pleasant, and keeps to it, and finds it
difficult to turn from it, wherefore it is said that
custom is a second nature. (Er-Rághib, TA.) ―
-b2-
Also He, or it, made, or caused, him, or it, to
perish, or become lost; syn. أَهْلَكَهُ, (S, TA,) and
أَضَاعَهُ, (El-Fárábee, S, O, Msb,) or ضَيَّعَهُ; (TA;)
[اضاعهُ and ضيّعهُ signifying the same; and so
اضلّهُ and ↓ ضللّٰهُ; whence,] أَلَمْ يَجْعَلْ كَيْدَهُمْ
فِى تَضْلِيلٍ, in the Kur cv. 2, means [Did He not
make their plot to be such as ended] in a causing
to perish, or become lost, (فِى تَضْيِيعٍ,) and in annulment? (Ksh, Bd.) أَضَلَّ أَعْمَالَهُمْ, in the Kur
[xlvii. 1 and 9, which may be rendered (assumed tropical:)  He will
cause their works to be lost, or to be of no effect],
means, accord. to Aboo-Is-hák, He will not recompense them for their good works; the phrase being
similar to the saying قَدْ ضَلَّ سَعْيُكَ [expl. above].
(TA.) And أَضَلَّ اللّٰهُ ضَلَالَكَ (assumed tropical:)  [May God make
thine erring to be no more, or to come to an end,]
is expl. by ISk as meaning may thine erring pass
away from thee, so that thou shalt not err; and
he adds that the saying مَلَّ مَلَالُكَ means ذَهَبَ
عَنْكَ حَتَّى لَا تَمَلَّ. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Also (tropical:)  He buried,
and hid, or concealed, him, or it. (K, TA.) You
say, أُضِلَّ المَيِّتُ (tropical:)  The dead was buried. (S, O.)
The phrase أَضَلَّتْ بِهِ أُمُّهُ, meaning (tropical:)  His mother
buried him, in a verse cited by IAar, is extr.,
or anomalous. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And He found him
to be erring, straying, going astray; deviating
from the right way or course, or from that which
was right; missing, or losing, the right way;
losing his way; not rightly directed, or not finding
the way to the truth: like as one says أَحْمَدَهُ, and
أَبْخَلَهُ. (TA.) ―
-b5-  And you say, أَضَلَّنِى كَذَا,
meaning (assumed tropical:)  Such a thing was, or became, beyond
my power, or compass. (IAar, Msb, TA.) ―
-b6-
See also 1, near the end.
5
تظلّل It went away: so in the saying,
تضلّل المَآءُ مِنْ تَحْتِ الحَجَرِ [The water went
away from beneath the stone]. (O, TA.)
6
تضالّ He feigned himself to be erring, straying, going astray; deviating from the right way
or course, or from that which was right; missing,
or losing, the right way; or losing his way.
(O, TA.)
10
استضلّ ضَلَالُهُ His erring demanded that
he should err [the more], so that he did err
[the more: like as erring is said to be a cause
of one's being made to err: see 4: and see also
ضَلَّ ضَلَالُهُ, near the beginning of the art.]: so
in the saying of Aboo-Dhu-eyb,
رَآهَا الفُؤَادُ فَاسْتَضَلَّ ضَلَالُهُ
[The heart beheld her, and his erring demanded
that he should err &c.]. (Skr, S, TA.)
ضَلٌّ: see ضَلَالٌ.
ضُلٌّ: see ضَلَالٌ. ―
-b2-  [Also, app. as meaning
A lost state; a state of perishing, coming to nought,
or passing away;] a subst. from ضَلَّ signifying
ضَاعَ and هَلَكَ. (S, TA.) ―
-b3-  And hence [its usage,
in the manner of a proper name, in] the saying,
هُوَ ضُلُّ بْنُ ضُلٍّ, (S,) which means, (S, O, K,) as
also ↓ هُوَ ضِلُّ بْنُ ضِلٍّ, (Ibn-'Abbád, O, K,) He
is the unknown, the son of the unknown; (S, Z, O,
K;) and in like manner, بْنُ التَّلَالِ ↓ الضَّلَالُ; (S,
O;) and قُلُّ بْنُ قُلٍّ: (TA:) or he is one in whom is
no good: (K:) or he is one who persists in error.
(M, K.) ―
-b4-  [Hence also, perhaps, it is said that]
يَا ضُلَّ مَا تَجْرِى بِهِ العَصَا [in the CK ضَلَّ] means
يَا فَقْدَهُ and يَا تَلَفَهُ [i. e., app., O the loss, or O
the coming to nought, of that by reason of which
the mare El-'Asà is running!]: (K, TA:) a
prov.; said by Kaseer Ibn-Saad to Jedheemeh
El-Abrash, when he went with him to Ez-Zebbà;
for when they were within her province, he repented, and Kaseer said to him, “Mount this my
horse, and escape upon him, for his dust will not
be cloven [by the pursuer,” i. e. he will not be
overtaken]: (TA: [but the mare is thus made a
male:]) or it was said by 'Amr Ibn-'Adee, when
he saw El-'Asà, the mare of Jedheemeh, with
Kaseer upon her: قَوْمُ is suppressed after يا; and
↓ ضُلَّ is of the forms [of verbs] denoting wonder,
originally ضَلُلَ, with damm, like حُبَّ in the
phrase حُبَّ بِفُلَانٍ, originally حَبُبَ; and the
meaning of the prov. is, O people, what a case of
perdition is that by reason of which El-'Asà is
running! i. e., the death of Jedheemeh. (Meyd.)
―
-b5-  ضُلٌّ بِتَضْلَالٍ [in CK ضَلٌّ] means A vain, or
futile, thing: (S, O, K:) [or a vain, misleading
thing; تَضْلَالٌ being an inf. n. of ضَلَّلَ:] 'Amr
Ibn-Shás El-Asadee says,
تَذَكَّرْتُ لَيْلَى لَاتَ حِينَ ادِكَارِهَا
وَقَدْ حُنِىَ الأَضْلَاعُ ضُلٌّ بِتَضْلَالِ
[I remembered Leylà when it was not a time for
remembering her, the ribs having become bent by
the bending of the back with age: it was a vain,
misleading thing]. (S, O.) ―
-b6-  ضُلُّ أَضْلَالٍ: see
ضِلَّةٌ.
هُوَ ضِلُّ بْنُ ضِلٍّ: see ضُلٌّ. ―
-b2-  ضِلُّ أَضْلَالٍ: see
ضِلَّةٌ.
ضَلَّةٌ Confusion, or perplexity, and inability to
see the right course: (K:) [or error: for] one
says, فَعَلَ ذٰلِكَ ضَلَّةً He did that in error (فِى
ضَلَالَةٍ): and ذَهَبَ ضَلَّةً He went away not knowing whither he went: (TA:) and فُلَانٌ يَلُومُنِى ضَلَّةً
Such a one blames me wrongly: (S, O:) [or, behind
my back, or in my absence: for] ضَلَّةٌ signifies
also speech respecting a person behind his back, or
in his absence; relating to good and to evil. (M,
K, TA.)
-A2-  [Freytag explains it as signifying also
One in whom is no good, on the authority of Meyd.]
ضُلَّةٌ Skill in guiding, or directing aright, in
journeying. (Fr, K, * TA.)
ضِلَّةٌ: see ضَلَالٌ. ―
-b2-  [Hence,] هُوَ ابْنُهُ لِضِلَّةٍ
(tropical:)  He is his son unlawfully begotten, or not trueborn. (AZ, A, K, TA.) ―
-b3-  ذَهَبَ دَمُهُ ضِلَّةً (tropical:)  His
blood went unrevenged, or without retaliation. (K,
TA.) ―
-b4-  And هُوَ تِبْعُ ضِلَّةٍ, (Th, O, K, TA,) with
kesr to the ت and to the ض, (TA,) [in the CK,
erroneously, تَبَعُ,] and تِبْعٌ ضِلَّةٌ, (K, TA,) thus
related by IAar, (TA,) but the former only accord.
to Th, (TA in art. تبع,) (assumed tropical:)  He is a follower of
women: (TA in that art.:) or he is one in whom
is no good, and with whom is no good: (IAar,
Th, TA:) or he is a very cunning man (دَاهِيَةٌ),
one in whom is no good; (IAar, O, K, TA;) and
so تِبْعُ صِلَّةٍ, (O, L, TA,) as some relate it; (L,
TA;) and in like manner, أَضْلَالٍ ↓ ضِلُّ, (Lh, O,
K, TA,) and أَضْلَالٍ ↓ ضُلُّ, (K, TA,) and صِلُّ
أَصْلَالٍ, [q. v.,] which is with kesr only, (K, TA,)
a phrase similar to ضِرُّ أَضْرَارٍ. (TA in art. ضر.)
ضَلَلٌ: see ضَلَالٌ. ―
-b2-  Also Water (O, K) running (K) beneath a rock, which the sun does not
reach: (O, K:) one says مَآءٌ ضَلَلٌ: (O:) or
running among trees. (K.) [See also ضَلَلٌ.]
ضَلَالٌ [an inf. n. of 1: used as a simple subst.,]
Error; contr. of رَشَادٌ, (S, O, TA,) and of هُدًى;
(K, TA;) as also ↓ ضَلَالَةٌ, (S, O, K,) and ↓ ضَلٌّ,
and ↓ ضُلٌّ, and ↓ ضِلَّةٌ, and ↓ ضَلَلٌ, and ↓ ضَلْضَلَةٌ,
(K,) and ↓ ضُلَضِلَةٌ, (O, TA,) and ↓ أُضْلُولَةٌ, (K,)
of which last the pl. is أَضَالِيلُ, (Lth, O, TA,) as
in the saying تَمَادَى فِى أَضَالِيلِ الهَوَى [He persevered in the errors of love], (TA,) or أَضَالِيلُ, as
some say, has no sing., or its sing. is supposed,
or has been heard, and is أُضْلُولَةٌ or أُضْلُولٌ or
إِضْلِيلٌ or some other form: (MF, TA:) the
primary signification of الضَّلَالُ is the going away
from the right course, or direction: (Ham
p. 357:) or it signifies, accord. to Ibn-El-Kemál,
the loss, or missing, of that which brings, or conducts, to the object sought: or, as some say, the
pursuing a way that will not bring, or conduct,
to that object: or, accord. to Er-Rághib, the
deviating from the right way: and it is said to
be any deviation from that which is right, intentional or unintentional, little or much; because
the right and approved way is very difficult;
wherefore it may be used of him who commits
any mistake whatever, and is imputed to prophets
and to unbelievers, though between the ضلال of
the former and that of the latter is a wide difference: and in another point of view, it is of two
sorts; one is in the speculative departments of
knowledge, as in acquaintance with the unity of
God, and with the prophetic function or office,
and the like, indicated in the Kur iv. 135; or it
is in the practical departments of knowledge, as
in acquaintance with the ordinances of the law,
that is, religious services. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also A state
of perdition: so in the Kur liv. 24: (S, O:)
[and in like manner ↓ ضَلَالَةٌ; for] ضَلَالَةُ العَمَلِ
signifies The annulled and lost state of work.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  And Absence, or a state of concealment.
(Msb. [This is there said to be the primary signification.]) ―
-b4-  هُوَ الضَّلَالُ بْنُ التَّلَالِ see expl.
voce ضُلٌّ.
ضَلُولٌ: see ضَالٌّ.
ضَلَالَةٌ: see ضَلَالٌ, in the beginning, and near
the end, of the paragraph. One says, هِىَ الضَّلَالَةُ
وَالتَّلَالَةُ; (S, O;) in which the latter noun is an
imitative sequent. (S and K in art. تل.)
ضِلِّيلٌ A man (S, O) who errs, strays, goes
astray, or deviates from the right way or course,
much, or often: (S, O, K:) or (tropical:)  who errs, &c.,
much, or often, in religion: (TA:) and ↓ مُضَلَّلٌ,
(S, TA,) which in some of the copies of the S is
written thus and also مُضَلِّل, (TA,) signifies the
same; (S, TA;) or one who is not disposed, or
directed, to good; in the K, الّذى لا يُوَفِّى بِخَيْرٍ,
[or يُوفِى بخير, as in the CK,] but correctly الّذى
لا يُوَفَّقُ لِخَيْرٍ; or, as some say, a committer of
errors, and of false, wrong, or vain, actions: and
ضِلِّيلٌ is also expl. as signifying one who will not
desist from error. (TA.) Imra-el-Keys was
called المَلِكُ الضِّلِّيلُ [The much-erring king], (S,
O, K, TA, [in the CK, erroneously, الضَّلِيلُ,])
and ↓ الملك المُضَلَّلُ. (K.)
ضَالٌّ Erring, straying, or going astray; deviating from the right way or course, or from
that which is right; missing, or losing, the right
way; or losing his way; (S, * Msb, TA;) and
↓ ضَلُولٌ is syn. therewith; (K;) [or rather with
ضِلِّيلٌ, accord. to a general rule:] pl. of the former
ضُلَّالٌ, [of which see an ex. in a verse cited voce
رِسْلٌ,] and ضُالُّونَ: [in the Kur i. last verse,]
some read وَلَا الضَّأَلِّينَ, to avoid the concurrence
of two quiescent letters. (TA.) You say ضَالٌّ
تَالٌّ; (S, O;) in which the latter epithet is an
imitative sequent. (S and K in art. تل.) ―
-b2-
[Also Becoming lost; &c. ―
-b3-  And Forgetting.
It is said that] وَأَنَا مِنَ الضَّالِّينَ [in the Kur
xxvi. 19] means (assumed tropical:)  I being of those that forgot.
(K, TA.) And اِمرَأَةٌ ضَالَّةٌ means (assumed tropical:)  A woman
forgetting the days of her menstruation. (Mgh.)
ضَالَّةٌ an epithet in which the quality of a subst.
is predominant, (IAth, TA,) A stray; i. e. a
beast that has strayed: (S, O, TA:) or a camel
remaining in a place where it is lost, without an
owner (K, TA) that is known: (TA:) or a lost
animal (IAth, Msb, TA) or other thing, whatever
it be: (IAth, TA:) applied to the male and to
the female, (S, O, Msb, K,) and to two and to a
pl. number: (TA;) and it has for its pl. ضَوَالُّ,
(Msb, TA,) like دَوَابُّ pl. of دَابَّةٌ. (Msb.) It is
said in a trad., ضَالَّةُ المُؤْمِنِ حَرَقُ النَّارِ [expl. in
art. حرق]. (TA.) And one says, الحِكْمَةُ ضَالَّةُ
المُؤْمِنِ (assumed tropical:)  [Wisdom is the object of persevering
quest of the believer]; meaning that the believer
ceases not to seek wisdom like as a man seeks his
stray. (TA.)
ضَلَضِلٌ and ↓ ضَلَضِلَةٌ, (As, S,) as though contracted from ضَلَاضِلٌ [and ضَلَاضِلَةٌ], (S,) or أَرْضٌ
↓ ضَلَضِلَةٌ and ضَلَضِلٌ [in the CK ضَلَضَلَةٌ and
صَلَضَلٌ] and ↓ ضُلَضِلَةٌ and ↓ ضُلَضِلٌ (K) and
↓ ضُلَاضِلٌ (Lh, K) and ضُلْضُلَةٌ, (IDrd, K,)
Rugged land or ground. (As, S, K.) And مَكَانٌ
ضَلَضِلٌ, originally ضَلَاضِيلُ, A hard, stony place.
(Fr, TA.) ―
-b2-  Also, (so in the K,) i. e. (TA)
ضَلَضِلٌ and ↓ ضَلَضِلَةٌ, accord. to As, (O, TA,)
or ↓ ضُلَضِلَةٌ, (S, O, TA,) [said to be] the only
instance of its kind among reduplicate words,
(S, O, TA, [in which last the same assertion is
quoted from the T, app. in relation to the last, or
last but one, of these words,]) and, as in the Jm,
↓ ضُلْضُلَةٌ, (O, TA,) A stone, (As, S, O,) or stones,
