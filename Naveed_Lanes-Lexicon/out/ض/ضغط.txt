for مُجَاهَدَةٌ, as meaning (assumed tropical:)  The exertion of one's

him: (Meyd: see مُعَرَّكٌ:) or skin collected together: or the base of the callous protuberance

answered, (L,) كَانَ عَلَىَّ ضَاغِطٌ [There was over
me a watcher], (S,) or كَانَ مَعِى ضَاغِطٌ [There
was with me a watcher], meaning God, who
knows the secrets of men; or he meant, by
ضاغط, the trust committed to him by God, which
he had taken upon himself; but his wife imagined
that there was with him a watcher who straitened
him, and prevented his taking to please her. (L.)
