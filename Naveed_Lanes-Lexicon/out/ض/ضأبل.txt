ضأبلضِئْبِلٌ, and ضِئْبُلٌ, (S, M, O, K,) like زِئْبِرٌ and
زِئْبُرٌ, (S, O, K,) the latter mentioned by IJ, (M,)
but the former the more usual, (S, M,) Calamity,
or misfortune: (S, M, O, K:) [it is said that]
زِئْبُرٌ and ضِئْبُلٌ are the only instances of the
measure فِعْلُلٌ: (K:) but accord. to Th, there is
no word of this measure in the language; therefore, if these two have been heard, they are extr.,
unless, as Ibn-Keysán says, the ء be augmentative
[and there is no reason for supposing it to be so as
there is no known unaugmented word from the
root ضبل]: (S, O:) صِئْبُلٌ, however, with ص,
has been mentioned in the K, as having the same
meaning, and is said to be of the dial. of Dabbeh,
but not so well known as ضئبل, with ض; and
IB mentions نِئْدُلٌ, meaning [likewise the same,
or] “ incubus,” or “ nightmare: ” [but one of
these four instances may be excepted; for] it is
said in the K [in art. زَأبر] that زِئْبُرٌ may be incorrect. (TA.)
