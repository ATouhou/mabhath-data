ضيع1
ضَاعَ, aor. يَضِيعُ, inf. n. ضَيَاعٌ and ضَيْعَةٌ (S,
Mgh, O, Msb, K) and ضَيْعٌ and ضِيعٌ, (K,) It (a
thing, S, Mgh, O, Msb) perished, came to nought,
passed away, or became lost. (S, O, Msb, K.)
It is said in a trad. of Saad, إِنِّى أَخَافُ عَلَى
الأَعْنَابِ الضَّيْعُةَ i. e. [Verily I fear, for the
grapes,] their [lit. the] perishing, or becoming lost.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  And ضاع, (K, TA,) inf. n. ضَيَاعٌ and
ضَيْعَةٌ, (TA,) It (a thing) was left; left, or let,
alone; or neglected. (K, TA.) Hence, ضاعت
الإِبِلُ, and ضاع العِيَالُ, The camels, and the family,
or household, were left untended, and unminded;
and were left alone, or neglected. (TA.)
-A2-  ضاع,
aor. يَضِيعُ, said of perfume, or sweet odour, i. q.
ضاع having for its aor. يَضُوعُ. (Har p. 670.)
[See 5 in art. ضوع: and see also 5 in the present
art.]

ضيّع الشَّىْءَ, (O, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَضْيِيعٌ;
(S;) and ↓ اضاعهُ, (O, Msb, K,) inf. n. إِضَاعَةٌ;
(S;) both signify the same; (S, O, Msb, K;)
He made, or caused, the thing to perish, or become lost; he destroyed it, wasted it, or lost it.
(Msb, K, TA.) Hence, ضَيَّعُوا فُلَانًا is used by
the vulgar as meaning They beheaded such a one
with the sword. (TA.) It is said in a prov.,
الصَّيْفَ ضَيَّعْتِ اللَّبَنَ [In the spring, or in the summer, thou losedst the milk], in which the ت is
with kesr when the words are addressed to a
male, or to a female, or to a pl. number, because
originally addressed to a woman, the wife of a
wealthy man, whom she disliked because of his
being aged, wherefore he divorced her, and a poor
man married her, and she sent to her first
husband requesting a gift, and he answered her
thus; (S, O, K; *) الصيف being in the accus. case
as an adv. n.: so says Yaakoob: (S, O:) or
El-Aswad Ibn-Hurmuz divorced his wife El-
' Anood Esh-Shenneeyeh, (O, K,) of the BenooShenn, (TA,) preferring to her a beautiful and
wealthy woman of his people; (O, K; *) then
there occurred between them what led to their
separation, and he sought to obtain [again] El-
' Anood, and sent a message to her; but in replying to him she said,
أَنْشَأْتَ تَطْلُبُ وَصْلَنَا
فِى الصَّيْفِ ضَيَّعْتَ اللَّبَنْ
[Thou hast begun to seek our union: in the spring,
or in the summer, thou losedst the milk]: (O, *
K:) the ت in this case being with fet-h. (K.
[See more in Freytag's Arab. Prov. ii. 197-8, or
in Har p. 577; in both of which, however, and
in the O, ضيّعت is with kesr in the latter case,
as in the former.]) [One says also, ضيّع عَهْدَهُ,
meaning He broke his compact, contract, or
covenant]. The phrase, in a trad., نَهَى عَنْ
المَالِ ↓ إِضَاعَةِ means He forbade the expending of
wealth otherwise than in obedience to God, and
the squandering thereof, and extravagance. (TA.)

اضاع الشَّىْءَ: see 2, first sentence, and last
but one. ―
-b2-  Also, [and app. ↓ ضيّعهُ likewise,
accord. to the K,] He left the thing; left it, or
let it, alone; or neglected it. (K, TA.) You
say, اضاع عِيَالَهُ He neglected his family, or household; omitted taking good care of them, or being
mindful of them. (TA.) وَمَا كَانَ اللّٰهُ لِيُضِعَ
إِيمَانَكُمْ, in the Kur [ii. 138], means And God
will not neglect [or make to be lost] your prayer.
(TA.) أَضَاعُوا الصَّلَاةَ, in the same, [xix. 60,]
means Who neglected, or omitted, prayer, (Bd,
TA,) altogether: (TA:) or deferred it: (Bd:)
or who performed it in other than its right time:
but the first explanation is more suitable, for the
unbelievers are meant thereby. (TA.)
-A2-  اضاع
[is also intrans., and] may signify He found his
affair to be coming to nought. (Ham p. 33.) ―
-b2-
And His estates (ضِيَاعُهُ) became wide-spread, (S,
O, K,) and many, or numerous. (S, O, Msb, K.)

تضيّع, said of the wind, It blew: because it
[often] destroys that upon which it blows: so says
Er-Rághib. (TA. [But it may be from what here
follows.]) ―
-b2-  Said of musk, It diffused its odour,
or fragrance: (S, O, K;) a dial. var. of تضوّع:
(S:) or an instance of substitution [of ى for و].
(O.) [See also 1, last explanation.]
مَاتَ ضِيْعًا and ضِيَعًا: see ضَيَاعٌ.
ضَيْعَةٌ an inf. n. of 1. (S, &c.) ―
-b2-  See ضَيَاعٌ,
below, last sentence but one. ―
-b3-  Also A single
case, or occasion, of perishing, coming to nought,
passing away, or becoming lost; or of being left,
left or let alone, or neglected. (TA.) ―
-b4-  تَرَكْتُهُ
بِضَيْعَةٍ means I left him unsought-after, or unminded, or unmissed. (TA. [See also a similar
phrase voce ضَيَاعٌ.])
-A2-  Also i. q. عَقَارٌ [meaning
An estate consisting of land, or of land and a
house, or of a house or land yielding a revenue, or
of a house and palm-trees, or the like]; (S, O,
Msb, K;) and [particularly] land yielding a
revenue; (K;) or with the people of the towns
and villages and cultivated lands it signifies the
property, of a man, consisting of palm-trees and
grape-vines and land: but the Arabs [of the
desert] know not the word in this sense: (Az,
TA:) IF says, I do not reckon the application
of this word as a name for the عَقَار to be of the
original language, but think it to be an innovation
in speech; and I have heard it said that this is
termed a ضيعة because, when frequent attention to
it is neglected, it perishes; and if it be so, this is
an evidence of what we have said, that it is of the
innovated speech: (O, TA:) the dim. is ↓ ضُيَيْعَةٌ,
for which one should not say ضُوَيْعَةٌ: (S, O, K:)
the pl. is ضِيَاعٌ and ضِيَعٌ, (S, O, Msb, K,) as
though the latter were a contraction of the
former, (Msb,) and ضَيْعَاتٌ: (K:) accord. to Lth,
the first of these pls. signifies places of alighting
or abode or settlement; which are thus called because, when the paying frequent attention to
them, or taking good care of them, and the keeping them, or putting them, in a good state, or state
of repair, is neglected, they come to nought: and
ضَيْعَاتٌ occurs in a trad. as meaning the means of
subsistence. (TA.) And, (T, O, Msb, K,) as
used by the Arabs [of the desert], who know not
the word in any other sense than this, (T, O,) A
craft, or handicraft, by which one gains his subsistence; a mode, or manner, of gain; or any
habitual work or occupation of a man; (T, O,
Msb, K) as the sewing of skins or boots and the
like; and the twisting of ropes; and the weaving,
or plaiting, of palm-leaves; and the culture of
palm-trees (عَمَلُ النَّخْلِ); and the pasturing of
camels; and the like thereof; (T, O;) including
the sowing, or tilling, of land: (TA:) or the
ضَيْعَة of the Arabs was the management, or tending, of camels and of sheep and goats: and the
term includes a man's craft, or handicraft, or
means of gain: (Sh, O:) and his traffic: (Sh,
O, K:) one says to a man, قُمْ إِلَى ضَيْعَتِكَ [Arise
to thy craft, &c.]: (Sh, O:) and كُلُّ رَجُلٍ
وَضَيْعَتَهُ, [Every man should occupy himself
with his proper craft, &c.] (Msb.) أَفْشَى اللّٰهُ,
ضَيْعَتَهُ, occurring in a trad., means God made or
may God make, his means of subsistence to be
abundant. (TA.) And one says, فَشَتْ ضَيْعَتُهُ,
[or, more commonly, فَشَتْ عَلَيْهِ ضَيْعَتُهُ, as in the
TA in art. فشو, &c.,] which is said to mean His
property was, or became, large, or abundant, [or
wide-spread,] so that he was unable to collect it
together: and [hence] his means of attaining his
object [or his affairs (as in the TA in art. فشو)]
became disordered so that he knew not with which
of them to begin: (TA:) or he took to doing an
affair that did not concern him: (TA, and Ham
p. 33:) it is nearly like the saying اِتَّسَعَ الخَرْقُ
عَلَى الرَّاقِعِ [expl. in art. خرق]. (Ham ibid.)
And إِنِّى لَأَرَى ضَيْعَةً لَا يُصْلِحُهَا إِلَّا ضَجْعَةٌ [Verily
I see property that nothing but a sleep will
restore to a right state] a prov.; said by a pastor
whose camels had dispersed themselves, and who,
desiring to collect them together, and being unable to do so, sought aid of sleep. (O.)
مَاتَ ضِيعَةً: see the next paragraph.
ضَيَاعٌ an inf. n. of 1 [q. v.]. (S, &c.) [Hence]
one says, مَاتَ ضَيَاعًا, as also ↓ ضِيَعًا, and ↓ ضِيْعًا,
and ↓ ضِيعَةٌ, He (a man, TA) died unsought-after,
or unminded, or unmissed. (K, TA. [See also a
similar phrase voce ضَيْعَةٌ.]) ―
-b2-  Also A family,
or household: (ISh, O, K:) or the meaning is
عِيَالٌ ضُيَّعٌ, (Mgh, O, K, *) i. e. a family, or
household, neglected, untended, and unminded;
(TA;) or such as are exposed, or liable, to perish,
(بِعَرَضِ أَنْ يَضِيعَ,) as young children, and those
who are crippled, or deprived of the power of
motion, who cannot manage their own affairs:
(Mgh:) occurring in a trad., in which it is said
that when a man died leaving such as are thus
termed, (تَرَكَ ضَيَاعًا,) they were to be brought to
the Prophet, (Mgh, O,) to be maintained by
means of the government-treasury: (Mgh:) a
prefixed noun is to be understood [i. e. it is for
عِيَالَ ضَيَاعٍ or the like]: (Mgh:) or it is an inf. n.
used as a subst. [properly thus termed]: (Mgh,
O:) or, accord. to one relation of the trad., the
word is ↓ ضَيْعَةً [which is likewise an inf. n., and
in this case to be expl. in the same manner]:
(Mgh:) if read ضِيَاعًا, it would be pl. of ضَائِعٌ.
(Mgh, O.)
-A2-  Also A sort of perfume, or odoriferous substance. (K.)
ضُيَيْعَةٌ dim. of ضَيْعَةٌ, q. v. (S, O, K.)
ضَائعٌ Perishing, coming to nought, passing
away, or becoming lost: (Mgh, * Msb:) [and

Msb, K) and ضُيَّعٌ. (Mgh, O, * Msb, K. *) [See

-b2-  And
A man in a state of poverty: or having a family,
or household, to sustain: or in a state of circumstances by means of which he is unable to subsist.

-b3-  فُلَانٌ يَأْكُلُ فِى مِعًى ضَائِعٍ means جَائِعٍ
[i. e. Such a one eats into a hungry, or an empty,
gut]: and it was said to the daughters of ElKhuss, “What is the sharpest thing? (مَا أَحَدُّ
شَىْء;) and she answered, نَابٌ جَائِعٌ يُلْقِى فِى
مِعًى ضَائِعٍ [A hungry canine tooth that throws
the food into an empty gut]. (S.)
أَضْيَعُ means أَكْثَرُ ضَيَاعًا: so in the saying,
فُلَانٌ أَضْيَعُ مِنْ فُلَانٍ [Such a one is in a more
perishing state than such a one]. (TA.)
مُضِيعٌ act. part. n. of the trans. v. اضاع. (TA.)
[See مِسْيَاعٌ, in art. سوع.]
-A2-  And part. n. of the
intrans. v. اضاع; as such signifying One whose
estates (ضِيَاعُهُ) are becoming wide-spread, and
many, or numerous. (S, TA.)
مَضِيعَةٌ and مَضْيَعَةٌ i. q. ضَيَاعٌ [an inf. n. of 1,
q. v.]. (Mgh, O, Msb, K.) So in the saying,
تَرَكَ عِيَالَهُ بِمَضِيعَةٍ or بِمَضْيَعَةٍ [He left his family,
or household, in a state of perishing, &c.]. (Mgh.)
So too in the saying, السَّارِقُ لَا يُقْطَعُ فِى مَالٍ
بِمَضِيعَةٍ [The thief shall not suffer amputation of
his hand in the case of his stealing property in a
neglected state]. (Mgh.) And so in the saying,
هُوَ بِدَارِ مَضِيعَةٍ (S, * O, K) and مَضْيَعَةٍ (O, K) [He
is in a place (lit. an abode) of perdition, &c.]:
or as meaning in this saying, abandonment, and
ignominy. (TA.) And هُوَ مُقِيمٌ بِدَارِ مَضِيعَةٍ or
مَضْيَعَةٍ means [He is dwelling in the abode of indolence; or] his characteristic in his affairs is
indolence. (Msb.) ―
