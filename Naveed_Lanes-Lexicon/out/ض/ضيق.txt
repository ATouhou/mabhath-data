ضيق1
ضَاقَ, aor. يَضِيقُ, inf. n. ضَيْقٌ (S, O, Msb,
K) and ضِيقٌ, (S, O, K,) or this latter is a simple
subst., (Msb,) It was, or became, narrow, or
strait; contr. of اِتَّسَعَ; (Msb, K;) as also
↓ تضيّق, [or rather this signifies it was, or became, rendered narrow, or strait, being quasipass. of 2,] and ↓ تضايق: (K:) it is said of a
thing, (S, O, Msb,) and of a place. (Msb.)
[See also ضَيْقٌ below.] ضَاقَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ الْأَرْضُ, in the
Kur ix. 119, means The earth became strait to
them. (Bd, Jel.) And one says, ضَاقَتْ بِهِ الأَرْضُ
[meaning, in like manner, The earth, or land, became narrow, or strait, with him]: 'Amr Ibn-El-Ahtam says,
لَعَمْرُكَ مَا ضَاقَتْ بِلَادٌ بِأَهْلِهَا
وَلٰكِنَّ أَخْلَاقَ الرِّجَالِ تَضِيقُ
[By thy life, or by thy religion, countries have not
become narrow with their inhabitants, but the dispositions of the men become narrow]. (O, TA.)
[ضاق بِهِ often signifies, and so does به ↓ تضايق,
It was, or became, choked, surcharged, or overfilled, with it; for instance, a water-course with
water, and a place with people.] And ↓ تضايق
بِهِ الأَمْرُ means ضاق عَلَيْهِ (tropical:)  [The affair was, or
became, strait to him]. (O, TA. [See an ex. in
art. رحب, conj. 6.]) One says also, ضاق عَلَيْهِ
مَعَاشُهُ: see 4. [And ضاق الوَقْتُ (assumed tropical:)  The time became strait, or contracted.] And ضاق صَدْرُهُ
(assumed tropical:)  His bosom, or mind, became strait, or contracted: (Msb:) and ضاق عَنْهُ صَدْرُكَ (assumed tropical:)  [Thy
mind became so contracted as to be incapable of
it: or thy mind shrank from it]. (K.) [And
يَضِيقُ العَقْلُ عَنْ تَقْدِيرِهِ (assumed tropical:)  The intellect is incapable of determining its limit, or limits, or the like.]
And ضاق عَنِ الجَوَابِ and بِالجَوَابِ (assumed tropical:)  [He was
straitened, or embarrassed, so as to be unable to
reply, or to answer; he was incapable of replying,
or answering]: both signify the same. (TA in
art. زند.) And ضاق بالأَمْرِ ذَرْعًا, (S, * O, * Msb,)
meaning (assumed tropical:)  The thing, or affair, was difficult, or
distressing, to him, (Msb,) originally ضاق ذَرْعُهُ بِهِ,
(S, * O, * Msb,) i. e. his ability [was straitened by
it, or was inadequate to it]; and his power:
(Msb:) or his art, or artifice, or cunning: or
his way, course, mode, or manner, of acting
(مَذْهَبُهُ) [was straitened, or rendered difficult, or
distressing, by it]. (O. [See more voce ذَرْعٌ:
and see a similar phrase in the Kur xi. 79 and
xxix. 32.]) And hence, app., the saying ضاق
المَالُ عَنِ الدُّيُونِ (tropical:)  The property was inadequate
to the debts. (Msb.) And you say, ضاق عَنْكَ
الشَّىْءُ [meaning لَمْ يَسَعْكَ (assumed tropical:)  The thing was not
allowable to thee]: one says, لَا يَسَعُنِى شَىْءٌ وَيَضِيقَ
عَنْكَ, (S, O, * TA, [in the O, erroneously, لا
يستغنى,]) i. e. وَأَنْ يَضِيقَ عَنْكَ (assumed tropical:)  [A thing will not
be allowable to me conjointly with its being disallowable to thee, وَأَنْ يَضِيقٌ meaning مَعَ ضَيْقِهِ]:
بَلْ مَتَى وَسِعَنِى شَىْءٌ وَسِعَكَ [but when a thing is
allowable to me, it is allowable to thee]. (S in
art. وسع.) And ضاق, (aor. يَضَِيقُ, K, inf. n.
ضِيقٌ, TA,) (tropical:)  He was or became, niggardly, or
avaricious. (S, O, Msb, K, TA.)
2
ضيّقهُ, (Msb, K,) inf. n. تَضْيِيقٌ, (Msb, TA,)
He made it strait, or narrow; (Msb, K;)
namely, a place [&c.]; (Msb;) as also ↓ اضاقهُ,
(K,) inf. n. إِضَاقَةٌ. (TA.) You say, ضَيَّقْتُ عَلَيْهِ
المَكَانَ, (S,) or الشَّىْءَ, i. e. I straitened, or made
narrow, to him [the place, or the thing; or I
scanted it, or made it scanty]; contr. of وَسَّعْتُهُ
عَلَيْهِ. (O.) And ضَيَّقْتُ عَلَيْهِ [alone, used elliptically, I straitened him, properly speaking; and
also, (assumed tropical:)  his circumstances &c.]. (Msb.) And ضُيِّقَ
عَلَى فُلَانٍ (assumed tropical:)  [Such a one was straitened]. (TA.)
لِتُضَيِّقُوا عَلَيْهِنَّ, in the Kur [lxv. 6, (assumed tropical:)  In order
that ye may straiten them], implies relation to
expenses and to the bosom. (TA.) [See 3.
التَّضْيِيقُ بَيْنَ شَيْئَيْنِ, occurring in the S and K in
art. حوص, means The making a coarctation
between two things.]
3
ضايقهُ He straitened him: (MA:) [see also
2: or, properly, he straitened him, being in like
manner straitened by him: see 1 in art. زحم: and]
(tropical:)  he treated him, or behaved towards him, with
hardness, or harshness; (O, * K, * TA;) فِى كَذَا
[in, or in respect of, such a thing]. (TA.)

5

تَضَاْيَقَ see 1, in three places. تضايقوا They straitened one another; pushed, or pressed, one against
another; or crowded one another; in a place of
assembly; syn. زَحَمَ بَعْضُهُمْ بَعْضًا: (Msb in art.
زحم:) or they became straitened in a place, or
(assumed tropical:)  in disposition. (S, O.)
10
استضاقت بِدُرْجَةٍ [She endeavoured to constrict her vagina by means of a pessary], (O, K,
TA,) or بِالأَدْوِيَةِ [by means of medicaments]; (A,
TA;) said of a woman. (A, O, K.)
ضَيْقٌ an inf. n. of 1, (S, O, Msb, K,) as also
↓ ضِيقٌ, (S, O, K,) or the latter is a simple subst.:
(Msb:) [both, used as simple substs., signify
Narrowness, or straitness:] accord. to Fr, [both
seem to signify thus; but the latter, properly;
and the former, tropically; for he says that]
الضَّيْقُ is in that which does not [really] become
wide, like the mind (الصَّدْر): (O:) or it is
مَا ضَاقَ عَنْهُ صَدْرُكَ [that of which the mind by its
being contracted is incapable, or from which the
mind shrinks; an explanation not given in the K
as on the authority of Fr, and deviating from
his words as given in the O; whence it appears
that, for مَا, we should perhaps read فِيمَا]: (K:)
but ↓ الضِّيقُ is in that which may be [really] wide,
like the house and the garment: (O, K:) and
the former [is also used as an epithet, being a
contraction of ضَيِّقٌ in this case, and as such]
has a dual and a plural and a feminine; but
the latter has not: (O:) or ↓ both are alike [in
signification]: (K:) and ↓ ضَيْقَةٌ is syn. with ضِيقٌ.
(S.) ―
-b2-  Also, and ↓ ضَيَقٌ, accord. to AA, (O,
[the latter there expressly said to be بِالتَّحْرِيكِ,])
or the former and ↓ ضِيقٌ, (K, [said in the TA to
be a mistake for ضَيَقٌ, but see what follows,])
Doubt (AA, O, K) in the heart: (K) the first
is more common than the second, in this sense;
and occurs in the Kur in xvi. last verse and
xxvii. 72: (O:) [but] Ibn-Ketheer read, in both
of these instances, ↓ ضِيق; and this and ضَيْق
are dial. vars. signifying straitness of mind. (Bd.)
-A2-  See also ضَيِّقٌ, in two places: ―
-b2-  and ضَيْقَةٌ,
second sentence, in two places.
ضِيقٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in five
places.
ضَيَقٌ: see ضَيْقٌ, latter part.
ضَيْقَةٌ: see ضَيْقٌ, latter part. ―
-b2-  Also (S)
(tropical:)  Poverty; and an evil state or condition; (S, O,
K, TA;) and so ↓ ضِيقَةٌ: (K, TA:) and the pl.
[or rather coll. gen. n.] (Fr, S, K, TA) of the
former (Fr, S, TA) is ↓ ضَيْقٌ: (Fr, S, K, TA:
[in the CK, erroneously, ضِيقٌ:]) Fr says, when
you see ↓ الضَّيْق to have occurred in the place of
الضِّيق, it is in [one of] two cases; either it is the
pl. [or coll. gen. n.] of الضَّيْقَةُ; or it means the
narrow, or strait, thing, ضَيْقٌ being a contraction
of ضَيِّقٌ. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And الضَّيْقَةُ, (O,) or ضَيْقَةُ
[without the article], (JK, O, TA,) or ↓ الضِّيقَةُ,
(K, [app. a mistake, for in the O, in every case,
whether as a proper name or not, الضيقة is written
الضَّيْقَةُ,]) is the name of A certain mansion of the
moon, (JK, O, K, TA,) [not one of the Twentyeight Mansions,] close by الثُّرَيَّا [or the Pleiades]:
(JK, O, TA:) or, as IKt says, on the authority
of Ibn-Ziyád El-Kilábee, sometimes the moon
falls short of الدَّبَرَان and alights in الضيقة, i. e.
two small stars, near together, between الثُّرَيَّا and
الدَّابَرَان: (TA:) it is asserted by the Arabs to
be an inauspicious place. (O, * TA.) Hence the
saying of El-Akhtal,
فَهَلَّا زَجَرْتَ الطَّيْرَ لَيْلَةَ جِئْتَهَا
بِضَيْقَةَ بَيْنَ النَّجْمِ وَالدَّبَرَانِ
[And wherefore didst not thou draw an omen
from the flight of birds on the night when thou
camest to her, when the moon was in Deykah,
between the Pleiades and Ed-Debarán?]: he
notifies that the moon, in the night of their
coming together, was making its abode [in the
neighbourhood of] الدبران, which is inauspicious:
(O, TA:) or [the latter hemistich, as J relates it,
app. on the authority of A 'Obeyd, is thus,]
بِضَيْقَةِ بَيْنَ النَّجْمِ وَالدَّبَرَانِ
from الضَّيْقَةُ as syn. with الضَّيْقُ; (S;) and as
AA relates the verse, it is [thus] with kesr to the
ة in بضيقة; the word not being made the
[proper] name of a place, but the meaning being
بضيقة مَا بَيْنَ النجم والدبران [i. e. in the narrow
space between the Pleiades and Ed-Debarán].
(TA.) ―
-b4-  ضَيْقَةٌ is also the fem. of ضَيْقٌ the contracted form of ضَيِّقٌ. (S, O, TA.)
ضِيقَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, former
half, in two places.
ضُوقَى and ضِيقَى are fems. of ↓ أَضْيَقُ; (S, O,
K;) the former [as well as the latter] is
[originally] of the measure فُعْلَى, (TA,) [each
being originally ضُيْقَى,] the ى being changed
in the former into و because quiescent and preceded by dammeh: (S, O, TA:) the former
occurs in the saying of a woman to her fellowwife, contending with her for superiority,
مَا أَنْتِ بِالخُورَى وَلَا الضُّوقَى حِرًا
[Thou art not the better nor the narrower &c.;
خُورَى being in like manner fem. of أَخْيَرُ]. (TA.)
Accord. to Kr, the former is pl. of ↓ ضَيِّقَةٌ;
(TA;) and he says the same of ضِيقَى also; (TA
voce كَيِّسٌ;) but ISd says, I know not how this
may be, for فُعْلَى is not of the measures of pls.
except of the kind of pl. which differs not from its
sing. otherwise than in the latter's having ة [as
an affix], like بُهْمَاةٌ and بُهْمَى [q. v.]. (TA in
the present art.)
ضِيَاقٌ: see مِضْيَاقٌ.
ضَائِقٌ: see the next paragraph, in four places.
ضَيِّقٌ and ↓ ضَيْقٌ, (S, O, K,) the latter a contraction of the former, (S,) the two being like
هَيِّنٌ and هَيْنٌ [&c.], (O,) and ↓ ضَائِقٌ, (K,)
Narrow, or strait: (S, * O, * K:) or ضَيِّقٌ is an
epithet used in this sense when permanence [of
the attribute] is meant [and so therefore is
its contracted form]; and ↓ ضَائِقٌ as meaning
[being, or becoming, narrow or strait; or] temporarily narrow or strait: (Msb:) the fem. of
the first (TA) and of the second (S, O, TA) [as
well as of the third] is with ة: (S, O, TA:) see
also ضُوقَى: [the pls. of the first and second,
applied to rational beings, is ضَيِّقُونَ and ضَيْقُونَ,
like مَيِّتُونَ and مَيْتُونَ: and] the pl. of ↓ ضَائِقٌ is
ضَاقَةً. (TA.) You say شَىْءٌ ضَيِّقٌ (O, Msb) and
↓ ضَيْقٌ (O) A narrow, or strait, thing. (O, *
Msb.) And صَدْرٌ ضَيِّقٌ (assumed tropical:)  A strait, or contracted,
mind; (Msb;) and نَفْسٌ ضَيِّقَةٌ [meaning the
same]. (TA.) And بِهِ صَدْرُكَ ↓ وَضَائقٌ, in the
Kur [xi. 15], means (assumed tropical:)  And thy mind is temporarily strait or contracted thereby. (Msb.)
ضَيِّقٌ signifies also (assumed tropical:)  Niggardly, or avaricious.
(KL.) [And ضَيِّقُ الخُلُقِ (assumed tropical:)  Narrow, or illiberal,
in disposition.]
أَضْيَقُ [More, and most, narrow or strait or
contracted]: (S, O, K:) see its fems. ضُوقَى and
ضِيقَى, above. [See also three exs. voce اِسْتٌ,
in art. سته.]
مَضِيقٌ A narrow, or strait, place: (K:) [a
pass: a place of narrowness or straitness] of land;
and of the vulva; and (assumed tropical:)  [a place, or state, of
straitness] of life, or of the means of subsistence:
(K in art. ازم:) and (tropical:)  a narrow, or strait, affair
or case: (K, TA:) pl. مَضَايِقُ. (TA.)
أَمْرٌ مُضَيَّقٌ (assumed tropical:)  [An affair rendered strait]. (TA.)
مِضْيَاقٌ, (JK, and O on the authority of Ibn-
'Abbád, and TA,) or ↓ ضِيَاقٌ, like كِتَابٌ [in
measure], thus in all the copies of the K, (TA,)
[but probably, I think, taken from a mistranscription,] A pessary (دُرْجَةٌ) of rag and perfume,
with which a woman endeavours to constrict her
vagina (تَسْتَضِيقُ بِهَا). (JK, Ibn-'Abbád, O, K.)
