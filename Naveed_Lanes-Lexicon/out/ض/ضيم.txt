ضيم1
ضَامَهُ, (S, Msb,) aor. يَضِيمُهُ, (S,) inf. n.
ضَيْمٌ, (S, * Msb,) [as also ضَامَهُ, aor. يَضُومُهُ,
inf. n. ضَوٌْ, (see art. ضوم,)] He wronged him;
treated him wrongfully, unjustly, injuriously, or
tyrannically: (S:) he harmed, injured, hurt, or
damaged, him: (Msb:) and ↓ استضامهُ signifies
the same. (S.) And ضَامَهُ حَقَّهُ, (M, K,) aor. as
above, (K,) and so the inf. n., (M,) He defrauded him of his right, or due, partially or
wholly; (M, K;) as also ↓ استضامهُ. (K.) ―
-b2-
And ضُمْتُ I was wronged, &c.: of which there
are three dial. vars.; one says of a man ضِيمَ;
and ضُيْمَ, with [the pronunciation termed] إِشْمَام;
and ضُومَ; like as we have said respecting بِيعَ.
(S.) One says, مَا ضِمْتُ أَحَدً وَمَا ضُمْتُ [I have
not wronged any one, and I have not been wronged];
i. e. no one has wronged me. (TA.) It is said
in a trad., as some relate it, لَا تُضَامُونَ فِى رُؤْيَتِهِ
[or ↓ تُضَامُّونَ or ↓ تَضَامُّونَ Ye will not be
wronged in the seeing Him]. (M. [For other
readings and explanations of this trad., see 3 in
art. ضر.])

إِسْتَضْيَمَ see 1, in two places.
ضَيْمٌ Wrong; i. e. wrongdoing; or wrongful,
unjust, injurious, or tyrannical, treatment: (S,
K:) an inf. n. which is pluralized; its pl. being
ضُيُومٌ. (M, K.)
ضِيمٌ The side of a mountain, (S, M, K,) and
of an [eminence such as is termed] أَكَمَة. (M.)
ضَائِمٌ Wronging, or a wrongdoer: pl. ضَامَةٌ:
the latter occurring in the prov., تَأْتِى بِكَ الضَّامَةُ
عِرِّيسَ الأَسَدِ [The wrongdoers bring thee, or cause
thee to come, to the covert of the lion]; meaning,
the wrong of the wrongdoers requires thee to cast
thyself into destruction: applied in offering an
excuse for venturing upon that which is perilous:
or, as some relate it, الضَّامَّةُ, from الضَّمُّ; meaning
“ want, or the object of want, that brings thee
and causes thee to have recourse [to a thing]. ”
