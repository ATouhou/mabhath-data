ضبع1
ضَبَعَهُ, aor.
ضَبَعَ, (S, K,) inf. n. ضَبْعٌ, (TK,)
He (a man, S) stretched forth towards him (another man, S) his upper arm (ضَبْعَهُ), for the purpose of striking. (S, K.) A poet says,
وَلَا صُلْحَ حَتَّى تَضْبَعُوَنا وَنَضْبَعَا
i. e. [And there shall be no peace] until ye stretch
forth towards us your upper arms with the
swords and we stretch forth our upper arms
towards you: or, accord. to AA, until ye stretch
forth [towards us] your upper arms for the
making of peace and the joining of hands [and we
do the same]. (S.) And one says, ضَبَعَ يَدَهُ إِلَيْهِ
بِالسَّيْفِ, meaning He stretched forth his arm
towards him with the sword. (K.) And ضَبَعَ عَلَى
فُلَانٍ, (S, * K,) inf. n. as above, (TA,) He stretched
forth his upper arms for the purpose of uttering
an imprecation against such a one: (S, * K, TA:)
and hence, ضَبْعٌ is metaphorically used to signify
(tropical:)  the act of supplicating or imprecating; because
the person supplicating or imprecating raises his
hands and stretches forth his upper arms: and
ضِبَاعٌ, also, [app. an inf. n. of ↓ ضَابَعَ,] signifies
the raising the hands, or arms, in supplication or
imprecation. (TA.) And ضَبَعَتِ الخَيْلُ, and
الإِبِلُ, (S, Msb, K,) aor.
ضَبَعَ, (S, Msb,) inf. n. ضَبْعٌ
(S, K) and ضُبُوعٌ and ضَبَعَانٌ, (K,) The horses,
and the camels, stretched forth their arms (أَضْبَاعَهَا,
S, Msb, K, i. e. أَعْضَادَهَا, S, Msb) in their going
along; (S, Msb, K;) as also ↓ ضبّعت, inf. n.
تَضْبِيعٌ: (S, K:) in [a copy of] the A expl. as
meaning مَدَّتْ أَعْنَاقَهَا [stretched forth their necks;
but this is probably a mistranscription, for مدّت
أَعْضَادَهَا]: (TA:) ضَبَعَت said of horses is like
ضَبَحَت, (K, TA,) which is a dial. var.: (TA:)
and ضَبَعَت said of a she-camel, inf. n. ضَبْعٌ, signifies the same as ↓ ضبّعت, as also ↓ أَضْبَعَت, on
the authority of IKtt: (TA:) [or,] accord. to
As, ضَبْعٌ signifies the lifting, (S,) or bending,
(TA,) of the hoof, (S, TA,) by a horse, and the
lifting of the foot, by a camel, (TA,) towards the
arm: (S, TA:) or it signifies the running a pace
above that which is termed تَقْرِيب: (O, K:) or
ضَبَعَ said of a camel signifies he hastened, or was
quick, (K, TA,) in pace, or going: (TA:) or he
went along shaking his arms. (K.) ضَبَعَهُ also
signifies He (a camel) took him (another camel)
by his arms, and threw him down. (L in art.
عضد, and TA in the present art.) ―
-b2-  ضَبَعُوا لِلصُّلْحِ,
(K, TA,) and للْمُصَافَحَةِ; (TA;) or ضَبَعُوا إِلَى
الصُّلْحِ; and ضَبِعُوا, inf. n. ضَبَعٌ; (Et-Toosee,
TA;) They inclined to peace, (Et-Toosee, K, TA,)
and the joining of hands; they desired peace, &c.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  ضَبَعُوا لَنَا الطَّرِيقَ, (S, K,) or مِنَ الطَّرِيقِ,
inf. n. ضَبْعٌ, (TA,) They gave us a share of the road:
(S, K:) so says ISk: (S:) and in like manner one
says, ذَرَعُوا لَنَاطَرِيقًا. (TA.) And ضَبَعُوا الشَّىْءَ,
(K, TA,) or مِنَ الشَّىْءِ, (TA,) They gave a share
of the thing (K, TA) to every one. (TA.) ―
-b4-
And ضَبَعَ, (K,) inf. n. ضَبْعٌ, (TA,) He (a man)
acted wrongfully, unjustly, injuriously, or tyrannically: (K:) on the authority of Aboo-Sa'eed.
(TA.)
-A2-  ضَبِعَت, aor.
ضَبَعَ, inf. n. ضَبَعٌ (S, K) and
ضَبَعَةٌ; (S, * K; [this latter is said in the TA, on
the authority of IAar, to have been used by an
Arab of the desert in relation to a woman; and
is, accord. to the S, app., a simple subst.;]) and
↓ أَضْبَعَت, (S, K,) and ↓ استضبعت; (K;) She
(a camel) desired (S, K) vehemently (S) the stallion.
(S, K.)

ضَبَّعَ see above, in two places.
-A2-  ضبّع فُلَانًا He
intervened between him and the object at which he
desired to shoot or cast. (Ibn-'Abbád, O, K.)
-A3-
And ضبّع, inf. n. تَضْبِيعٌ, He was, or became,
cowardly, or weak-hearted: (Lth, K:) thus say
the vulgar; derived by them from الضَّبُعُ, because
this beast becomes still when one comes in upon
it, and then it goes forth. (Lth, TA.)
3
ضَابَعْنَاهُمْ بِالسُّيُوفِ We stretched forth our
arms towards them with the swords, they stretching
theirs forth towards us [therewith]: so in the
“ Nawádir ” of AA. (TA.) ―
-b2-  See also 1, in
the former half. ―
-b3-  [The inf. n.] مُضَابَعَةٌ also signifies The joining of hands; syn. مُصَافَحَةٌ. (TA.)

أَضْبَعَ see 1, near the middle of the paragraph:
-A2-
and also the last sentence of the same.
8
الاِضْطِبَاعُ, which the circuiter round the
House [of God, i. e. the Kaabeh,] is commanded
to perform, (S,) or in the case of the مُحْرِم, (K,)
is The putting the [garment called] رِدَآء under
one's right armpit, and turning back the extremity
thereof over his left [shoulder], exposing to view
his right shoulder [and arm] and covering the left;
(S, K, TA;) like the man that desires to labour
at a thing and prepares himself for doing so;
(TA;) thus termed because of exposing to view
one of the two upper arms: (S, K:) or the putting
one's garment (Mgh, Msb) under his right arm,
(Mgh,) or under his right armpit, (Msb,) and
throwing [a portion of] it upon his left shoulder:
(Mgh, Msb:) or the taking the إِزَار or the بُرْد,
and putting the middle of it under one's right
armpit, and throwing the extremity thereof upon
his left shoulder, over his breast and his back:
(IAth, TA:) التَّأَبُّطُ and التَّوَشُّحُ likewise signify
the same: so says Az: (Msb:) and so says As
of the former: (S:) and it is also written الاِطِّبَاعُ.
(Thus in the TA in explanation of التَّأَبُّطُ.) You
say, اِضْطَبَعَ بِثَوْبِهِ [He attired himself with his
garment in the manner described above]. (Mgh,
Msb.) And اضطبع الشَّىْءَ He put the thing under
his upper arms. (TA. [But accord. to the Mgh,
the verb is trans., correctly, only by means of بِ.])
10
إِسْتَضْبَعَ see 1, last sentence.
ضَبْعٌ The عَضُد [i. e. upper arm of a human
being, and arm of a quadruped], (S, Mgh, O,
Msb, K,) altogether: (K:) or the middle thereof,
(Lth, Mgh, O, K,) with its flesh: (O, K:) and
the inner side thereof: (Mgh:) or (so in some
copies of the K, but in others “ and,”) the armpit:
or the portion, of the upper part of the عَضُد, that
is between the armpit and the half of the former:
(K:) it is of man and of other than man: (TA:)
pl. أَضْبَاعٌ. (S, Msb, K.) One says, أَبَدَّ ضَبعَيْهِ,
[expl. in art. بد,] speaking of a man praying.
(O, TA.) And أَخَذْتُ بِضَبْعَىْ فُلَانٍ فَلَمْ أُفَارِقْهُ
and مَدَدْتُ بِضَبْعَيْهِ, meaning I seized the middle
of the upper arms of such a one [and did not
relinquish him]. (Lth, O, TA.) And جَذَبَهُ بِضَبْعَيْهِ
(tropical:)  He raised him, or set him up, and rendered his
name famous: and in like manner, أَخَذَ بِضَبْعَيْهِ,
and مَدَّ بِضَبْعَيْهِ. (TA.)
-A2-  Also Any [hill such as
is termed] أَكَمَة that is black and somewhat oblong.
(IAar, K.)
-A3-  ذَهَبَ بِهِ ضَبْعًا لَبْعًا means بَاطِلًا
[i. e., app., He took it away with a false pretence;
or in play, or sport]; (Ibn-'Abbád, O, K, TA;)
namely, a thing; (O, TA;) لَبْعًا being an imitative
sequent. (TA.)
-A4-  See also ضَبُعٌ.
-A5-  And see
what here next follows.
كُنَّا فِى ضُبْعِ فُلَانٍ (S, O, K) and فلان ↓ ضَبْعِ
and فلان ↓ ضِبْعِ (K) We were in the protection,
or quarter, (كَنَف, and نَاحِيَة,) of such a one. (S,
O, K: but in the K, هُوَ is put in the place of
كُنَّا.)
كُنَّا فِى ضِبْعِ فُلَانٍ: see what next precedes.
ضَبُعٌ (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K) and ↓ ضَبْعٌ, (Msb,
K,) the former of the dial. of Keys and the
latter of the dial. of Temeem, (Msb,) [The female
hyena; or the hyena, male and female;] a certain
animal of prey, (سَبُعٌ, [but see what follows,]) (K,)
well known, (S, O,) the worst, or most abominable,
of سِبَاع, (Mgh,) resembling the wolf, except that,
when it runs, it is as though it were lame, wherefore it is called العَرْجَآءُ: it flees from him who
holds in his hand a colocynth: [and they assert
that] the dogs bark not at him who retains with
him its teeth: if its skin is bound upon the belly
of her that is pregnant, she casts not her young:
if seed is measured in a measure covered with
its skin, the seed-produce is secure from the banes
thereof: and the application of its gall-bladder as
a collyrium sharpens the sight: (K:) it is not
reckoned among the hostile animals to which the
appellation of سَبُعٌ is applied, wherefore the
Sunneh allows that its flesh may be eaten, and
requires that a compensation be made for it [by
the sacrifice of a ram] if it be smitten [and killed]
in the sacred territory by a person in the state of
ihrám: (TA voce سَبُعٌ:) the word is of the fem.
gender, (S, * Mgh, * O, * Msb, K, *) and is [said to
be] applied peculiarly to the female; (Msb;) the
male being called ↓ ضِبْعَانٌ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,)
of which the pl. is ضَبَاعِينُ; (S, O, Msb, K;) but
AHát disapproved this pl.; (O;) and the female is
called [also] ↓ ضِبْعَانَةٌ, of which the pl. is ضِبْعَانَاتٌ;
(S, O, K;) or ضِبْعَانَةٌ has not been heard applied
to the female, but ضَبُعٌ only, and it seems that J
has mentioned ضِبْعَانَةٌ as applied to the female
from his having supposed ضِبْعَانَاتٌ to be pl. of
ضِبْعَانَةٌ, whereas it is pl. of ضِبْعَانٌ, being like
رِجَالَاتٌ and جِمَالَاتٌ: (IB in a marginal note in
one of my copies of the S:) but some say that
ضَبُعٌ or ضَبْعٌ is applied to the male; and the
female is termed ضَبْعَةٌ, thus with a quiescent
letter: (Msb:) or, accord. to Ibn-'Abbád, the
female is termed ضَبُعَةٌ, and its pl. [or rather the
coll. gen. n.] is ضَبُعٌ; (O, K;) or ضَبَعَةٌ is not
allowable: (S, K:) the pl. of ضَبُعٌ or ضَبْعٌ is
أَضْبُعٌ, (K,) a pl. of pauc., (TA,) and ضِبَاعٌ, (K,)
or the former is pl. of ضَبْعٌ, (Msb,) and the latter
is pl. of ضَبُعٌ, (Mgh, Msb,) and is of the male
and of the female, (S, K,) and ضُبُعٌ, (K,) as
though this were pl. of ضِبَاعٌ, (AAF, TA,) and
ضُبعٌ [a contraction of ضُبُعٌ] (K) and ضُبُعَاتٌ and
ضُبُوعَةٌ (TA [in which it is indicated that this last
is pl. of ضَبْعٌ]) and [quasi-pl. n.] ↓ مَضْبَعَةٌ. (O,
K.) One says أَمْدَرُ ↓ ضِبْعَانٌ, [in the CK, erroneously, ضَبْعَانُ,] meaning, [A male hyena] inflated in the sides, big in the belly: or, accord. to
some, whose sides are defiled with earth, or dust.
(S.) And سَيْلٌ جَارُّ الضَّبُعِ A torrent that draws
forth the ضَبُع from its den; (O, K; in the CK,
جارٌّ الصَّبُعَ;) hence meaning (assumed tropical:)  a torrent produced
by vehement rain. (TA.) And دَلْجَةُ الضَّبُعِ [The
night-journeying of the hyena]; because the ضَبُع
goes round about until midnight. (O, K.) And
مَا يَخْفَى ذٰلِكَ عَلَى الضَّبُعِ [That is not unapparent
to the hyena]: because the ضَبُع is deemed stupid.
(TA.) أَحْمَقُ مِنَ الضَّبُعِ [More stupid than the
hyena] is a prov. (Meyd.) And أَكَلَتْهُمُ الضَّبُعُ
(tropical:)  [The hyena devoured them] is said of such as are
held in mean estimation. (TA.) [But this may
be otherwise rendered, as will be seen from what
follows.] The saying of a poet,
تَفَرَّقَتْ غَنَمِى يَوْمًا فَقُلْتُ لَهَا
يَا رَبِّ سَلِّطْ عَلَيْهَا الذِئْبَ وَالضَّبُعَا
[My sheep, or goats, dispersed themselves, one day,
and I said in relation to them, O my Lord, set
upon them the wolf and the hyena], is said to
mean an imprecation, that the wolf might kill the
living of them, and the hyena devour the dead of
them: or, as some say, it means that the speaker
prayed for their safety; because, when both fall
upon the sheep, or goats, each of them is diverted
from the sheep, or goats, by the other; and thus
means the saying, اَللّٰهُمَّ ضَبُعًا وَذِئْبًا [O God, send
a hyena and a wolf]: but the more probable
meaning of the poet is an imprecation, the consequence of his anger and fatigue; and the word
سَلِّطْ imports a notification of this meaning. (IB,
TA.) ―
-b2-  [The pl.] الضِّبَاعُ is applied to (assumed tropical:)  Numerous stars below بَنَات نَعْش: (O, K:) or [the
stars beta, gamma, delta and mu, of Bootes; i. e.] the star
upon the head, and that upon [each of] the
shoulders, and that upon the club, of العَوَّآء: and
the name of أَوْلَادُ الضِّبَاعِ is given to [The stars
q, i, k, and l, app. with some other faint stars
around these, of Bootes; i. e.] the stars upon the
left hand and fore arm, and what surround the
hand, of the faint stars, of العَوَّآء. (Kzw.) ―
-b3-
الضَّبُعُ also signifies (tropical:)  The year of drought or
sterility or dearth; (S, IAth, O, Msb, K, TA;)
that is destructive; severe: of the fem. gender.
(TA.) So in a verse cited in art. اما [voce أَمَّا,
and again, with a variation, voce إِمَّا]. (S, O. [But
it is here said in the TA that الضَّبُعُ in this
instance means the animal of prey thus called.])
[Hence also,] it is related in a trad. of Aboo-Dharr, that a man said, يَا رَسُولَ اللّٰهِ أَكَلَتْنَا الضَّبُعُ
(tropical:)  [O Apostle of God, the year of drought has consumed us]: and he prayed for them. (TA.) [See
also two other exs. voce ذِئْبٌ.] ―
-b4-  Also (tropical:)  Hunger.
(Ibn-'Abbád, O, TA.) ―
-b5-  And (assumed tropical:)  Evil, or mischief.
(TA.) El-'Okeyleeyeh said, “When a man whose
evil, or mischief, we feared removed from us, we
used to light a fire behind him: ” and being asked
“ Why? ” she said, لِيَتَحَوَّلَ ضَبُعُهُ مَعَهُ, i. e. (assumed tropical:)  In
order that his evil, or mischief, might go away
with him. (IAar, TA.)
ضَبِعَةٌ A she-camel desiring [vehemently (see 1,
last sentence,)] the stallion; (Lth, K;) as also
↓ مُضْبِعَةٌ: (L, TA:) pl., accord. to the copies
of the K, ضَبَاعٌ and ضَبَاعَى; but in the L, ضِبَاعَى
and ضَبَاعَى: (TA:) and sometimes it is used in
relation to women. (K.)
ضِبْعَانٌ; and its fem., with ة: see ضَبُعٌ, in three
places.
ضَابِعٌ A she-camel stretching forth her arms
(أَضْبَاعَهَا, S, K, i. e. أَعْضَادَهَا, S) in going along:
(S, K:) or lifting her foot towards her arm in
going along: so accord. to an explanation by As
of the former of the two following pls.: (TA:)
the pl. is ضَوَابِعُ (Lth, As, TA) and ضُبَّعٌ. (TA.)
And A horse that runs vehemently; (O, K, TA;)
like ضَابِحٌ, of which the pl. is ضَوَابِحُ: (TA:) or
that runs much: (Lth, O, TA:) or that bends
his hoof towards his arm: (TA:) or that inclines
towards (lit. follows) one of his sides, and bends
his neck. (Ibn-'Abbád, O, K.)
أَضْبَعُ i. q. أَعْضَبُ [q. v.]; formed from the
latter by transposition. (TA.)
مَضْبَعَةٌ The portion of flesh that is beneath the
armpit, in the fore part. (O, K.)
-A2-  See also
ضَبُعٌ [of which it is a quasi-pl. n.].
مُضْبِعَةٌ: see ضَبِعَةٌ.
مُضَبَّعَةٌ A she-camel whose breast is prominent
and whose arms recede. (Ibn-'Abbád, O, K.)
حِمَارٌ مَضْبُوعٌ An ass devoured by the ضَبُع [or
hyena]: (O, K:) or [an ass which may the hyena
devour, for] accord. to some it means an imprecation that the ضبع may devour him. (TA.)
