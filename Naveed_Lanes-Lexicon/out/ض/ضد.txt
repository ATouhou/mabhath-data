-b2-  And ضَدَّهُ عَنْهُ He
averted him; turned him, or sent him, away, or
back; or caused him to return, or go back, or

ضادّهُ, (inf. n. مُضَادَّةٌ, Msb,) He, or it, was,
or became, contrary, opposed, or repugnant, to
him, or it; (AHeyth, S, * L, K;) said with
respect to two men when one desires what is

course, and the other, to pursue another:
(AHeyth, L:) or he, or it, was, or became,
separated from him, or it, by contrariety, opposition, or repugnance: (Msb:) [or, accord. to
the explanation of مُتَضَادَّانِ in the Msb, it was, or
became inconsistent with it.]
4
اضدّ He (a man, S) was, or became, angry.
(S, K.) It is not, as some assert it to be, a
quasi-pass. [of ضَدَّهُ], like as أَكَبَّ is of كَبَّهُ.
(TA.)

تَضَاْدَ3َ [تضادّا They two were, or became, contrary,
opposed, or repugnant, each to the other: or,
accord. to the explanation of مُتَضَادَّانِ in the Msb,
they two were, or became, inconsistent, each with
the other.]
ضِدٌّ (S, L, Msb, K) and ↓ ضَدِيدٌ (S, L, K) and
↓ ضَدِيدَةٌ (Th, M) The contrary, or opposite,
(AA, IAar, S, * M, Msb, K,) of a thing: (AA,
Msb:) or ضِدُّ شَىْءٍ signifies that which is repugnant to a thing, so that it would overcome it; as
black is to white, and death to life: (Lth, L:)
[or, accord. to the explanation of مُتَضَادَّانِ in the
Msb, that which is inconsistent with a thing:] pl.
of the first أَضَدَادٌ. (S, Msb, &c.) One says also,
هُوَ ضِدُّكَ and ↓ ضَدِيدُكَ He is contrary, or opposed,
or repugnant, to thee; as when thou desirest what
is long, and he, what is short; or thou, darkness,
and he, light; or thou, to pursue one course, and
he, to pursue another. (AHeyth, L.) And ضِدٌّ
is sometimes a pl., (K,) or sometimes denotes a
collective body; (Akh, S, L;) as in the phrase
يَكُونُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ ضِدًّا, (S, L, K,) in the Kur [xix.
85], (S, L,) meaning They shall be adversaries,
or enemies, to them: ('Ikrimeh, Jel:) or helpers
against them. (Fr, Jel.) One says also, القَوْمُ
عَلَىَّ ضِدٌّ وَاحِدٌ, meaning The people are assembled
together against me in contention, or altercation,
with me. (L.) ―
-b2-  ضِدٌّ in lexicology signifies A
kind of مُشْتَرَك [or homonym]; being a word that
has two contrary meanings; as جَوْنٌ, which
means both “ black ” and “ white; ” and جَلَلٌ,
which means both “ great ” and “ small ” pl. as
above. (Mz, 26th نوع.) [ضِدٌّ is itself a word of
this kind, as is shown by what here follows.]
―
-b3-  Also, (AA, Th, S, L, Msb, K,) and ↓ ضَدِيدٌ,
(S, L, K,) The like, or equal, (AA, Th, S, L,
Msb, K,) of a thing. (AA, Msb.) Thus they
have two contrary meanings. (K.) One says,
لَا ضِدَّ لَهُ and لَهُ ↓ لَا ضَدِيدَ There is no like, or
equal, to him, or it. (S, L.) And لَقِىَ القَوْمُ
أَضْدَادَهُمْ The people, or party, found, or met,
their equals, or fellows. (L.)
ضَدَدٌ: see ضَادٌّ.
ضَدِيدٌ: see ضَدٌّ, in four places.
ضَدِيدَةٌ: see ضِدٌّ, first sentence.
ضَادٌّ, or ↓ ضَادِدٌ and ↓ ضَدَدٌ One who fills
vessels for people when they seek, or demand,
water: pl. ضُدَدٌ, [which is anomalous,] on the
authority of AA. (L.)
ضَادِدٌ: see what next precedes.
هُمَا مُتَضَادَّانِ They two are contrary, opposed,
or repugnant, each to the other: (S, * L, K:) or
they two are inconsistent; or such as cannot be,
or exist, together; as night and day. (Msb.)
