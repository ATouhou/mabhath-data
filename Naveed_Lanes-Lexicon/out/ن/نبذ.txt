said that this word is originally of the measure
فَعِيلٌ in the sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ, but that
it has become obsolete in this latter sense, and,
applied to the beverage, is used as though it were
a primitive substantive, as is shown by the form
of its pl., (M, F,) which is أَنْبِذَةٌ; (S, L, MF;)
for a word of the measure فعيل in the sense of
the measure مفعول has not this form of pl.:
