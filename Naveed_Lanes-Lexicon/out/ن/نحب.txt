lots collectively: or sortilege itself;] (K;) from
نَاحَبَهَ “ he cited him before a judge; ” “ he contended with him for glory; ” and “ he laid a bet,

judge, or that which decides, in a case of sortilege.

سَارَ سَيْرًا مُنَحِّبًا He proceeded, or journeyed, in a
direct course, not desiring [to pursue] any other:
as though he had made a vow to do so. ElKumeyt says,
تَخَذْنَ بِنَا عَرْضَ الفَلَاةِ وَطُولَهَا
كَمَا صَارَ عَنْ يُمْنَى يَدَيْهِ المُنَحِّبُ
By المنحّب is meant the man. ISd says, Th
cites this verse, and says in explanation of it,
This was a man who swore, saying, If I do not
overcome, I will cut off my hand. He seems to
consider it as implying the signification of vowing.
So in the L. But it requires consideration.

-b2-  سِرْنَا إِلَيْهَا ثَلَاثَ لَيَالٍ مُنَحِّبَاتٍ We proceeded, or journeyed, thither during three nights
of laborious travelling. (TA.)
