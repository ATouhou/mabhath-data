Death: or a bier: or the term of existence: (K:)
or the death which God connects (يَنُوطُهُ) [with
one]: (IAar:) and if so, the ى is interchangeable
with و, (IAth, TA,) the word being originally
نَيْوِطٌ, then نَيِّطٌ, and then نَيْطٌ: (TA:) if a contraction, it is like هَيْنٌ and هَيِّنٌ, and لَيْنٌ and لَيِّنٌ.
(Az, TA.) You say, رَمَاهُ اللّٰهُ بِالنَّيْطِ, meaning
[God smote him, or may God smite him,] with
death: (S, in art. نوط, and TA:) or [may God
smite him] with the death which He connects [with
him]; as also رَمَاهُ اللّٰهُ بِنَيْطِهِ. (IAar.) And
أَتَاهُ نَيْطُهُ His term of existence came to him.
(TA.) And رُمِىَ فُلَانٌ فِى نَيْطِهِ Such a one was
cast into his bier; meaning, when he died. (TA.)
