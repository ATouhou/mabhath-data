نصر1
نَصَرَهُ, (M, A, K,) aor.
نَصُرَ, (M,) inf. n. نَصْرٌ
(M, A, K) and نُصْرَةٌ, (A,) or this is a simple
subst., (S, Msb,) and نُصُورٌ, (K,) [but see the
verse of Khidásh in what follows,] He aided or
assisted him, (M, K,) namely, a person wronged,
misused, or treated unjustly or injuriously, (M.
A, K,) against his enemy: (TA:) [he avenged
him: (see the verse here following, and see 8:)
he supplied his want, or somewhat thereof (TA.)
Kidásh Ibn-Zuheyr says.
فَإِنْ كُنْتَ تَشْكُو مِنْ خَلِيلٍ مَخَانَةً
فتِلْكَ الجَوَازِى عَقْبُهَا وَنُصُورُهَا
[And if thou complain of treachery from a friend.
those requitals are its result and its avengers, or
avengement]: here نُصُور may be a pl. of نَاصِرٌ.
like شُهُودٌ is of شَاهِدٌ; or it may be an inf. n.,
like دُخُولٌ and خُرُوجٌ. (M.) You say, تَصَرَهُ
عَلَى عَدُوِّهِ, (S, A, Msb,) and مِنْ عَدُوِّهِ, (A,
Msb,) aor.
نَصُرَ, (S, Msb,) inf. n. نَصْرٌ (S, A, Msb)
and نُصْرَةٌ, (A,) or this, as remarked above, is
a simple subst., (S, Msb.) He (namely, God.
S, A, or a man, Msb,) aided or assisted him, and
strengthened him, against his enemy: (Msb:)
[he avenged him of his enemy. (See 8.)] And
نَصَرَهُ اللّٰهُ God made him to be victorious, to
conquer, or to overcome: so in the Kur, xxii. 15,
where the pronoun relates to Mohammad. (TA.)
In the Kur, xlvii. 8. إِنْ تَنْصُرُوا اللّٰهَ يَنْصُرْكُمْ
means, If ye aid God's religion and his apostle,
He will aid you against your enemy: (Bd, Jel)
or if ye aid his servants, &c.: or if ye keep his
ordinances and aid his orders and comply with
his commands and shun the things which He hath
forbidden, &c. (El-Basáïr.) And the trad.
أُنْصُرْ أَخَاكَ ظَالِمَّا أَوْ مَظْلُومًا is explained as
meaning, Prevent thou thy brother from wronging when he is a wronger, and aid him against
his wronger when he is wronged. (TA.) Also,
نَصَرَهُ مِنْهُ, (K,) inf. n. نَصْرٌ and نُصْرَةٌ, (TA,) [or
the latter in this sense, as in the cases above
mentioned, is a simple subst.,] He served or
Preserved him from him or it. (K.) ―
-b2-  نَصَرَاللّٰهُ
الأَرْضَ God gave rain to the earth or land. (A.)
And نَصَرَ الغَيْثُ الأَرْضَ (S, M, K,) [aor.
نَصُرَ,]
inf. n. نَصْرٌ, (M,) (tropical:)  The rain aided the earth or
land: (S:) or watered it: (M:) or watered it
generally and copiously, (K, TA,) and caused it
to produce herbage: (TA:) and نَصَرَ البَلَدَ (tropical:)  it
assisted the country to produce abundance of
herbage: (TA:) and نُصِرَتِ الأَرْضْ (tropical:)  the earth
or land was watered by rain. (S.) ―
-b3-  Hence,
نَصَرَهُ, aor.
نَصُرَ, inf. n. نَصْرٌ, (tropical:)  He gave to him.
(M.) An Arab of the desert [in the A a beggar]
accosted a people saying, أُنْصُرُونِى نَصَرَكُمُ اللّٰهُ,
meaning, (tropical:)  Give ye to me: may God give to you.
(M, A.) ―
-b4-  نَصَرَهُ اللّٰهُ also signifies (assumed tropical:) God bestowed upon him the means of subsistence, or the
like; syn. رَزَقَهُ. (IKtt.)

نصّرهُ, (inf. n. تَنْصِيرٌ, K,) He made him a

[relating to the natural disposition of a child to

[But his two parents make him a Jew or make

See an ex. voce عَاصَرَ.]
5
تنصّر He laboured, or strove, to aid, or

to another, especially against an enemy: [avengement or another:] victory or conquest: (Bd,
xxix. 9:) and ↓ نُصْرَةٌ is a subst. from نَصَرَهُ [and
therefore signifies the same]: (S, Msb:) or the
↓ latter signifies good aid, or assistance: (M,
K:) and this ↓ same word, when the object is
God, signifies aid of God's servants; &c.; as
explained above: see 1. (El-Basáïr.) ―

plunder; booty. (Bd, ubi supra.) ―

See also نَاصِرٌ.

نُصْرَةٌ: see نَصْرٌ, in five places.
نَصْرِىٌّ: see نَصْرَانِىٌّ.
نَصْرَانٌ: see نَصْرَانِىٌّ.
نَصْرَانِىٌّ, (S, A, Msb, K, &c.) and ↓ نَصْرَانٌ,
(M, A,) or this latter has not been used without
the addition of the relative ى, (S,) or it has
been sometimes used, (M,) and ↓ نَصْرِىٌّ, (M,
Msb, K,) but we have not heard this used,
(M,) [A Christian: or this is a secondary application, and the original meaning is a Nazarene:] fem. نَصْرَانِيَّةٌ, (S, A, Msb, K,) and
نَصْرَانَةٌ, (S, A, K,) or the latter is used only
by poetic licence: (IB:) ↓ نَصَارَى [applied to
the Christians] is a rel. n. from نَاصِرَةُ, [or Nazareth,] a town of Syria, (S, M, K,) also called
نَصْرَانَةُ, (Lth, IDrd, K,) or نَصْرَانُ, (S, Msb,)
and نَصُورِيَةٌ, (M, Sgh, K,) without teshdeed,
accord. to Sgh, (TA,) and نُصْرِىٌّ and نُصْرَى,
(as in a copy of the M,) or نَصْرَى and نَصْرَوَةُ:
(TA:) so originally, and then applied to such
as hold the religion of its inhabitants: (Msb:)
this is the opinion of the lexicologists; but it is
of weak authority, though admissible as there
are other anomalous rel. ns.: (M:) or [so in
K, but in the S, and] نَصَارَى is pl. of نَصْرِىٌّ,
(Kh, M, Msb, K,) like as مَهَارَى is pl. of مَهْرِىٌّ;
(Msb, K;) or of نَصْرَانٌ (Kh, S, M) and نَصْرَانَةٌ,
(S,) like as نَدَامَى is pl. of نَدْمَانٌ (Kh, S, M)
and نَدْمَانَةٌ; (S;) but more probably of نَصْرَانٌ,
because this word has been sometimes used,
whereas we have not heard نَصْرِىٌّ used: (M:)
and it is implied in the copies of the K, that
أَنْصَارٌ is pl. of نَصْرَانِىٌّ; but correctly, it is a pl.
of نَصْرَانٌ, without ى, as is said in the TS, and
the L, in both of which is mentioned the saying
of the poet,
لَمَّا رَأَيْتُ نَبَطًا أَنْصَارَا
[When I saw Nabatheans, Christians], meaning
نَصَارَى. (TA.)

أَنْصَارٌ (S, M, A, Msb, K) and (of نَاصِرٌ, M)
نُصَّارٌ, (M, K,) and نُصُورٌ may also be a pl. of
the same, as occurring in the verse of Khidásh,
cited above: (M:) and أَنَاصِيرُ is a pl. pl., being

an epithet applied to them especially, (M, K,)
