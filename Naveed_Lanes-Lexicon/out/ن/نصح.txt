the saying of Aktham Ibn-Seyfee, إِيَّاكُمْ وَكَثْرَةَ

يَقُولُ انْتَصِحْنِى إِنَّنِى لَكَ نَاصِحٌ
[He says, Accept my sincere advice, for I am to
thee a sincere adviser]: (TA:) and إِنْتَصِحٌ
كِتَابَ اللّٰهِ Accept the sincere or faithful advice
or counsel of the Book of God. (A.) But IB
says, that the verb in this sense is intrans.; and
that, when trans., it signifies He took a person
as a نَصِيح [a sincere or faithful adviser or
counsellor, &c.]; whence the saying لَا أُرِيدُ مِنْكَ
نُصْحًا وَلَا انْتِصَاحا, i. e. لَا أُرِيدُ مِنْكَ أَنْ تَنْصَحَنِى

فَتَرَى القَوْمَ نَشَاوَى كُلَّهُمْ
مِثْلَمَا مُدَّتْ نِصَاحَاتُ الرُّبَحْ
(S, &c.) ربح here signifies, accord. to some, a

or such repentance that one returns not after it to
that of which he repents: (K:) sincere repentance, after which one returns not to sin: so
explained by Mohammad himself: (TA:) or
very sincere, or very honest repentance: (Zj:)
فَعُولٌ being a measure of an intensive epithet,
applicable alike to the masc. and fem.: (TA:)
or repentance in which one does not purpose to
return (K) to the sin of which he repents. (TA.)
