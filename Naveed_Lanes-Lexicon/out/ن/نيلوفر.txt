نيلوفرنِيلُوفَرٌ, (Msb,) and نَيْلُوفَرٌ, (Msb, and so in the
CK,) or نَيْلَوْفَرٌ, (so in copies of the K, and so
accord. to the TA,) or, as some say, نَيْنُوفَرٌ, or
نَيْنُوْفَرٌ, (accord. to different copies of the K,)
[The nymphæa, or lotus of Egypt and of Syria;]
a certain well-known plant; (Msb;) a kind of
sweet-smelling plant, which grows in stagnant
waters, (K, TA,) called by the people of Egypt
بشنين, [i. e. بَشْنِين,] and by the vulgar نَوْفَر;
(TA;) [both of which last names are now given
in Egypt to the nymphæa lotus, or white lotus,
found in the neighbourhoods of Rosetta and
Damietta; and the former, also, or perhaps both,
to the nymphæa cærulea, or blue lotus, found in
the same parts, and, until within a few years, in
a lake on the north of Cairo, called Birket erRatlee, whence I have twice procure roots of
this plant:] نيلوفر [written in Persian نِيلْپَرْ and
نِيلُوپَرْ and نِيلُوبَرْكْ &c.] is a Persian word
(أَعْجَمِيَّةٌ), and is said to be composed of نِيل, [or
indigo,] with which one dyes, and the name for
a wing, [i. e., پَرْ;] as though “ winged with نِيل
[or indigo]; ” because the leaf is as though its
two wings were dyed [with indigo]: (Msb:) the
plant so called is cold in the third degree, moist
in the second degree, emollient, good for cough
and for pains of the side and lungs and chest;
when its root, or lower part, (أَصْل,) is kneaded
with water, and used as a liniment, several times,
it removes the disease called البَهَق; and when
kneaded with زِفْت, it removes the disease called
دَآءُ الثَّعْلَبِ: (K, TA:) an excellent beverage is
also prepared from it. (TA.) The imám Bedred-Deen Mudhaffar, son of the Kádee of Baalabekk, says, in his book entitled Suroor en-Nefs,
that it is of many species; whereof [one or more]
in Syria, used in perfume; and a species in Egypt,
blue; and that its temperament is cold and moist
in the second degree; that the smelling it is useful
against hot diseases, and anxiety; and its juice
in like manner; and that the beverage prepared
from it is useful as a remedy for cough and
roughness [of the throat] and pain of the side
and chest, and is a laxative. The author of the
Irshád and that of the Moojiz also mention, that
the beverage prepared from it is an exception
from other sweet beverages inasmuch as it does
not become converted into yellow bile, which is
wonderful; and its oil is more cold and moist
than that of violets; and there is no flower more
cold and moist than it. Er-Rázee, too, says that
the smelling it is one of the causes of weakening
the generative faculty, and that the beverage is
one of the causes of stopping it; [for which purpose, or as an antiaphrodisiac, it is used in the
present day by some of the women of Cairo;]
notwithstanding which, it rejoices the heart, and
is useful for palpitation of the heart. This art. is
omitted by J and Sgh and the author of the L.
