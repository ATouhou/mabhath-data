last is extr., (M, TA,) He was, or became
avaricious, tenacious, or niggardly, of it, (S, M,

(TA.) You say, نَفِسَ عَلَيْهِ بِالشَّىْءِ, (M,) or عَنْهُ

also نافسهُ ↓ فِيهِ  ; of which last verb we have an
ex. in the phrase تُنَافِسُ دُنْيَا, used by a poet in
speaking of the tribe of Kureysh, meaning either
تُنَافِسُ فِى دُنْبَا [they think others not worthy of
worldly good]. or تُنَافسُ أَهْلَ دُنْيَا [they think

فُلَانٌ, meaning, Such a one inherited this before
such a one was born. (S.) ―
-b2-  Also, both these
verbs, (Msb, K,) or the latter, نَفِسَتْ, only, (Az,
Mgh, TA,) or the latter is the more common,
(K.) the former, which is related on the authority
of As, not being well known, (Msb,) (tropical:)  She (a
woman) menstruated. (Az, Mgh, Msb, K.) [In
the CK, a confusion is made by the omission of a

it are from نَفْسٌ meaning “ blood. ” (Mgh.)
-A4-
نَفَسْتُهُ بِنَفْسِ (tropical:)  I smote him with an [evil or envious]

تَنْفِيسٌ (S, Msb, K) and [quasi-inf. n.] نَفَسٌ, (K,)
(tropical:)  He (God) removed, or cleared away, his grief,
or sorrow, or anxiety: (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K *:)
and نفّس عَنْهُ signifies the same; (M, Mgh;) and
He made his circumstances ample and easy; (M,
TA;) and he (a man) eased him, or relieved him,
syn. رَفَّهَ: (S, TA:) and also, this last phrase, he
granted him a delay: the objective compliment
being omitted: and نَفِّسْنِى is used as meaning
grant thou to me a delay: or, elliptically, نَفِّسْ
كَرْبِى or غَمِّى [remove thou my grief, &c.].
(Mgh.) ―
-b2-  [Hence] حَرْفُ تَنْفِيسٍ, applied to the
prefix سَ [and its variants سَوْفَ &c.], meaning A
particle of amplification; because changing the
aor. from the strait time which is the present, to
the ample time, which is the future. (Mughnee,
in art. س.)
-A3-  نفّس القَوْسَ (tropical:)  He cracked the bow:
(Kr. M:) [see 5:] accord. to ISh, he put (حَطَّ)
its string [upon the bow]. (TA.)
3
نافس فِى الشَّىْءِ, (S, K. *) inf. n. مُنَافَسَةٌ and
نِفَاسٌ, (S,) He desired the thing, [or aspired to it.]

they desired it with emulation; syn. فَراغَبَوا: (A,

in request; or in great request:] or مُنَافَسَهٌ and
↓ تَنَافُسٌ signify the desiring to have a thing, and
to have it for himself exclusively of any other
person; from نَفِيسٌ, signifying a thing “ good, or
goodly, or excellent, in its kind: ” (TA:) and
تَنَافَسْنَا ذٰلِكَ الأَمْرَ and تنافسنا فيه we envied one
another for that thing, and strove for priority in
attaining it. (M.) See also تَفِسَ عَلَيْهِ الشَّىْءَ,
with which نَافَسَهُ فِيهِ is syn. (M.)
4
انفس: see نَفُسَ, in two places.

(a thing, TA) pleased him, (K, TA,) and made
him desirous of it: (TA:) or became highly
esteemed by him. (IKtt.) ―

copy of the A.)
-A3-  مَا أَنْفَسَهُ How powerful is his
evil, or envious, eye! (Lh, M.)
5
تنفّس [He breathed] is said of a man and of
every animal having lungs: (S:) [or it signifies]
he drew (اِسْتَمَدَّ) breath: (M:) or [he respired,
i. e.] he drew breath with the air-passages in his
nose; to his inside, and emitted it. (Msb.) You
say also, تنفّس الصُّعَدَآءَ [He sighed: see also art.
صعد]. (S.) ―
-b2-  (tropical:)  He (a man) emitted wind from
beneath him. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Also, (TA,) or تنفّس
فِى الإِنَآءِ, (K,) (tropical:)  He drank (K, TA) from the
vessel (TA) with three restings between draughts,
and separated the vessel from his mouth at every
such resting: (K, TA.) and, contr., the latter
phrase, (assumed tropical:)  he drank [from the vessel] without
separating it from his mouth: (K, TA:) which
latter mode of drinking is disapproved. (TA.)
―
-b4-  Also تنفّس (assumed tropical:)  He lengthened in speech; he spoke
long; for when a speaker takes breath, it is easy
to him to lengthen his speech; and تنفس فِى
الكَلَامِ signifies the same. (TA.) ―
-b5-  (tropical:)  It (said
of the day, M, A, and of the dawn, A, and of
other things, M) became extended; (M;) it
became long; (M, A;) or, said of the day, accord.
to Lh, it advanced so that it became noon: (M:)
or it increased: (S:) and it extended far: and
hence it is said of life, meaning either it became
protracted, and extended far, or it became ample:
(M:) and, said of the dawn, it shone forth, (Akh,
S, K, TA,) and extended so that it became clear
day: (Fr, TA:) or it broke, so that things became
plain in consequence of it: (TA:) or it rose:
(Mujáhid:) or its dusty hue shone at the approach
of a gentle wind. (Bd, lxxxi. 18.) You say also,
تنفّس بِهِ العُمُرُ (tropical:)  [Life became long, or protracted,
&c., with him]. (A.) And تنفّست دِجْلَةُ (assumed tropical:)  The
water of the Tigris increased. (TA.) ―

in the same sense is said of an arrow. (M.)
-A2-
[تنفّس عَلَيْهِ الشَّىْءَ app. signifies the same as نَفِسَ
عليه الشىء, q. v.]
6
تَنَاْفَسَ see 3, throughout.
نَفْسٌ The soul; the spirit; the vital principle;
syn. رُوحٌ: (S, M, A, Msb, K:) but between
these two words is a difference [which must be
fully explained hereafter, though ISd says, that
it is not of the purpose of his book, the M, to
explain it]: (M:) in this sense it is fem.:
(Msb:) pl. [of pauc.] أَنْفُسٌ and [of mult.] نُفُوسٌ.
(M, Msb.) You say, خَرَجَتْ نَفْسُهُ [His soul,
or spirit, went forth]; (Aboo-Is-hák, S, M, Msb,
K;) and so جَادَتْ نَفْسُهُ. (Msb.) And a poet
says, not Aboo-Khirásh as in the S, but Hudheyfeh Ibn-Anas, (IB,)
نَجَا سَالِمٌ والنَّفْسُ مِنْهُ بِشِدْقِهِ
وَلَمْ يَنْجُ إِلَّا جَفْنَ سَيْفٍ وَمِئْزَرَا
i. e., [Sálim escaped when the soul was in the side
of his mouth; but he escaped not save] with the
scabbard of a sword and with a waist-wrapper.
(S.) In the same sense the word is used in the
saying. فِى نَفْسِ فُلَانٍ أَنْ يَفْعَلَ كَذَا وَكَذَا [but
this seems rather to mean, It is in the mind of
such a one to do so and so]. (Aboo-Is-hák, M.)
Some of the lexicologists assert the نَفْس and
the رُوح to be one and the same, except that
the former is fem., and the latter [generally or
often] masc.: others say, that the latter is
that whereby is life; and the former, that
whereby is intellect, or reason; so that when
one sleeps, God takes away his نفس, but not
his روح, which is not taken save at death: and
the نَفْس is thus called because of its connexion
with the نَفَس [or breath]. (IAmb.) Or every
man has نَفْسَانِ [two souls]: (I'Ab, Zj:) نَفْسُ
العَقْلِ [the soul of intellect, or reason, also called
النَّفْسُ النَّاطِقَةُ (see رُوحٌ)], whereby one discriminates, [i. e., the mind,] (I'Ab,) or نَفْسُ التَّمْيِيزِ
[the soul of discrimination], which quits him
when he sleeps, so that he does not understand
thereby, God taking it away: (Zj:) and نَفْسُ
الرُّوحِ [the soul of the breath], whereby one lives,
(I'Ab,) or نَفْسُ الحَيَاةِ [the soul of life], and
when this quits him, the breath quits with it;
whereas the sleeper breathes: and this is the
difference between the taking away of the نفس
of the sleeper in sleep and the taking away of
the نفس of the living [at death.] (Zj.) Much
has been said respecting the نَفْس and the رُوح;
whether they be one, or different: but the truth
is, that there is a difference between them, since
they are not always interchangeable: for it is
said in the Kur, [xv. 29 and xxxviii. 72,]
وَنَفَخْتُ فِيهِ مِنْ رُوحِى [And I have blown into
him of my spirit.]; not مِنْ نَفْسِى: and [v. 116,]
تَعْلَمُ مَا فِى نَفْسِى [to be explained hereafter];
not فِى رُوحِى, nor would this expression be well
except from Jesus: and [lviii. 9,] وَيَقُولُونَ فِى
أَنْفُسِهِمْ [And they say in their souls, or within
themselves]: for which it would not be well to
say فِى أَرْوَاحِهِمْ: and [xxxix. 57,] أَنْ تَقُولَ نَفْسٌ
[That a soul shall say]; for which no Arab
would say أَنْ تَقُولَ رُوحٌ: hence, the difference
between them depends upon the considerations
of relation: and this is indicated by a trad., in
which it is said that God created Adam, and
put into him a نَفْس and a رُوح; and that from
the latter was his quality of abstaining from
unlawful and indecorous things, and his understanding, and his clemency, or forbearance, and
his liberality, and his fidelity; and from the
former, [which is also called النَّفْسُ الأَمَّارَةُ, q. v.,
in art. أمر,] his appetence, and his unsteadiness,
and his hastiness of disposition, and his anger:
therefore one should not say that نَفْسٌ is the
same as رُوحٌ absolutely, without restriction, nor
رُوحٌ the same as نَفْس. (R.) The Arabs also
make the discriminative نَفْس to be two; because
it sometimes commands the man to do a thing or
forbids him to do it; and this is on the occasion
of setting about an affair that is disliked: therefore they make that which commands him to
be a نفس, and that which forbids him to be as
though it were another نفس: and hence the
saying, mentioned by Z, فُلَانٌ يُؤَامِرُ نَفْسَيْهِ (tropical:)  [Such
a one consults his two souls, or minds]; said of a
man when two opinions occur to him. (TA.)
[بِنَفْسِى فُلَانٌ is an elliptical phrase sometimes
used, for بِنَفْسِى فُلَانٌ مَفْدِىٌّ, which see in art.
فدى.] ―
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  A thing's self; (S, M, A, K, TA;)
used as a corroborative; (S, TA;) its whole,
(Aboo-Is-hák, M, TA,) and essential constituent:
(Aboo-Is-hák, M, A, K, TA:) pl. as above,
أَنْفُسٌ and نُفُوسٌ. (M.) You say, رَأَيْتُ فُلَانًا نَفْسَهُ
(assumed tropical:)  I saw such a one himself, (S,) and جَآءَنِى بِنَفْسِهِ
[or, more properly, حَآءَنِى هُوَ بِنَفْسِهِ (see, under
the head of بِ, a remark on that preposition
when used in a case of this kind, redundantly,)]
He came to me himself. (S, K.) And وَلِىَ
الأَمْرَ بِنَفْسِهِ [He superintended, managed, or conducted, the affair in his own person]. (K, in art.
بشر, &c.) And حَدَّثَ نَفْسَهُ [He talked to himself;
soliloquized]. (Msb, in art. بلو; &c.) And
قَتَلَ فُلَانٌ نَفْسَهُ (assumed tropical:)  [Such a one killed himself]:
and أَهْلَكَ نَفْسَهُ (assumed tropical:)  made his whole self to fall into
destruction. (Aboo-Is-hák, M.) And hence,
(TA,) from نَفْسُ الشَّىْءِ signifying ذَاتُهُ, (M,)
the saying mentioned by Sb, نَزَلْتُ بِنَفْسِ الجَبَلِ
(assumed tropical:)  [I alighted in the mountain itself]: and نَفْسُ
الجَبَلِ مُقَابِلِى (assumed tropical:)  [The mountain itself is facing
me]. (M, TA.) [Hence also the phrase] فِى
نَفْسِ الأَمْرِ [meaning (assumed tropical:)  in reality; in the thing
itself]: as in the saying, قَلَّلَهُ فِى نَفْسِهِ وَإِنْ لَمْ
يَكُنْ قَلِيلًا فِى نَفْسِ الأَمْرِ (assumed tropical:)  [He held it to be little
in his mind though it was not little in reality].
(Msb, art. قل.) The words of the Kur, [v. 116,]
تَعْلَمُ مَا فِى نَفْسِى وَلَا أَعْلَمُ مَا فِى نَفْسِكَ mean
(assumed tropical:)  Thou knowest what is in myself, or in my
essence, and I know not what is in thyself, or
in thine essence: (Bd, K:) or Thou knowest
what I conceal (M, Bd, Jel) in my نفس [or
mind], (Bd, Jel,) and I know not what is in
thyself, or in thine essence, nor that whereof Thou
hast the knowledge, (M.) or what Thou concealest
of the things which Thou knowest; (Bd, Jel;)
so that the interpretation is, Thou knowest what
I know, and I know not what Thou knowest:
(M:) or نفس is here syn. with عِنْد; and the
meaning is, تَعْلَمُ مَا عِنْدِى وَلَا أَعْلَمُ مَا عِنْدَكَ;
(K, * TA;) [i. e., Thou knowest what is in my
particular place of being, and I know not what
is in thy particular place of being; for] the
adverbiality in this instance is that of مَكَانَة, not
of مَكَان: (TA:) but the best explanation is
that of IAmb, who says that نفس is here syn.
with غَيْب; so that the meaning is, Thou knowest
غَيْبِى [my hidden things, or what is hidden from
me, and I know not thy hidden things, or what
Thou hidest]; and the correctness of this is
testified by the concluding words of the verse,
إِنَّكَ أَنْتَ عَلَّامُ الغُيُوبِ [for Thou art he who well
knoweth the hidden things]: (TA:) [and here
it must be remarked that] العَيْبُ, which occurs
afterwards in the K as one of the significations
of النَّفْسُ, is a mistake for الغَيْبُ, the word used
by IAmb in explaining the above verse. (TA.)
―
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  A person; a being; an individual; syn.
شَخْصٌ; (Msb;) a man, (Sb, S, M, TA,)
altogether, his soul and his body; (TA;) a living
being, altogether. (Mgh, Msb.) In this sense
of شخص it is masc.: (Msb:) or, accord to Lh,
the Arabs said, رَأَيْتُ نَفْسًا وَاحِدَةً (assumed tropical:)  [I saw one
person], making it fem.; and in like manner,
رَأَيْتُ نَفْسَيْنِ ثِنْتَيْنِ (assumed tropical:)  [I saw two persons]; but
they said, رَأَيْتُ ثَلَاثَةَ أَنْفُسٍ (assumed tropical:)  [I saw three
persons], and so all the succeeding numbers,
making it masc.: but, he says, it is allowable
to make it masc. in the sing. and dual., and fem.
in the pl.: and all this, he says, is related on the
authority of Ks: (M:) Sb says, (M.) they said
ثَلَاثَةُ أَنْفُسٍ, (S, M,) making it masc., (S,) because
they mean by نفس “ a man,” (S, M,) as is
shown also by their saying نَفْسٌ وَاحِدٌ: (M:)
but Yoo asserts of Ru-beh, that he said ثَلَاثُ
أَنْفُسٍ, making نفس fem., like as you say ثَلَاثُ
أَعْيُنٍ, meaning, of men; and ثَلَاثَةُ أَشْخُصٍ,
meaning, of women: and it is said in the Kur,
[iv. l, &c.,] اَلَّذِى خَلَقَكُمْ مِنْ نَفْسٍ وَاحِدَةٍ (assumed tropical:)  [who
created you from one man], meaning, Adam.
(M.) You also say, مَا رَأَيْتُ ثَمَّ نَفْسًا (assumed tropical:)  I saw
not there any one. (TA.) ―
-b4-  (assumed tropical:)  A brother: (IKh,
IB:) a copartner in religion and relationship:
(Bd, xxiv. 61:) a copartner in faith and religion.
(Ibn-'Arafeh.) (assumed tropical:)  It is said in the Kur, [xxiv. 61,]
فَإِذَا دَخَلْتُمْ بُيُوتًا فَسَلِّمُوا عَلَى أَنْفُسِكُمْ And
when ye enter houses, salute ye your brethren:
(IB:) or your copartners in religion and relationship. (Bd.) And in verse 12 of the same chapter.
بِأَنْفُسِهِمْ means (assumed tropical:)  Of their copartners in faith and
religion. (Ibn-'Arafeh.) ―
-b5-  (tropical:)  Blood: (S, M, A,
Mgh, Msb, K:) [or the life-blood: in this sense,
fem.:] pl. [of pauc. أَنْفُسٌ and of mult.] نُفُوسٌ: (IB:)
so called [because the animal soul was believed
by the Arabs, as it was by many others in
ancient times, (see Gen. ix. 4, and Aristotle, De
Anim. i. 2, and Virgil's Æn. ix. 349.) to diffuse
itself throughout the body by means of the
arteries: or] because the نَفْس [in its proper
sense, i. e. the soul,] goes forth with it: (TA:)
or because it sustains the whole animal. (Mgh,
Msb.) You say, سَالَتْ نَفْسُهُ (tropical:)  [His blood flowed].
(S.) And نَفْسٌ سَائِلَةٌ (tropical:)  [Flowing blood]. (S, A,
Mgh.) And دَفَقَ نَفْسَهُ (tropical:)  He shed his blood. (A,
TA.) ―
-b6-  (tropical:)  The body. (S, A, K.) ―
-b7-  (assumed tropical:)  [Sometimes it seems to signify The stomach. So in
the present day. You say, لَعِبَتْ نَفْسُهُ, meaning
He was sick in the stomach. See غَثَتْ نَفْسُهُ, in
art. غثى; and مَذِرَتْ مَعِدَتُهُ and نَفْسُهُ, in art.
مذر.] ―
-b8-  (assumed tropical:)  [The pudendum: so in the present
day: in the K, art. حشو, applied to a woman's
vulva.] ―
-b9-  [From the primary signification are
derived several others, of attributes of the
rational and animal souls; and such are most of
the signification here following.] ―
-b10-  (assumed tropical:)  Knowledge. (A.) [See, above, an explanation of the
words cited from ch. v. verse 116 of the Kur-án.]

M, A, K, TA,) that smites the person or thing at
which it is cast: pl. أَنْفُسٌ. (TA.) [See 1, last
signification.] So in a trad., in which it is said,
that the نَمْلَة and the حُمَة and the نَفْس are the
only things for which a charm is allowable.
(TA.) You say, أَصَابَتْ فُلَانًا نَفْسٌ (tropical:)  [An evil
or envious eye smote such a one]. (S.) And
Mohammad said, of a piece of green fat that he
threw away, كَانَ فِيهَا سَبْعَةُ أَنْفُسٍ, meaning,
(tropical:)  There were upon it seven [evil or envious] eyes.
(TA.) ―

in the Kur, [iii. 27 and 28, meaning, And God
maketh you to fear his punishment]; accord. to
F; but others say that the meaning is, Himself.
(TA.)
-A3-  A quantity (S, M, K,) of قَرَظ, and
of other things, with which hides are tanned, (S,
K,) sufficient for one tanning: (S, M, K:) or
