north, or northerly, wind, (الشَّمَال): (AZ, K:)
that between the south, or southerly, and east, or
easterly, winds, being called جِرْبِيَاءُ: (AZ:) [but
see this word, and see below:] or what are
termed نُكْبُ الرِّيَاحِ [نُكْبٌ being pl. of نكباء] are
four: (IAar, Th, S, K:) namely, first, the نكباءُ
الصَّبَا وَالجَنُوبِ the wind that blows in a direction
between that of the east, or easterly, and that of
the south, or southerly, wind; also called الأَزْيَبُ;
(S, K;) which is a very thirsty wind, that dries
up much the leguminous plants; but Et-Tará-
bulusee, in the Kf, and Mbr and IF, assert that
the ازيب is the جنوب; not its نكباء: (TA:)
second, the نكباءُ الصَّبَا وَالشَّمَالِ the wind that
blows in a direction between that of the east, or
easterly, and that of the north, or northerly, wind;
also called الصَّابَيةُ, and called also ↓ النُّكَيْباَءُ, (S, K,)
a diminutive meant to convey the opposite of a
diminutive sense; for they find this wind to be
very cold; (S;) it is very boisterous and very
cold; unattended by rain or by any good: (TA:)
third, the نكباءُ الشَّمَالِ وَالدَّبُورِ the wind that blows
in a direction between that of the north, or
northerly, and that of the west, or westerly, wind;
also called الجِرْبِيَاءُ; and termed نَيِّحَةُ الأَزْيَبِ the
opposite wind to the ازيب; (S, K;) a cold wind;
(S;) and sometimes attended by a little rain;
but Ibn-El-Ajdábee asserts that the جربياء is the
شمال: (TA:) fourth, the نكباءُ الجَنُوبِ والدَّبُورِ the
wind that blows in a direction between that of the
south, or southerly, and that of the west, or
westerly, wind; also called الهَيْفُ; (in the CK,
الهَيَفُ;) and termed نَيِّحَةُ النُّكَيْباَءِ the opposite wind
to the نكيباء; (S, K;) a hot wind (S) and very
thirsty. (TA.) Accord. to Ibn-Kubás, the tract
whence blows the نكباء [by which he means only
the wind that blows from the north-east or thereabout] is that extending between the point where
rises the ذِرَاع [or the asterism composed of the
stars a and b of Gemini, E. 33 degrees N., in central
Arabia; or a and b of Canis Minor, E. 7 degrees N.,
in the same latitude] and the pole-star: and the
tract between the pole-star and the point where
sets the ذراع is the tract whence blows the شمال.
Sh says, Each of the four [cardinal] winds has
its نكباء, which is called in relation to it: that of
the صبا is that which is between it and the شمال;
[blowing from the north-east, or thereabout;] and
it resembles it in gentleness; sometimes having
sharpness, or vehemence; but this is seldom;
only once in a long space of time: that of the
شمال is that which is between it and the دبور;
[blowing from the north-west, or thereabout;] and
it resembles it in coldness: it is called الشمالُ
الشَّامِيَّةُ: each of them is called by the Arabs
شاميّة: that of the دبور is that which is between it
and the جنوب; blowing from the point where sets
سُهَيْل [or Canopus; i. e., S. 29 degrees W., in the latitude
of central Arabia]; and it resembles it in its
violence and boisterousness: and that of the جنوب
is that which is between it and the صبا; [blowing
from the south-east, or thereabout;] and it is the
wind most resembling it in its softness and in its
gentleness in winter. (L.) The pl. of نكباء is
نُكْبٌ, as shown above. (S, K &c.) [See also
تَبُّوعُ الشَّمْسِ, in art. تبع.] ―

and the [tendon called] حَبْلُ العَاتِقِ, in a man
and a bird and any other thing. (TA.) [It seems
to be regarded by some as originally signifying
“ a place of deflection: ” but] Sb denies its
being a noun of place, because, were it so, it
would be مَنْكَبٌ: he does not allow it to be
included in the class of مَطْلِعٌ, because this is
extr. Pl. مَنَاكِبُ. رَجُلٌ شَدِيدُ المَنَاكِبِ, signifies

joint, and the pl. to denote the whole. (TA.)
