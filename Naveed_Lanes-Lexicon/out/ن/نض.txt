TA,) i. e. what was apparent of his property,
(TA,) became much, or abundant. (K, TA.)
-A2-
He moved about his tongue; as also تَصْنَصَ; but
the ض in the former is not a substitute for the
ص in the latter, as some assert it to be: (L,
TA:) the verb is used in this sense in speaking of a man; (TA:) and of a serpent; (S *,
A, K;) inf. n. نَضْنَضَةٌ: (S, but in one copy
نَضِيضَةٌ:) and accord. to Ibn-'Abbád, نَضْنَضَةٌ [the
inf. n.] signifies the making, or uttering, of a
sound: or the sound itself; (صَوْت;) [app. by a
motion of the tongue;] of the serpent; and hence,
[accord. to some,] the epithet نَضْنَاضٌ, as applied
to a serpent: (TA:) or this epithet is from the
phrase, (IAar.) نَصْنَضَ فُلَانًا, (IAar, K,) ↓ نَضَّضَهُ,
(so in the CK,) He put such a one in motion,
(IAar,) and he disquieted, disturbed, or unsettled,
him; or removed him from his place. (IAar,
K.) [In one place, in the TA, اسنضّ مِنْهُ شَيْئًا
is made to signify the same; but this is doubtless
a mistake, arising from an omission in transcription.] You say also, نَضْنَضَ البَعِيرُ ثَفنَاته The
camel moved about his ثَفِنَات [q. v.], and made
them to be in contact with the ground; or this is
[نَصْنَصَ,] with ص. (TA.)

Msb, K) (tropical:)  Gold and silver coin or money; or

are called المَال ↓ نَاضٌّ: (A, TA:) or the dirhem
and deenár: (K:) of the dial. of El-Hijáz:
(As, S, Mgh, Msb:) but accord. to A 'Obeyd,
(S, Msb,) or As, (TA,) these are called ↓ نَاضٌّ
only when converted into such after having been
a commodity, or commodities; (S, Msb, K;)
because one says, مَا نَضَّ بِيَدِى مِنْهُ شَىْءٌ, (S,
Msb,) i. e. مَا حَصَلَ: (Msb:) نَضٌّ also signifies
what is apparent, or produced, or prepared, or
ready; and so ↓ نَاضٌّ, particularly of property:
(TA:) and ↓ the latter, what has continuance,
or endurance, of property, (Msb.) A man of
much property is described as being أَكْثَرُ النَّاسِ
↓ نَاضًّا (tropical:)  [The most abounding of men in gold and
silver coin]. (TA.)

which is a mistake. TA.) Also, A small
quantity of milk. (S. K.) ―

(assumed tropical:)  A man having little flesh; (K;) as also ↓ نَضُّهُ,

[Hence,] نُضَاضَةُ وَلَدِ الرَّجُلِ (tropical:)  The last of the
children of the man: (AZ, S, A, K:) applied

وَهِىَ ذَاتُ نَضِيضَةٍ, and ذَاتُ نَضَائِضَ, The camels
have left the water, having thirst; (S, K.; *)
not having satisfied their thirst. (S.)
-A2-  The
sound of the roasting of flesh-meat upon heated
stones: pl. نَضَائِضُ: (S, K:) ISd, however, says,
I think that نَضَائضُ is a sing., like خَشَارِمُ; but
the sing. may be نَضِيضَةٌ. (TA.) [It seems to
me not improbable that نَضَائِضُ may in a mistranscription, for نَضَائِضُ, pl. of the inf. n. نَضْنَضَةٌ
used as a subst.]
-A3-  See also نَضِيضٌ.
نَضْنَاضٌ: see نَضِيضٌ.

forth; (K;) as also with ص: [see نَصْنَاصٌ:]

respecting the meaning of نَضْناضٌ, did nothing
more than move about his tongue in his mouth;
(S:) or put forth his tongue, and move it about,
(IJ, O,) in his mouth, making a sign with it to
him who asked him. (O.)
