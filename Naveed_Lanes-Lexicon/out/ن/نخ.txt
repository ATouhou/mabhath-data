نَخَّةٌ or ↓ نُخَّةٌ or ↓ نِخَّةٌ, as occurring in the
following words of a trad., لَيْسَ فِى النخّةِ صَدَقَةٌ,
[No alms are required by the law in the case of
....,] is variously explained. (TA.) It is said
that نَخَّةٌ signifies Slaves, (AO, Az, S, K,) men
and women: (AO, Az:) also, a [single] male
slave: (ISh:) also, working bulls or cows; (S,
K;) and so نُخَّةٌ: (K:) Th says that this is the
correct meaning, because it is from نَخٌّ, signifying
the “ act of driving vehemently; ” and Ks says
that this is its meaning, but that it is only نُخَّةٌ,
with damm: (S:) also, asses, حُمُرٌ, [in the CK,
خَمْرٌ,] (IAar, L, K,) collectively; (L;) and so
نُخَّةٌ (L, K) and نِخَّةٌ: (K:) also, [animals] reared
in houses or tents: (K:) also, whatever are employed in labour, of camels, and bulls or cows, and
asses, and slaves; as also نُخَّةٌ: (Aboo-Sa'eed:)
also, pastors; and so نُخَّةٌ: also, drivers, leaders,
or attendants, of camels: (K:) also, the taking
of a deenár for himself by the collector of the alms
required by the law, called صَدَقَة, (S, K,) after
he has finished receiving those alms: (S:) also,
the deenár itself so taken is thus called. (K.) In
all these senses the word نخّة is explained in the
above trad. (TA.)
