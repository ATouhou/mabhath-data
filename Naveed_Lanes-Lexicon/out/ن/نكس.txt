accord. to the reading of 'Ásim and Hamzeh,
↓ نُنَكِّسْهُ; meaning, And him whom We cause to
live long, We cause him to become in a state the
reverse of that in which he was, in constitution;
so that after strength, he becomes reduced to
weakness; and after youthfulness, to extreme old
age. (TA.) ―

readings; ↓ نُكِّسُوا, and نَكَسُوا; the latter meaning نَكَسُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ: (Bd;) or (assumed tropical:)  then they reverted
from what they knew, of the evidence in favour
of Abraham. (Fr.) ―

face, or the like, (see art. تعس,) and relapse into
disease: or] may he fall upon his face, and not
rise after his fall until he fall a second time: and
in like manner you say, ↓ تَعَسَ وَانْتَكَسَ. (Msb, art.
تعس.) [See also 8.] You say also, نُكِسَ الجُرْحُ

This last signification [understood figuratively]
it is said to have in the phrase تَعَسَ وَانْتَكَسَ, a

who is overthrown in his affair (مَن انْتَكَسَ فِى
أَمْرِهِ) is disappointed of attaining his desire, and
suffers loss. (TA.) [See also 1, where this
form of imprecation is differently explained.] ―

-b4-  قَرَأَ القُرَآنَ مَنْكُوسًا He read or recited,
the Kur-án, beginning from the last part thereof,
(K,) i. e. from [the commencement of the latter
of] the مُعَوِّذَتَانِ [or last two chapters], (TA,)
and ending with the فَاتِحَة [or first chapter];
contrary to the prescribed mode: (TA:) or
beginning from the end of the chapter, and
reading it, or reciting it, to its beginning, invertedly; (K;) a mode which A 'Obeyd thinks
impossible; and therefore he holds the former
explanation to be the right: (TA:) each of
these practices is disapproved, excepting the
former in teaching children, [in which case it is
generally adopted in the present day,] (K,) and
[in teaching] the foreigner the [portion of the
Kur-án called the] مُفَصَّل; an indulgence being
granted to these two only because the long
chapters are difficult to them: but if any one
knows the Kur-án by heart, and intentionally
recite it from the last part thereof to the first,
this is forbidden: and if we disapprove this,
still more is the reciting from the end of the
chapter to the beginning disapproved, if the doing
this be possible. (TA.) ―
