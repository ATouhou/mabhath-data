The people contended together in the mutual

“ Shall I guide thee to booty and one fifth of it
be for me? ” and he answered, “Yes: ” so he
guided him to some people from El-Yemen, and
Sakhr made a sudden attack upon them, and
engaged with them in conflict, and overcame, and
obtained booty; and when he turned back,
El-Hárith said to him the above words, and
Sakhr fulfilled his promise to him. (K.) ―

And لَا يُبَاعُ غَائِبٌ بِنَاجِزٍ, meaning, A debt to be

like يَدٌ بِيَدٍ, and عَاجِلٌ بِعَاجِلٍ. (TA.) It is
said in a trad., بِيعُوا حَاضِرًا بِنَاجِزٍ [Sell ye present
merchandise for ready money]. (S.) And a
poet ('Abeed Ibn-El-Abras, TA, art. كلأ,) says,
وَإِذَا تُبَاشِرُكَ الهُمُو
مُ فَإِنَّهَا كَالٍ وَنَاجِزْ
(S, TA, ubi supra;) [And when griefs attend
thee, know that] they are, some, debts to be
payed at future periods, and some, payments
in ready money. (TA, ubi supra.) The saying
[of 'Abd-Allah Ibn-'Ámir El-Kurashee, owner
of a horse named Esh-Shamoos, (TA, art.
شمس,)]
جَرْىَ الشَّمُوسِ نَاجِزًا بِنَاجِزِ
[app. meaning, Quickly as the running of EshShamoos; ready with ready, or prompt with
prompt;] is explained by IAar, as meaning,
Thou hast given an evil recompense and I have
recompensed thee in like manner: or, as he says
in one place, this is said when one does a thing
and thou dost the like thereof; he not being able
to go beyond thee in word or in deed. (TA.)
[Respecting this saying, Freytag says, in his
Arab. Prov., i. 305, (where, for نَاجِزًا we find
نَاجِزٌ,) that it applies to him who is equal to
the execution of the things which he undertakes,
as well good as bad: and that جَرَى is to be
supplied before جَرْىَ.]
