upon it with its extremity]: also, a question
educed by reflection, [بِالتَّفَكُّرِ, as the passage here
translated is given in the Kull, p. 362, but in
the TA بالنقل, which is an evident mistake, as
might be shown by many authorities,] which
makes an impression upon the heart, on hearing
or considering which one generally makes marks
upon the ground with the finger or the like:
(El-Fenáree's Expos. of the Telweeh:) a nice,
