تنمّر [He made himself like a leopard or
panther, in diversity of colours: see also 1].
'Amr Ibn-Maadee-Kerib says,
قَوْمٌ إِذَا لَبِسُوا الحَدِي
دَ تَنَمَّرُوا حَلَقًا وَقِدَّا
[A people who, when they put on armour of iron
mail,] make themselves like the leopard or panther
(نَمِر) in the diversity of colours of the iron [rings]
and the thongs. (S.) ―
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  He made himself like
the leopard or panther (نَمِر, K, TA) in ill-nature:
(TA:) (tropical:)  he became angry; as also ↓ نَمِرَ, (M,)
aor.
نَمَرَ, inf. n. ↓ نَمَرٌ; (TA;) and ↓ نمّر: (M:) (tropical:)  he
became evil in disposition; as also ↓ نَمِرَ: (T:)
(tropical:)  he became angry and evil in disposition; as also
↓ نَمِرَ and ↓ نمّر; (IKtt, Sgh, K;) like the نَمِر:
(TA:) (tropical:)  he strained the voice in threatening:
(Sgh, K:) and تنمّر لَهُ (assumed tropical:)  he became ill-natured
and altered to him, and threatened him; because
the نَمِر is never met otherwise than angry and illnatured. (As, S, K.)
نِمْرٌ: see نَمِرٌ.
نَمِرٌ: see أَنْمَرُ, throughout. ―
-b2-  نَمِرٌ (S, A, Msb,
K, &c.) and نِمْرٌ, (M, A, Msb, K,) which is a
contraction of the former, (Msb,) or a dial. form,
(TA,) [The leopard;] a certain wild beast, (S,
A, Msb, K, &c.) well known, (A, K,) more malignant than the lion, (T, M, Mgh, Msb,) and
bolder, (Msb,) so called because of his نُمَر [or
spots], (M, K,) being of divers colours, (M,)
called in Persian پَلَنْكْ: (Mgh:) fem. with ة:
(S, Msb:) pl. [of pauc.] أَنْمُرٌ (M, K) and أَنْمَارٌ,
(M, Msb, K,) and [of mult.] نُمُورٌ, (S, M, Msb,
K,) held by Th to be pl. of نِمْرٌ, (M,) and نُمُورَةٌ
(Msb, and so in some copies of the K) and نُمُرٌ,
(S, M, K,) which occurs in poetry, and is anomalous, perhaps a contraction of نُمُورٌ, (S,) and not
mentioned by Sb, (M,) and نُمْرٌ, (M, K,) which
is the most common in occurrence, but, accord.
to Th, he who uses it makes the sing. أَنْمَرُ, (M,)
and نِمَارٌ, (M, K,) held by Th to be pl. of نِمْرٌ,
(M,) and نِمَارَةٌ. (K.) As the نَمِر is one of the
most abominable and malignant of wild beasts,
one says, لَبِسَ فُلَانٌ لِفُلَانٍ جِلْدَ النَّمِرِ, meaning,
(tropical:)  Such a one became changed, or altered, to such
a one; or met him in a morose manner: (IB:)
or became very rancourous, or malicious, towards
him. (TA.) The kings of the Arabs, when they
sat [in judgment] to slay a man, used to attire
themselves in skins of the نَمِر, and then give
orders for the slaying of him whom they desired
to slay. (IB.)

Mgh, Msb,) having white and black stripes, or

the desert: (A, Msb:) and a garment of the kind
called حِبَرَة; (M, K;) so called because of the
diversity of the colours of its stripes: (M:) or
any مئْزَر, of those worn by the Arabs of the desert,
that is a striped شَمْلَة: (IAth:) or a striped إِزَار
of wool; (TA;) pl. نِمَارٌ: (IAth, Msb:) it is an
epithet in which the quality of a subst. predominates. (TA.) It is said in a trad. of Saad,
نَبَطِىٌّ فِى حُبْوَتِهِ أَعْرَابىٌّ فِى نَمِرَتِهِ أَسَدٌ فِى تَأْمُورَتِهِ
[A Nabathean in his hubweh (a long piece of

(زَاكٍ فِى المَاشِيَة نَامٍ, T, M,) whether sweet or not
sweet. (M.) [As زَاكٍ is coupled with نَامٍ, app.
as an explicative adjunct, in the T and M, I
think that I have here rendered it correctly:
otherwise I should have supposed it to mean,
perhaps, pure.] ―
-b2-  حَسَبٌ نَمِيرٌ, (S, M, A, K,)
and ↓ نَمِرٌ, (M, K,) (tropical:)  i. q. زَاكٍ [see above]: (S, M,

a collection of clouds having marks like those of
the نَمِر: or small portions near together: n. un.
with ة: (M:) or ↓ نَمِرَةٌ signifies a small portion
of a cloud: and its pl. [or rather the coll. gen. n.]
is نَمِرٌ. (K.) It is said in a proverb, أَرِنِيهَا نَمِرَةً
أُرِكَهَا مَطِرَةً [Show thou it to me spotted like the
leopard, I will show it to thee raining]: (S, K:)
alluding to an event which one certainly knows
will happen when the symptoms thereof appear:
(Meyd, K, TA:) originally said by Aboo-Dhueyb El-Hudhalee: (TA:) نَمِرَة is here like خَضِرًا
in the Kur, vi. 99, for أَخْضَرَ: (Akh, S:) by rule,
it should be نَمْرَآءَ, (K, TA,) fem. of أَنْمَرُ. (TA.)

signifies striped, (see نَمِرَةٌ,) or, as in the latter
case, spotted.]
