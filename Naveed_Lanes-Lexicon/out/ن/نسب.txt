[as عَلَوِىٌّ, فَاطِمِىٌّ, قُرَشِىٌّ, مَكِّىٌّ, جَوْهَرِىٌّ:] ending
with ىّ. A more general name of this kind
should precede a more particular one: thus you
say القُرَشِىُّ الهَاشِمِىُّ: and it is better that a
name of relation to a tribe should precede one
of relation to a town or the like: thus you say
القُرَشِىُّ المَكِّىُّ. It is said that the Arabs originally called themselves by such names only
in relation to tribes; and that, when they took
up their abodes in cultivated lands and in cities,
they borrowed names of relation to towns and
the like from the Persians and Copts. (Msb.)
