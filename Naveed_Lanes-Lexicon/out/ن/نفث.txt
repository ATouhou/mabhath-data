نفث1
نَفَثَ, aor.
نَفِثَ and
نَفُثَ, inf. n. نَفْثٌ (S, K) and
نَفَثَانٌ, (TA,) [He puffed; or blew, without
spitting: or he sputtered, or blew forth a little
spittle in minute scattered particles: or] he spat:
or he [did as though he] spat without ejecting
spittle: and نَفَثَ فى العُقْدَةِ signifies he spat,
ejecting a little spittle, upon the knot, in enchantment: (Msb:) or النَّفْثُ is like النَّفْخُ, or blowing,
and less than التَّفْلُ, or spitting, or ejecting spittle
from the mouth: (S, K:) or like blowing, with
[the emission of] spittle: (Keshsháf;) or like
blowing, as done in enchantment, without spittle:
the action, if accompanied by spittle, being
termed التفل: this is the most correct explanation: ('Ináyeh:) or gentle blowing without
spittle: (الاذكار:) or more than blowing; or
like blowing; but less than spitting: sometimes
without spittle, thus differing from التفل; and
sometimes with a little spittle, thus differing from
النفخ: or the emitting wind from the mouth,
together with a little spittle. (MF.) ―
