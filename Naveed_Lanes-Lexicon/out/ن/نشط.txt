called عِقَال]: (S, * Mgh, TA:) a proverb, relating
to an event's happening quickly; (Mgh;) or
said of him who commences any work quickly;

above, in this paragraph; and see 1, where a
similar meaning is assigned to the unaugmented
verb.]

الشُّفْعَةُ كَنَشْطَةِ العِقَالِ The right termed شفعة is
like the loosing of the bond called عقال, in respect
of the speediness with which it becomes of no
effect, (Mgh, Msb,) by delay, (Msb,) is of the
measure فَعْلَةٌ from أَنْشَطَ, or from نَشَطَ in the
sense of انشط; or the meaning is, like the tying
of the عقال; i. e., it is of short duration; but the
former explanation is the more apparently right.
(Mgh.)
بِئْرٌ نَشُوطٌ A well from which the bucket does not
come forth until it is much pulled, (As, S, TA,)
by reason of the distance of its bottom; (TA;)
contr. of بِئْرٌ أَنْشَاطٌ. (K.)

the souls like as the bucket is drawn forth from
the well: (Zj, TA:) or the angels that loose the
soul of the believer gently: (Fr, * Ibn-'Arafeh, K:)
or the believing souls that are brisk, lively, sprightly,
or active, at death: (K, * TA:) or, as some say,
[too fancifully,] the angels that ratify events;

and, accord. to the TA, on the authority of As,
and mentioned by IB on the authority of
A'Obeyd,) A well of little depth, from which the
bucket comes forth by means of a single pull: (As,
S, K:) the latter may be defended on the ground
of considering إِنْشَاطٌ as originally an inf. n., of
أَنْشَطَ signifying “ he loosed, untied, or undid,” a
knot “ by a single pull. ” (TA.)
أُنْشُوطَةٌ [A knot tied with a bow, or with a
