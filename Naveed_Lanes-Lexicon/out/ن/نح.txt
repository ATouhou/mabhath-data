نَحِ3َ, inf. n. نَحِيحٌ, He (a man) reiterated a sound, or made it to reciprocate, (رَدَّدَهُ,)
in his inside: (S, L:) or his voice was reiterated,
or made to reciprocate, (تَرَدَّدَ,) in his inside; as
also ↓ نَحْنَحَ and ↓ تَنَحْنَحَ: (K:) [each of these
verbs, of which the last seems to be the most
common, signifies, as is implied in the L &c., and
accord. to present usage, he made a reiterated
humming in his throat, like a slight coughing, or,
as some say, more violent than coughing; as is
often done by a niggard when he is asked for a
thing:] التَّنَحْنُحُ is well known, (S,) and النَّحْنَحَةُ
is like it; (Lth, S;) it is [the making a sound,
or sounds, in the throat,] slighter than coughing;
and is the pretence of the niggard: (Lth:) or it
is more violent than coughing; as also النَّحِيحُ.

شَحِيحٌ نَحِيحٌ [Very niggardly, or avaricious]:
the latter word is an imitative sequent: (S, K:)
or it is a corroborative syn. of the former: (MF:)
as though meaning one who when asked for
something, disliking to give it, has recourse to a
pretence, and makes a reiterated breathing [or
humming in his throat] as a feint to hide his
unwillingness. (L.) [See also نَحَانِحَةٌ.]
