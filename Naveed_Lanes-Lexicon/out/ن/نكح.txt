نكح1
نَكَحَ, (S, K, &c.,) aor.
نَكِحَ, (Msb, K,) and
نَكَحَ, (K,) the latter agreeable with analogy, but
by some rejected, and the former contr. to
analogy, but more common, and the form used
in the Kur, (TA,) the only instance of an aor.
of this form from a verb having ح for its last
radical letter, except ينطح and يمنح and ينضح
and ينبح and يرجح and يأنح and يأزح and
يملح, (ISd,) [and يضح] inf. n. نِكَاحٌ (S, K, &c.)
and نَكْحٌ; (ISd, K;) Inivit feminam: and
(sometimes, S) he married, took in marriage, or
contracted a marriage with, a woman: as also
↓ استنكح (S, K, &c.) [and ↓ ناكح, inf. n.
مُنَاكَحَةٌ:] used only with reference to a man:
(ISd:) but Th uses it with reference to flies:
(TA:) J says, that it is sometimes used in the
latter sense; but accord. to the Msb it is more
commonly so used; (MF;) and it is used only
in this sense in the Kur: (TA:) IF and others
say, that it signifies coitus; and coitus without
marriage; and marriage without coitus: (Msb:)
[but] in the Time of Ignorance, when a man
demanded a woman in marriage he said,
اِنْكِحِينِى; and when he desired fornication, he
said, سَافِحِينِى. (TA, in art سفح.) It is disputed whether it be proper or tropical in these
two senses; or proper in one, and tropical in
one: (MF:) it is said to be from نَكَحَهُ الدَّوَى,
or from تَنَاكَحَتِ الأَشْجَارُ, or from نَكَحَ المَطَرُ
الأَرْضَ; and if so, it is tropical in both the above
senses; and the opinion that it is so is confirmed
by this, that the signification of marriage is not
understood unless by a word or phrase in connexion with it, as when you say نَكَحَ فِى بَنِى
فُلَانٍ [he took a wife from among the sons of
such a one]; nor is that of coitus unless by the
same means, as when you say نَكَحَ زَوْجَتَهُ [inivit conjugem suam]; and this is one of the signs
of a tropical expression. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  نَكَحَتْ She
married, or took a husband. (S, K.) ―
-b3-  نَكَحَ
المَطَرُ الأَرْضَ The rain became commingled with
the soil: (Msb:) or, rested upon the ground so as to
soak it; syn. إِعْتَمَدَ عَلَيْهَا: (K:) as also ↓ نَاكَهَا.
(L.) ―
-b4-  نَكَحَهُ الدَّوَى The disease infected him
(خَامَرهُ), and overcame him. (Msb.) ―
-b5-  نَكَحَ
النُّعَاسُ عَيْنَهُ (tropical:)  Drowsiness overcame his eye;
(K;) as also نَاكَهَا: and in like manner ↓ استنكح
النَّوْمُ عَيْنَهُ sleep overcame his eye. (TA.)

-b2-  تَنَاكَحَتِ

إِسْتَنْكَحَ see 1.
نِكْحٌ and ↓ نُكْحٌ substs. from أَنْكَحَهَا, [The act
of giving a woman in marriage]. (K.) ―
-b2-  [These
two words are properly quasi-inf. ns, of أَنْكَحَ,
signifying as explained above; and, like inf. ns.,
may be used as epithets, meaning A giver of a
woman in marriage, correlative to خُِطْبٌ.] It
was a custom, in the time of paganism, for a
man to come to a tribe asking for a woman in
marriage; and he would stand up in their assembly, and say خِطْبٌ, i. e., I have come as an asker
of a woman in marriage; whereupon it would
be said to him نِكْحٌ, meaning We marry her to
thee, or give her to thee in marriage, [or, more
lit., we are givers of her in marriage: for an inf.
n. or quasi-inf. n. used as an epithet is used
without variation as sing., dual., and pl.; and
masc. and fem.]. ↓ نُكْحٌ was also said: but نِكْحٌ
is here said for the sake of resemblance to خِطْبٌ.
(L.) You say هو نِكْحُهَا He is the person who
gives her in marriage: and هِىَ نِكْحَتُهُ She is the
person whom he gives in marriage. (Lh, L) ―
-b3-
نِكْحٌ and ↓ نُكْحٌ, [and, accord. to Lth and ISh,
نِكِحٌ: see إِبِدٌ:] are also two words by which the
[Pagan] Arabs used to take women in marriage:
(S:) [meaning A giver of a woman in marriage].
(MF, in art. خطب.) A man used to say to
Umm-Khárijeh, in asking her in marriage, خُِطْبٌ,
and she used to reply نُكِْحٌ: hence the saying
أَسْرَعُ مِنْ نِكَاحِ أُمِّ خَارِجَةَ [Quicker than the marriage of Umm-Khárijeh]. (S, K.) [See خِطْبٌ].
نُكْحٌ: see نِكْحٌ.
نُكَحٌ: see نَكَحُةٌ.
رَجُلٌ نُكَحَةٌ, (S, K,) and ↓ نُكَحٌ (K) A man
who marries much, or often: (S, K, TA:) AZ
explains the former by شَدِيدُ النِّكَاحِ, [app. meaning
vehement in coitus,] and mentions as its pl. نُكَحَاتٌ:
(TA:) [and ↓ نَكَّاحٌ (A, TA, art. تيس, &c.) signifies the same.]
نَكَّاحٌ: see نُكَحَةٌ.
نَاكِحٌ (S, K) and نَاكِحَةٌ, (K,) the latter occurring in poetry, (TA,) A woman married;
(TA;) having a husband. (S, K, TA.) Ex.
هِىَ نَاكِحٌ فِى بَنِى فُلاَنٍ She has a husband among
the sons of such a one. (S.)
مَنْكَِحٌ and مَنْكُوحَةٌ: see مَنَاكِحُ.
مَنَاكِحُ Women, or wives; syn. نِسَآءٌ: (K:) a
pl. having no sing.; or its sing. is ↓ مَنْكَحٌ; [or
↓ مَنْكِحٌ, which occurs in the S and K, art.
علث, evidently as signifying a wife; as though
being a place of نِكَاح;] or ↓ مَنْكُوحَةٌ. (TA.)
―
-b2-  إِنَّ المَنَاكِحَ خَيْرَهُا الأَبْكَارُ [Verily the best of
women to take in marriage are virgins]. A proverb. (TA.)
