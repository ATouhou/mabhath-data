ندب1
نَدَبَهُ لِلْأَمْرِ, (S,) or إِلَى الأَمْرِ, aor.
نَدُبَ, (Msb,
K,) inf. n. نَدْبٌ; (Msb, TA;) and ↓ انتدبه
للامر; this latter verb being used transitively
as well as intransitively; (Msb;) He, or
it, called, summoned, or invited, him to the
thing; (S, Msb, K;) and instigated, incited, or
urged, him to it: (K.) i. e., to war, succour,
&c. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [You say,] مَا نَدَبَنِى إِلَى مَا
فَعَلْتُ إِلَّا النُّصْحُ لَكَ (tropical:)  Nothing incited me to do
what I have done but sincerity towards thee. (TA.)
―
-b3-  نَدَبَهُ إِلَى أَمْرٍ, [and لِأَمْرٍ; and ↓ ندّبهُ; (see
مَنْدُوبٌ;)] He sent him to do a thing. (K.) ―
-b4-
نَدَبَ المَيِّتَ, (aor.
نَدُبَ, inf. n. نَدْبٌ, S,) (tropical:)  He
wailed for, wept for, or deplored the loss of, the
dead man, and enumerated his good qualities and
actions. (S, K.) نَدَبُتِ الميّب (tropical:)  She (a wailing
woman) called upon the dead man, praising him,
and saying وَافُلَانَاهُ and وَاهَنَاهُ, Alas for such a
one! and Alas for thee! (M) or she, as it were,
called upon the dead man, enumerating his good
qualities and actions, as though he heard her.
(Msb.) It is said that the action is peculiarly
that of women; and that the verb is derived
from نَدَبَهُ, “he called him ” to do a thing; or
from نَدَبٌ, “a scar,” because the wailer mentions
the memorials of him who has gone; or perhaps
from نَدْبٌ, “lightness, or activity. ” (MF.)
-A2-
نَدِبَ, aor.
نَدَبَ, (inf. n. نَدَبٌ, TA;) and ↓ اندب; It
(a wound) had a hardened scar, such as is termed
نَدَبَة. (K.) ―
-b2-  نَدِبَ, aor.
نَدَبَ, inf. n. نَدَبٌ [so
accord. to the TA, agreeably with analogy; but
in the CK and a MS. copy, نَدْبٌ; whence, and
from the form of the latter of the two inf. ns.
here following, it seems not improbable that the
verb may be also written نَدَبَ;] and نُدُوبَةٌ and
نُدُوبٌ, It (the back) had upon it scars, such as
are termed نُدُوب. (K.)
-A3-  نَدُبَ, aor.
نَدُبَ, inf. n.

(occurring in a trad., TA,) God answereth his
prayer for forgiveness [who goeth forth to fight
for the sake of his religion]: or is surety, or
guarantee, for him: or hasteneth to grant him
a good recompense: or graciously maketh his
completion of that [recompense] to him necessary
and sure. (K.) ―
-b3-  انتدبوا إِلَيْهِ They hastened
to him, either at his call, or summons, or

-b4-  خُذْ مَا انتدب

children to a bad nurse; for it [that is the evil
consequence, or the bad qualities that will be
acquired,] will inevitably appear some day. Said
by 'Omar. (TA.)
نَدْبٌ A man who is light, or active, (and
quick, TA,) in the accomplishment of an affair,
or a want; (S, K;) as also ↓ مِنْدَبَى (K) and
↓ مِنْدِبَى: (TA:) a man who, when he is sent to
accomplish a great, or an important, affair, finds
it light to him: (A:) clever, ingenious, or acute
in mind; excellent: pl. نُدُوبٌ and نُدَبَاءُ: (K:)
the former agreeable with analogy; the latter
formed from the imaginary sing. نَدِيبٌ; like
سُمَحَاءُ, pl. of سَمْحٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  نَدْبٌ, as applied
to a horse, Sharp-spirited; (Lth, S;) contr. of
بَلِيدٌ (Lth) excellent. (TA.) ―

or activity. (MF.) ―
-b4-  أَرَاكَ نَدْبًا فِى الحَوَائِجِ

-A2-  See نَدَبٌ.
نَدَبٌ, (S, K,) and, by poetical licence, ↓ نَدْبٌ,
(MF,) The scar, (S,) or scars, (K,) of a wound,
(S, K,) not rising above the surrounding skin:
(S:) accord. to the K, pl. نَدَبَةٌ [which is written
in several MS. copies of the K نَدْبَةٌ; and so in
the CK; but this, accord. to the TA, is incorrect;] but it is a coll. gen. n., of which the
n. un. is نَدَبَةٌ, like as شَجَرَةٌ is that of شَجَرٌ:
(MF:) pl. أَنْدَابٌ and نُدُوبٌ: (K:) the former
of نَدَبٌ agreeably with analogy: the latter dev.
with respect to analogy; or pl. of نَدْبٌ. (MF.)
―
-b2-  نَدَبٌ is also applied, in a trad., to the
(tropical:)  Marks made by Moses' smiting the stone [from
which, thereupon, water flowed forth]; these
marks being thus likened to the scars of wounds.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  نَدَبٌ is also employed to signify
(tropical:)  Scars upon men's reputation. A poet says,
قَوْمٌ سَأَتْرُكُ فِى أَعْرَاضِهِمْ نَدَبَا
A people upon whose reputation I will leave scars,
the effects of my satires. (TA.)
-A2-  نَدَبٌ The
direction in which one shoots an arrow or
arrows: syn. رِشْقٌ. (So in the S and the CK
and several MS. copies of the K: in other copies,
رَشْقٌ The act of shooting an arrow or arrows.
Both these readings are correct accord. to the
TA. See below.) إِرْتَمَى نَدَبًا أَوْ نَدَبَيْنِ He
shot an arrow or arrows in one direction or in
two directions: syn. وَجْهًا أَوْ وَجْهَيْنِ. (TA.) ―
-b2-
نَدَبُنَا يَوْمَ كَذَا (said by those who are to contend
at a shooting-match, TA,) The day of our commencing shooting shall be such a day. (K.) This
confirms the assertion in the TA, that نَدَبٌ is
syn. with رَشْقٌ, as well as with رِشْقٌ. In the
Turk. K, in the place of يَوْمَ ابْتِدَائِنَا, we find
يوم انْتِدَابِنَا; and Freytag adopts the latter
reading; but I find no other authority for it.]
―
-b3-  نَدَبٌ A bet, wager, stake, or thing wagered;
what is staked at a shooting match, or a race,
and taken by the winner: (S, * K, * L:) pl. أَنْدَابٌ.
(Msb.) So in the following phrases. ―
-b4-  بَيْنَهُمْ
نَدَبٌ [Between them is a bet, or wager]. ―
-b5-  أَقَامَ
فُلَانٌ عَلَى نَدَبٍ [Such a one stood to a bet,
wager, or stake]. (TA.) ―
-b6-  'Orweh says,
أَيَهْلِكُ مُعْتَمٌّ وَزَيْدٌ وَلَمْ أُقِمْ
عَلَى نَذَبٍ يَوْمًا وَلِى نَفْسُ مُخْطِرِ
[Shall Moatemm and Zeyd perish, and I not
stand to a stake, some day, when I have the soul
of one who makes his life a stake to his adversary
and sallies forth against him?] These two were
his ancestors. (S.) Or, accord. to Az, who reads
أَتَهْلِكُ, they were two tribes. (TA.)
نَدِبٌ: see نَدِيبٌ.
نَدْبَةٌ [a fem. epithet] Any camel's foot, or hoof,
[meaning any camel, or hoofed beast,] that does
not remain in one state. (K.)
نُدْبَةٌ, a subst., A call; a summons; an invitation to do a thing. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  نُدْبَةٌ: a subst.,
(tropical:)  The act of wailing for, weeping for, lamenting,
or deploring the loss of, one who is dead, as
described in the explanations of نَدَبَ الميّت, and
بَدَبَتْه. (S, K, M, Msb.) ―
-b3-  [هَآءُ النَّدْبَةِ The ه
of lamentation].
-A2-  عَرَبِىٌّ نُدْبَةٌ An Arabian of
chaste speech; (K;) eloquent. (TA.)
نَدِيبٌ, (K,) or ↓ نَدِبٌ, (L,) A back having
upon it scars, such as are termed نُدُوب: (L, K:)
the former epithet is also applied in the same
sense to a wound: and, so applied, is also explained by the word مَنْدُوبٌ: (TA:) [app. meaning that will be wailed for, or deplored; i. e.,
fatal].
نَادِبَةٌ (tropical:)  A wailing woman; or one wailing for,
weeping for, or deploring the loss of, one who is
dead, as described in the explanations of نَدَبَ
الميّت, and نَدَبَتْهُ: (M, Msb:) pl. نَوَادِبُ. (Msb.)
النَّدَّابَتَانِ a name given to Two bad marks in
horses. (TA.)
مَنْدَبٌ A place to which one is called, summoned, or invited. Hence بَابُ المَنْدَبِ [The
Strait Báb el-Mendeb, or The Strait of the Place
of Summons:] so called because a certain king
summoned a number of men to break through
the mountain there, which originally opposed a
barrier to the sea, in order to drown his enemy;
and this they did, thus overwhelming with the
waters many cities and towns with their inhabitants, and forming the sea which intervenes
between El-Yemen and Abyssinia, and which
extends to 'Eydháb and Kuseyr [&c.]. (Yaakoot.)
This king was Alexander the Greek! (TA.) [It
is probable that the appearance of the Strait gave
rise to this story, and thus to its name: but it is
also probable that the name may signify The
Strait of the Place of Wailing for the Dead; as
many perish who go forth from it.]
مَنْدَبَى and مِنْدِبَى: see نَدْبٌ.
مُنَدَّبٌ: see مَنْدُوبٌ.
مَنْدُوبٌ One sent to do a thing; a messenger; an envoy; an ambassador. (TA.) ―
-b2-
فُلَانٌ مَنْدُوبٌ لِأَمْرٍ عَظِيمٍ, and لَهُ ↓ مُنَدَّبٌ, Such
a one is sent to do a great thing; or to perform an
important affair. (A.) ―
-b3-  ↓ مُنَدَّبَةٌ an appellation,
given by the people of Mekkeh to their Envoys,
or ambassadors, to the palace of the Khaleefeh.
(TA.) ―
-b4-  مَنْدُوبٌ Desired; sought; sought after;
as the name of a certain horse it is thus explained: from نَدَبٌ, as signifying “ a pledge
that is given on the occasion of a race. ” (L.) ―
-b5-
مَنْدُوبٌ: see نَدَبَ الميّت: A thing bewailed, [or
complained of as painful,] with the exclamation
of يَا or وَا. O! or Alas! (KT.) [The name of
the thing thus bewailed, or complained of, has
always an ا of prolongation and ه annexed to it,
or the ا only.] ―
-b6-  مَنْدُوبٌ, originally مَنْدُوبٌ إِلَيْهِ,
A thing to the performance of which one is called,
summoned, or invited: (Msb:) [hence,] approved:
(K:) a signification verified by the doctors of practical law: (TA:) a thing the doing of which is more
excellent than the leaving it undone, in the eye of
the prescriber of the law, but which it is allowable
to leave undone. (KT.) [Freytag, in quoting
the original words, omits فِعْلُهُ before راجحًا.]
