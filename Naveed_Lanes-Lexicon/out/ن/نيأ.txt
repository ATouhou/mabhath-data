نيأ1
نَآءَ, aor. يَنِىْءُ, (so in the S, Nh, L, Msb;
but in some copies of the K, يناءُ, [which appears
to be put by mistake for the inf. n. in the acc.
case];) inf. n. نَىْءٌ, (S,) and نَىٌّ, without ء,
and نَوْءٌ, (Sh,) It (flesh meat, &c.) was not, or
did not become, sufficiently cooked; it was insufficiently cooked: (S, K:) (like نَهِئَ:) or it
was untouched by fire; (i. e., raw]. (L.) ―
-b2-
It (a thing) was not firmly, not soundly, not
thoroughly, done. [See 4.] (TA.)

نَيَّاَ see 4.

اناء الأَمْرَ He did the thing not firmly, not
soundly, not thoroughly. الامر ↓ نيّأ, accord. to
the K, signifies the same: but this is unknown,
and not authorized by transmission [from the
Arabs of the classical ages], and therefore not
mentioned by IM nor by other leading lexicographers: the correct phrases are [when the
verb is intrans.] ناء الامرُ [and اللحمُ], and [when
it is trans.] اناء اللحمَ [and الامر]: the forms
of the verb being like بَانَ and أَبَانَ. (TA.) ―
-b2-
اناء, (S, incorrectly written in the K أَنْيَأَ, TA,)
inf. n. إِنَآءَةٌ, He insufficiently cooked flesh-meat
[&c.]. (S, K.)
نِىْءٌ Flesh meat &c. insufficiently cooked: (S,
K:) or untouched by fire; [i. e., raw]. (L.)
It was also pronounced by the Arabs نِىٌّ; but
the original word is with ء. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Wine
untouched by the fire: cooked [or mulled] wine
being called نَضِيجٌ, (TA [written نِىٌّ, without ء]).
―
-b3-  Pure [and sweet] milk: sour milk being
called نضيج: or milk just drawn from the udder,
before it is put into the skin. (TA [written نِىٌّ,
without ء.])
نَىٌّ [for نَىْءٌ] Fat, as contradistinguished from
flesh, [which is app. called نَضِيجٌ]. (TA.)
نُيُوْءٌ and نُيُوْءَةٌ The state of being insufficiently
cooked: (S, K:) or of being untouched by fire;
[i. e., rawness]. (L.)
