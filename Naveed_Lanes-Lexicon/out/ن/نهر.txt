Kur, [xciii. 10,] وَأَمَّا السَّائِلَ فَلَا تَنْهَرْ [And as for
the beggar, thou shalt not chide him, or address
him with rough speech]. And in a trad., مَنِ انْتَهَرَ

نَهْرٌ and ↓ نَهَرٌ (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K) A channel
in which water runs: (A, K:) so most say: or
the water itself [that runs therein; i. e., a river;
a rivulet; a brook; a canal of running water]:
(TA:) or a wide channel in which water runs:
originally, the water [that runs therein]: (Mgh:)
or properly, wide running water: and by a secondary application, which is tropical. (tropical:)  the trench
or channel [in which it runs]: (Msb, TA *:) pl.
[of pauc.] أَنْهُرٌ, (Msb, K,) a pl. of the former,
(Msb,) and أَنْهَارٌ, (S, Msb, K,) a pl. of the latter,
(Msb,) [but used as a pl. of either, both of pauc.
and of mult. and the most common of all the
pls.,] and نُهُرٌ, (Msb, and so in some copies of the
K,) with two dammehs, a pl. of the former,
(Msb,) or نُهْرٌ, (as in some copies of the K and in
the TA,) and نُهُورٌ, (IAar, K.) You say, جَرَى
النَّهْرُ [The river ran, or flowed]; like as you say,
جَرَى المِيزَابُ. (Msb.) And نَهْرٌ كَثِير المَآءِ [A
channel of running water having much water].
(A.) And ↓ نَهَرٌ is also used in a pl. sense: as in
the Kur, [liv. 54], فِى جَنَّاتٍ وَنَهَرٍ [In gardens
and among rivers], i. e., أَنْهَارِ; like the phrase in
the Kur, (same chap. verse 45,] وَيُوَلُّونَ الدُّبْرَ,
(Fr, S.) meaning الأَدْبَارَ, (Fr, TA:) but it is
otherwise explained. (S.) See نَهَرٌ below.
نَهَرٌ: see نَهْرٌ, in two places.
-A2-  Amplitude:
(K:) or light and amplitude: so, accord. to
some, in the Kur, liv. 54, differently explained
above: see نَهْرٌ, (S, TA.) or, accord. to Th, نَهَر
is a pl. [or rather quasi pl.] of نُهُرٌ, which is a pl.
of نهَارٌ. (TA.)
نَهِرٌ Much, (TA;) as also ↓ نَهيرٌ; (K, TA;)
both applied to water. (TA.) ―
-b2-  A wide نَهْر [or
river, or channel in which water runs]. (K.)
-A2-
رَخُلٌ نَهِرٌ A man of day-time; syn. صَاحِبُ نَهَارٍ;
(S, K;) who makes inroads or incursions into the
territories of enemies therein: (S:) or who works
therein: (A:) a kind of rel. n.; as is shown by
the ex.
لَسْتُ بِلَيْلِىٍّ وَلٰكِنِّى نهِرٌ
لَا أُدْلِجُ اللَّيْلَ وَلٰكِنْ أَبْتَكِرْ
[I am not one of the night-time, but I am one of
the day-time; I do not journey in the night, but
I go forth early in the morning]: as though he
said ↓ نَهَارِىّ. (Sb.) The verse is correctly related as above; not as it is given in the S. (IB.)
―
-b2-  See also أَنْهَرُ.
نَهَارٌ Day; or day-time; contr. of لَيْلٌ: (S,
TA:) or broad daylight, (Mgh,) from sunrise to
sunset: (Mgh, Msb, K:) this is the original signification: (TA;) or this is the signification in
the vulgar conventional language: but in the
classical language it signifies the time from the
rising of the dawn to sunset: (Msb:) or the light
between the rising of the dawn and sunset: (K:)
and so accord. to the lawyers: (TA:) in the
trads., it is the whiteness of the نهار, and the
blackness of the ليل; and there is nothing intervening between the ليل and the نهار: but sometimes the Arabs amplified, and applied نهار to the
time from the clear shining of the dawn to the
setting [of the sun]: (Msb.) or (so accord. to the
TA. but in some copies of the K, and the
spreading of the light [which is a cause] of sight
and its dispersion: (K:) in this explanation in
the L, in the place of وَافْتِرَاقُهُ we find وَاجْتِمَاعُهُ
[and its collecting together]: (TA:) it is also syn.
with يَوْمٌ; and is so when used without restriction
in the non-fundamental sciences of religion,
(الفُرُوع,) as in the phrases صُمْ نَهَارًا [fast thou a
day] and إِعْمَلْ نَهَارًا [work thou a day]: and it
may be so used, or in its proper classical sense,
when prefixed to يَوْم, governing the latter in the
gen. case: (Msb:) it has no proper dual, (Mgh,
Msb,) and no proper pl., (S, Mgh, Msb, K, (like
عَذَابٌ and سَرَابٌ; (S, K;) the former of which,
however, has a pl. assigned to it [by Zj and] in
the K, namely, أَعْذِبَةٌ; (MF;) [and respecting
the latter see شَرَابٌ, with ش;] [for] نهار is a name
applied to every يَوْم [or day]; and لَيْلٌ, to every
لَيْلَة [or night]: one does not say نَهَارٌ وَنَهَارَانِ, nor
لَيْلٌ وَلَيْلَانِ: but the sing. of نهار is يَوْمٌ (TA.)
and the dual, يَوْمَانِ, (Msb, TA:) and the pl.,
أَيَّامٌ. (Msb:) and the contr. of يوْمٌ is لَيْلَةٌ, so
says Az, on the authority of AH(??) (TA:) or
it has pls.: namely, أَنْهُرٌ, (IAar, S, K,) a pl. of
pauc., (S,) in some lexicons أَنْهِرَةٌ, (TA,) also a
pl. of pauc.,] and نُهُرٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) a pl. of
mult. (S) [See also نَهَرٌ.] Ibn-Keys(??) cites
the following ex.,
لَوْلَا الثَّرِيدَان لَمُتْنَا بِالضُّمُرْ
ثَرِيدُ لَيْلٍ وَثرِيدٌ بِالنَّهُرْ
[Were it not for the two thereeds (or messes of
crumbled bread moistened with broth), we had died
of leanness: the thereed of night, and thereed in
the day-times]. (S.)
نَهِيرٌ: see نَهِرٌ.
نَهَارِىٌّ: see نَهِرٌ. ―
-b2-  Food that is eaten in the
beginning of the day. (TA.)
نَهَارٌ أَنْهَرُ, and ↓ نَهرٌ, [A bright day:] in each of
these phrases the epithet has an intensive effect,
(K, * TA,) as the epithet in لَيْلٌ أَلْيَلُ. (TA.)
مَنْهَرٌ The place of a river. (T, TA.) ―
-b2-  A
place which the water hollows out in a نَهْر [or
channel of a river]. (K.) ―
-b3-  A cleft, (K, TA,)
or hole, (TA,) in a fortress, passing through [the
wall], whence water runs. (K, TA,) or by which
water enters: (TA:) pl. مَنَاهِرُ. (TA.)
