(M, K,) inf. n. نَبْرٌ, (S, M,) He pronounced the
letter with hemz (هَمْز). (S, M, A, K.) قُرَيْشٌ
لَا تَنْبِرُ [The tribe of Kureysh] do not pronounce
with hemz. (S.) A man said to the Prophet,
يَا نَبِىْءَ اللّٰهِ [O Prophet of God]; and he said
لَا تَنْبِرْ يِاسْمِى, i. e. Pronounce not thou my name
with hemz: (M:) for the tribe of Kureysh did not
pronounce with hemz. (TA.) And when ElMahdee performed the pilgrimage, he preferred
El-Kisáee to recite the prayers in El-Medeeneh,
and the people of that city disapproved of his
pronouncing with hemz, asking him wherefore
he did so in reciting the Kur-án in the mosque
of the Apostle of God. (TA.)

syn. أَكْدَاسٌ, (M, K,) or a collection, (M, S,) of
طَعَام, (S, M, K, MS,) meaning of wheat, and of
barley, [or other corn,] and of dates: (MS:) or
[in the TA, and] granaries (أَهْرَآء) of طَعَام: (in
the present day, a granary:] what is called هُرْىٌ

poured in its place, rises: and the pl. pl. [i. e. pl.
of انبار] is أَنَابِيرُ. (T.) ―

the sing. is نِبْرٌ: but this addition seems to be
misplaced: for انبار in the last of the senses here
explained, as well as when applied to a granary.
and to a collection of طعام, appears to be a pl.
without a sing.]
