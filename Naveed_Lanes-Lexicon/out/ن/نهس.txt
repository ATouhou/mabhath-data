نهس1
نَهَسَهُ, (S, A, Msb, K,) aor.
نَهَسَ (Msb, K,
MS) and
نَهِسَ; (Msb;) and نَهِسَهُ, aor.
نَهَسَ; (Fr, K;)
inf. n. نَهْسٌ (S, Msb, TA) and نُهْسٌ; (TA;)
He (a man, S, Msb) took it (namely flesh or flesh-meat) with his fore teeth, (S, A, Msb, K,) to eat
it, (Msb,) and plucked it off; (A, K;) as also
↓ انتهسهُ: (S:) and he ate it off from a bone
(تَعَرَّقَهُ) with his fore teeth: (Lh, TA:) or he
pulled it off with the central incisors, to eat it:
(TA:) and he took it with the fore part of his
mouth; as also ↓ انتهسهُ: (A:) or he took it
with his mouth: (IAth, TA:) or he took it with
his mouth to bite it and make a mark upon it
without wounding it: (TA, art. نهش:) and he
(a dog, and any animal having a canine tooth,)
bit it: or seized it, and then pulled it, or pulled
it vehemently, or rent it with his teeth: but there
is a difference of opinion respecting this verb in
all its significations: some say that it is with the
unpointed س; and thus, only, it is mentioned
by ISk, who says, I heard El-Kilábee say, of a
dog and of a wolf and of a serpent, ↓ انتهسهُ
and نَهَسَهُ; (Msb;) [and J says, the نَهْس of
the serpent is the same as its نَهْش; (S;) you
say نَهَسَتْهُ الحَيَّةُ in the sense of نَهَشَتْهُ [the
serpent bit him]: (Z, Sgh:) others say that the
verbs are with س and ش throughout; and thus
says IF on the authority of As: Az cites Lth
as saying that نَهْشٌ, with the pointed ش, signifies
taking, or reaching, from a distance, like the
نهش of the serpent; and نَهْسٌ, with the unpointed
letter, the seizing upon flesh, or flesh-meat, and
pulling it, or pulling it vehemently, or rending it
with the teeth: Th says that the latter is with
the extremities of the teeth; and the former, with
the teeth [absolutely], and with [those that are
termed] the أَضْرَاس: IKoot says, like Lth, that
one says of the serpent (الحَيَّة), نَهَشَتْهُ, with the
pointed ش; and of the dog and wolf and hyena,
نَهَسَهُ, with the unpointed letter. (Msb.)
