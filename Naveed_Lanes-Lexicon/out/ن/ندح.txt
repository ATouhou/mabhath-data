-b2-  Hence the saying of Umm-Selemeh
to 'Aïsheh, (when she desired to go forth to
El-Basrah, TA,) قَدْ جَمَعَ القُرْآنُ ذَيْلَكِ فَلَا
تَنْدَحِيهِ, i. e., [The Kur-án hath drawn together,
or contracted, thy skirt; therefore] do not widen
it, (S, L, K,) or do not spread it abroad, (L,)
by thy going forth to El-Basrah: (S, L, K:)
the pronoun ه refers to the word ذيل: the
speaker alluded to the words of the Kur-án,
[xxxiii. 33,] وَقَرْنَ فِى بُيُوُتِكُنَّ وَلَا تَبَرَّجْنَ.

إِنْدَحَّ بَطْنُهُ, inf. n. إِنْدِحَاحٌ, His belly became
distended by reason of repletion. (S.) This, says
IB, is its proper art., not art. دح. (TA, art. دح,
in which J also mentions it.) F says, that J is
in error in mentioning this verb, as also in mentioning إِنْدَاحَ بَطْنُهُ, inf. n. إِنْدِيَاحٌ, in the present
art.; the proper place of the former being in art.
دح; and that of the latter, in art. دوح: but MF
says, that J has merely mentioned them here because of the resemblance of their radical letters
and significations to the radical letters and significations belonging to this art. (TA.)
