trees abounding in Arabia, in the districts of

these has a fruit resembling the almond, which is
sweet from the commencement of its growth; the
other has a fruit in appearance like the Damask
plum (إِجَّاص), is at first sour, and then becomes sweet when ripe: each has a stone, and
has a sweet odour: the fruit of the sour kind is
pressed down in jars, or earthern pots, [حِبَاب:
so I read for جباب:] while fresh, and kept until
it attains to a ripe state, when it becomes as
though it were the banana, in its odour and taste:
the tree grows great so as to become like the
walnut (جَوْز), which it resembles also in its leaves:
and when it attains to perfection, the sweet [fruit]
is yellow; and the bitter, [or sour,] red. (L.)
