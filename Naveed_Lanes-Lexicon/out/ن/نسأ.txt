-b2-  The
Fakeeh of the Arabs [El-Hárith Ibn-Keledeh,
as said in the Mz, close of 39th نوع, where the
following is quoted,] says, مَنْ سَرَّهُ النَّسَآءُ وَلَا
نَسَآءَ فَلْيُخَفِّفِ الرِّدَآءَ وَلْيُبَاكِرِ الغَدَآءَ وَلْيُؤَخِّرِ العَشَآءَ
وَلْيُقِلَّ غِشْيَانَ النِّسَآءِ [Let him whom length of life
rejoiceth (but there is no long endurance in life)
lighten his debts, and make his morning-meal
early, and delay his evening-meal, and take little
enjoyment in women]: (S, * TA:) الرداء here
means debt. (T, M, TA, in art. ردى, where
this saying is cited with some variations.)
نَسِىْءٌ, of the measure فَعِيلٌ in the sense of the
measure مَفْعُولٌ, (S,) A month which the Arabs,
in the time of paganism, postponed: (K:) the
doing of which is forbidden in the Kur, ix. 37.
(S.) ―
-b2-  Also, as an inf. n. of نَسَأَ, (which it is
also said to be in the L,) The postponing of a
month: i. e., the postponing of the sacredness of
a month; transferring it to another month.
When the Arabs returned from Mina, [after the
accomplishment of the pilgrimage,] it was customary for a man of the tribe of Kináneh to arise
and say, أَنَا الَّذِى لَا يُرَدُّ لِى قَضَآءٌ [“ I am he
whose decree is not to be rejected ”]; (S;) or
إِنِّى لَا أُحَابُ وَلَا أُعَابُ وَلَا يُرَدُّ قَوْلِى, or ولا يردّ
مَا قَضَيْتُ بِهِ; [“ Verily I am not to be accused
of a sin, nor am I to be charged with a
fault, nor is my saying, (or decree,) to be rejected; ”] (TA;) whereupon they would say,
أَنْسِئْنَا شَهْرًا [“ Postpone for us a month ”]; i. e.,
“ Postpone for us the sacredness of El-Mo-
harram, and transfer it to Safar: ” for they disliked that three months during which they might
not make predatory expeditions should come upon
them consecutively, as their subsistence was
obtained by such expeditions: so he made ElMoharram free from restriction to them. (S.)
[But this, as appears from what is said in the
Kur, ix. 37, was not done every year.] The
tribes of Teiyi and Khath'am did not observe the
sacred months; therefore the نَاسِئ (or postponer)
proclaimed it lawful to slay them therein, when
they were aggressors. (TA.) ―
-b3-  [The term
نَسِىْء appears also to have been applied to The
postponement of the time of the pilgrimage; which
was another custom of the Pagan Arabs, mentioned under this word in the TA.] The Arabs,
liking that the day of their return from pilgrimage should always be at one season of the
year, postponed it every year eleven days; at
the same time keeping sacred the two months
in which the pilgrimage took place, and the
month next after those two, and also the month
of Rejeb, at whatever season this fell. (TA.)
[For the same purpose, at one time, they used
to intercalate a month in the third and sixth and
eight of every eight years. See Kur, ix. 36,
where the prohibition of this custom is implied; and Sale's Prel. Disc., § vii.]. ―

K,) like كُلْأَةٌ, (S,) A postponement, or delay,
as to the time of the payment of a debt, or of the
price of a thing sold, &c. (S, K, TA.) The first

used as such]. ―
-b6-  ↓ بَاعَهُ بِنَسِيْئَةٍ, and ↓ بِنُسْأَةٍ, (as

a beast is urged or driven with it: (K:) a
pastor's great staff. (TA.) For مِنْسَأَتَهُ, in the
Kur, xxxiv. 13, some read مِنْ سَأَتِهِ; i. e. “ from,
or of, the end of his staff; ” سأَة originally signifying the “ bent part at each end of a bow; ”
(Fr, TA, &c.;) and being here used tropically.
(TA.) This reading is disapproved by the author
of the K. but is supported by good authorities.
(TA.)

(S.) إِنَّ لِى عَنْكَ لَمُنْتَسَأٌ Verily I am far from
