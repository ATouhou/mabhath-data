نَضُبَ (S, K, &c.) and also
نَضِبَ, (Msb,)
which latter is strange, (MF,) inf. n. نُضُوبٌ;
(S, K, &c.;) and ↓ نضّب; (K;) It (water) sank
into the earth; disappeared in the earth: (S,
M, K, &c.:) and became low: (S:) became
remote. (S, M.) ―

a verse cited by Th, [The water of the tank or
cistern, sank into the earth]. (TA.) ―
-b3-  نَضَبَتْ
عُيُونُ الطَّائِفِ [The sources of El-Táïf became

فَمَاتَ فَكُلُوهُ That from which the water of the
sea has become exhausted, and has dried up, it
being alive, and which has then died, eat ye it.
(TA, from a trad.) ―
-b5-  كُنَّا عَلَى شَاطِئِ النَّهْرِ بِالْأَهْوَازِ
وَقَدْ نَضَبَ عَنْهُ المَاءُ [We were on the bank of the
river in El-Ahwáz, and the water had sunk, or
receded, from it, leaving it dry]. (TA, from a
trad.) ―
-b6-  نَضَبَتْ عَيْنُهُ, (aor.
نَضُبَ, inf. n. نُضُوبٌ,
TA,) (tropical:)  His eye sank, or became depressed, in the
socket: or it is only said of the eye of a she-camel. (K.) ―
-b7-  نَضَبَ It (herbage and the like,
that had been abundant,) became little, or scanty:
(K:) or failed altogether. (TA.) ―
-b8-  نَضَبَ is
met. used with reference to accidents [as it is
properly with respect to substances]: thus it is
said in a trad., نَضَبَ عُمْرُهُ (tropical:)  His life passed
away, or ended. (IAth.) This is what F means
by saying نَضَبَ فُلَانٌ signifies مَاتَ, (tropical:)  Such a one
died. (TA.) ―
-b9-  نَضَبَ خَيْرُهُ, inf. n. نُضُوبٌ, (tropical:)  His

-A3-
نَضَبَ, aor.
نَضُبَ, It (a thing, TA,) flowed, and ran
(K.) By our saying “ a thing,” we mean to
exclude water, though water is included in the
definition of a thing: so that we need not infer
from what is said in the K that the verb bears
two contr. significations. (TA.) [But this observation appears to me to be scarcely admissible.]
―
-b2-  نَضَبَتِ الدَّبَرَةُ [in the copies of the K in my

her udder after each previous milking. (TA.)

انضب القَوْسَ He pulled the string of the bow,
in order that it might make a sound: like أَنْبَضَهَا:
(K:) the former verb is [said to be] an original
syn. of the latter; (TA;) [and if so, it has
an inf. n., as shown below:] or he pulled
the string of the bow, and then let it go, to
make it twang: or he pulled the string of
the bow without an arrow, and then let it go,
to make it twang: (TA:) or he caused the bow
to make a sound, or twang: (AHn, L:) انضب
وَتَرَ القَوْسِ is the same as أَنْبَضَهُ, of which it is
a transp. syn. (S.) AHn, gives to it the inf. n.
إِنْضَابٌ; and yet asserts it to be formed by transposition: but this is absurd; for verbs so formed
have not inf. ns.; as mentioned by Sb and Aboo-
'Alee and the rest of the skilful grammarians.
(Abu-l-Hasan.) See قَلَبَ.

تَنْضُبٌ, a coll. gen. n., [I find it said to have
been written with tenween by J himself: but it
appears to have been also used as a generic
proper name; and as such, having the measure
of a verb, it must be written تَنْضُبُ, being
imperfectly declinable:] A certain tree: the
ت is augmentative, because there is no word of
the measure فَعْلُلٌ; whereas there are words of
the measure تَفْعُلُ, as تَقْتُلُ and تَخْرُجُ:
n. un. تَنْضُبَةٌ: (S:) a certain tree of El-Hijáz:
(K:) it grows large, in the form, or manner, of
the سَرْح, having white and thick branches; and
folds, such as are called حَظَائِر, are made of it:
[this is the only meaning I can assign to the
words وهو محتظر, supposing بِهِ to be omitted
after محنظر, though يُحْنَظَرُ would be better:]
its leaves are contracted; and it always appears
as though it were dry and dusty, though growing: (TA:) its thorns are like those of the
عَوْسَج: (K, TA:) and it has a fruit [called مَغْدٌ
(L, K, art. مغد)] like small grapes, which is
eaten, of a reddish colour: AHn says, that its
smoke is white, of the colour of dust; and that
poets therefore liken dust to it: and in one place
he says, that it is a large tree, without leaves
[properly so called], which has a trunk, and
from which grow thick boughs, with many
branches; its leaves [if such they may be called]
being only shoots, which are eaten by the camels
and sheep and goats: Aboo-Nasr says, that it is
a tree having short thorns: not of the trees that
grow on lofty mountains; frequented by chameleons: [see حِرْبَاءٌ, in art. حرب: and see an ex. in
a verse cited voce سَاقٌ:] ISd thinks that it is
thus called because of its little sap: AM says,
that it is a large tree, from which are cut tentpoles: (TA:) and Ibn-Selemeh says, that it is a
tree from which arrows are made. (S.) ―
-b2-  نُوقٌ
كَقِدَاحِ التَّنْضُبِ [She-camels like arrows made
of the wood of the tendub]. (TA).
