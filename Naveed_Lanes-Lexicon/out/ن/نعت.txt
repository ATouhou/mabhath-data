نعت1
نَعَتَ, aor.
نَعَتَ, inf. n. نَعْتٌ; and ↓ انتعت; He
described, or characterized, or designated, (S, K,)
a thing; (S;) syn. وَصَفَ: (S, K:) or he described
a thing by mentioning what was in it, or what it
possessed; whereas, in the وَصْف of a thing one
may exaggerate: (L;) (??) distinguished a person
or a thing by an epithet: and hence, he qualified
a substantive by an epithet: and he used a word
as an epithet] or he described a thing by mentioning what was in it that was good, or goodly; not
with reference to what was bad. or foul, or ugly;
unless by a straining of the meaning one say
نَعْتٌ سَوْءٌ; whereas وَصَفَ is said with respect to
what is good, or goodly and what is bad, or foul,
or ugly: (IAth: or نَعَتَ signifies he described
by mentioning the make, or form, or other outward
characteristic, as tallness and shortness; and
وَصَفَ respects action, as beating: or, accord. to
Th, نَعَتَ signifies he described by mentioning
something in some particular place in the body,
such as lameness; whereas وَصَفَ is used with
respect to what is common to the whole, as greatness, and generosity; therefore God is an object
of وَصْف, but not of نَعْت. (TA.) ―
