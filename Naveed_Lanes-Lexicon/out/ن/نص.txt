نَصَّ الشَّىْءَ, (S,) aor.
نَصُ3َ, (Mgh,) inf. n. نَصٌّ,
(Mgh, TA,) He raised the thing; syn. رَفَعَهُ
[which is here to be understood, like the English
equivalent by which I have rendered it, in several
senses, as the sequel will show]. (S, Mgh, TA.)
This is the primary signification: (TA:) or,
accord. to As, it is from نَصَّ النَّاقَةَ, q. v. infra.
(S.) You say, نَصَّ العَرُوسَ, (M, K,) or نَصَّتْهَا,
(A, Mgh,) or نَصَّها النِّسَآءُ, (Msb,) aor. as above,
(A, Mgh,) and so the inf. n., (Msb,) He, or she,
or the women, raised, (A, Msb,) or seated, (K,)
or raised and seated, (Mgh,) or showed, or displayed, (M,) the bride upon the مِنَصَّة, (M, A,
Msb, K,) or upon the مَنَصَّة. (Mgh.) And
نَصَّتِ الظَّبْيَةُ جِيدَهَا The doe-antelope raised, or
elevated, her neck. (M, TA.) And نُصَّ فُلَانٌ
سَيِّدًا (tropical:)  Such a one was set up as a lord, or chief.
(A, TA.) And نَصَّ المَتَاعَ, (M, K,) inf. n. as
above, (M,) He put the furniture, or goods, or
utensils, one upon another. (M, K.) Hence,
(TA,) نَصَّ الحَدِيثَ, (M, Msb, TA,) or نَصَّهُ إِلَى
صَاحِبِهِ, (A,) aor. and inf. n. as above, (M, Msb,
TA,) (tropical:)  He traced up, or ascribed, or attributed,
the tradition to the author thereof, resting it on
his authority, by mentioning him, or mentioning,
uninterruptedly, in ascending order, the persons
by whom it had been handed down, up to the
author; or mentioning the person who had related
it to him from the author, if only one person intervened; syn. رَفَعَهُ; (M, TA;) [i. e.] رَفَعَهُ إِلَى
مَنْ قَالَهُ: (Msb:) IAar says, (TA,) النَّصُّ signifies الإِسْنَادُ إِلَى الرَّئِيسِ الأَكْبَرِ (tropical:)  [the tracing up, or
ascribing, or attributing, a tradition, in the manner explained above, to the greatest person of
authority, here meaning Mohammad, or the author
of the tradition]; (K, TA;) [i. e.] نَصُّ الحَدِيثِ
signifies إِسْنَادُهُ وَرَفْعُهُ إِلَى الرَّئِيسِ الأَكْبَرِ. (Mgh.)
You also say, نَصَّ الحَدِيثَ إِلَيْهِ, (K,) or إِلَى فُلَانٍ,
(S,) (tropical:)  He ascribed, or attributed, or traced up,
the tradition to him, or to such a one, in the
manner explained above; syn. رَفَعَهُ. (S, K.)
See also أَنَصُّ. ―
-b2-  نَصَّ الشَّىْءَ (assumed tropical:)  He made the thing
apparent, manifest, plain, or evident; he showed
it, exhibited it, manifested it, evinced it, discovered
it, or revealed it. (M, * K.) [The verb seems
to be thus used because a thing is rendered conspicuous by being raised. See نَصَّ العَرُوسَ,
above.] ―
-b3-  [Hence, نَصَّ عَلَى شَىْءٍ مَّا, aor. and
inf. n. as above, (tropical:)  He, or it, (generally said of a
passage in the Kur. or a trad.,) made a statement, or a plain, explicit, unequivocal declaration,
respecting some, or any, particular thing, not
capable of application to any other thing: and
he mentioned something, or anything, particularly,
or specially; he particularized, or specified it by
words; very frequently used in these senses: and
such we are to understand from the saying] النَّصُّ
also signifies التَّوْقِيفُ وَالتَّعْيِينُ عَلَى شَىْءٍ مَّا: (K:)
[for which I would rather read النَّصَّ عَلَى شَىْءٍ مَّا
also signifies التَّوْقِيفُ وَالتَّعْيِينُ: adding the observation that التوقيف as syn. with النصّ is restricted
in art. وقف in the K to a special relation to the
law: and that النَّصُّ عَلَى الشَّىْءِ is often found
explained as signifying تَعْيِينُهُ; as, for instance,
in p. 377 of Har.:] these significations of النَّصُّ
are tropical, from that word as denoting “ elevation ” and “ appearance. ” (TA.) See also نَصٌّ
below. ―
-b4-  [From نَصَّهُ signifying “ he raised it,”
and consequently “ he made it apparent,” are
derived several other significations, here following.]
―
-b5-  يَنُصُّهُمْ [app. for يَنُصُّ مَا عِنْدَهُمْ] occurs in a
trad. respecting Heraclius, meaning (assumed tropical:)  He elicits,
and makes apparent, their opinion: (TA:) or
نَصَّ الرَّجُلَ, (S, M, &c.,) inf. n. as above, (M,)
signifies (tropical:)  he went to the utmost point in questioning, or asking, the man respecting a thing, (S, K,)
so as to elicit what he possessed [of information
respecting it]; (S;) i. e. (TA) (tropical:)  he importuned
the man in questioning, or asking, and urged him
to tell the utmost that he knew; (A, TA;) or (assumed tropical:)  he
questioned, or asked, the man respecting a thing
so as to elicit the utmost that he possessed [of information respecting it], (M.) [See also 3.]
―
-b6-  [In like manner you say,] نَصَّ النَّاقَةَ, (S, M,
Mgh, K,) and الدَّابَّةَ, (M, Msb,) aor. as above,
(M,) and so the inf. n., (S, M,) He made the
she-camel, and the beast, to exert herself to the
full, or to the utmost, or beyond measure, in going,
or pace; or to go the pace termed مَرْفُوع; syn.
رَفَعَهَا فِى السَّيْرِ: (M, Mgh:) or he elicited her
utmost pace; (K, TA;) from النَّصُّ as signifying
الرَّفْعُ; for the phrase رَفَعَهَا فِى السَّيْرِ necessarily
implies the eliciting the utmost of her celerity of
pace: (TA:) or he went a vehement pace so as
to elicit the utmost that she possessed [of celerity[:
(As, S:) or he put her in motion so as to elicit
her utmost pace: (A'Obeyd, TA:) or he urged,
or incited, her, and elicited her pace: (Msb:)
نَصَّ, alone, also occurs in a trad., (M, Msb,) as
meaning رَفَعَ نَاقَتَهُ: (M:) and نَاقَتَهُ ↓ نَصْنَصَ signifies the same as نَصَّهَا. (IKtt, TA.) You do
not say of a camel نَصَّ, making him the agent,
and the verb intrans. (O, * TA.) [In the M,
however, I find it said, that النَّصُّ and النَّصِيصُ
signify السَّيْرُ الشَّدِيدُ; app. indicating that they
are inf. ns., of which the verb is نَصَّ, aor., accord.
to rule,
نَصِ3َ, signifying He went a vehement pace,
or vehemently: and Golius says, as on the
authority of Ibn-Maaroof, that this verb is used
intransitively, with نَصِيصٌ for its inf. n., as signifying valide incessit: but see نَصٌّ below.] ―
-b7-
[Hence, app.,] النَّصُّ also signifies The urging or
inciting [a beast]; syn. الحَثُّ. (M.) ―
-b8-  And
نَصَّ الشَّىْءَ, (M, K,) aor.
نَصُ3َ, inf. n. نَصٌّ, (TA,) He
moved the thing; put it in motion, or into a state
of commotion; agitated it; stirred it; shook it;
(M, K;) as also ↓ نَصْنَصَهُ. (S, M, K.) Hence
the saying, فُلَانٌ يَنُصُّ أَنْفَهُ غَضَبًا (K, TA [in the
CK, incorrectly, يَنِصُّ,]) Such a one moves about
his nose by reason of anger. (TA.) And ↓ نَصْنَصَ
لِسَانَهُ He moved about his tongue; (S, M;) like
نَضْنَضَهُ; (M;) which is a dial. form; (A'Obeyd,
S;) the former being the original; the ص not
being, as some assert it to be, substituted for the
ض; for these two letters are not of the same kind
so as to be commutable. (M.)
-A2-  See also 8.

نَصَّ3َ see 3.
3
ناصّهُ, (K,) inf. n. مُنَاصَّةٌ, (TA,) He (a man,
TA) went to the utmost length with him, (namely
his creditor,) in reckoning, so as to omit nothing
therein; (K, TA;) as also ↓ نصّصهُ, (K,) inf. n.

length with him, (namely a man,) in questioning
and in reckoning. (TA.) [See also 1.]

crowded, thronged, or pressed, together. (TA.)

انتصّ He, or it, (said of a camel's hump,
Lth, TA,) became raised, or elevated, or high:
(K, TA:) or (TA) became even and erect. (Lth,
K, * TA.) [In a copy of the A, the verb in these
senses, and relating to a camel's hump, is written
نَصَّ.] You say also, انتصّت العَرُوسُ, (M, K,)
or انتصّت على المِنَصَّةِ, (A,) The bride became
raised, (A,) or seated, (K,) or shown or displayed,
(M,) upon the مِنَصَّة. (M, A, K.)
-A2-  He (a
man, TA) drew himself together; contracted himself; or shrank. (Ibn-'Abbád, K, TA.)
R. Q. 1
نَصْنَصَ, (S, M, K,) inf. n. نَصْنَصَةٌ, (Sh,
M,) He, or it, became in motion, or in a state of
commotion; became agitated, stirred, or shaken;
moved, or moved about,; bestirred himself or itself;
shook. (Sh.) He (a man) shook in his walk,
being erect. (M.) He (a camel) shook, or became in a state of commotion, in rising from the
ground. (M.) ―
-b2-  [Also,] said of a camel, it is
like حَصْحَصَ; (S;) i. e., it signifies (TA) He
(the camel) fixed, or made firm or steady, his
knees upon the ground, and put himself in motion,
or in a state of commotion, previously to rising.
(Lth, K, TA.) [See also نَضْنَضَ.] ―
-b3-  And He
(a camel) made a hollow place in the ground with
his breast, in order to lie down. (M, TA.)
-A2-
نَصْنَصَ used transitively, see 1, latter portion,
in three places.
نَصٌّ The end, or extremity, of anything; (Az,
S, M;) the utmost, or extreme, extent, term, limit,
point, or reach, of a thing: this is the primary
signification. (Az, TA.) It is said in a trad.,
(S, M,) of 'Alee, (S,) إِذَا بَلَغَ النِّسَآءُ نَصَّ الحِقَاقِ,
فَالعَصَبَةُ أَوُلَى بِهَا مِنَ الأُمِّ (S, * M, K, *) or نَصَّ
الحَقَائِقِ, (K, * TA,) but the former is that which
is commonly known; (TA;) i. e. When women
attain the period of mature intellect, (Mbr, S, K,
TA,) and know the real natures of things, (K, art.
حق,) [then the male relations on the father's side
have a better right to dispose of her in marriage
than the mother;] meaning, when they attain to
that age at which they are qualified to contend for
their rights; [accord. to the former reading;] for
this is what is termed الحِقَاق: (K, * TA:) or
when they attain to puberty: (Az, TA:) or when
they attain to that period at which they become
objects of contention for right; when every one of
the guardians asserts himself to have the best right:
(K:) or الحقاق in the trad. is a metaphorical
term, from the same word as applied to camels
[when entering upon the fourth year]; (K, * TA;)
and الحقائق, also, in this case, accord. to some,
properly signifies the same, being a pl. of حِقَّةٌ;
(TA in art. حق;) and the meaning is, when they
attain to the extreme term of childhood. (M, K.)
-A2-  In the conventional language of men of science,
it signifies (tropical:)  A thing [or statement] plainly, or
explicitly, declared, or made manifest, by God,
and his Apostle; of the measure فَعْلٌ in the sense
of the measure مَفْعُولٌ: (Msb:) or a نَصّ of the
Kur-án, and of the traditions, is an expression,
or a phrase, or a sentence, indicating a particular
meaning, not admitting any other than it: (TA:)
so in the conventional language of the lawyers
and the scholastic theologians: (MF, on the
خُطْبَة of the K:) or a statute, or an ordinance,
indicated by the manifest or plain meaning of
words of the Kur-án, and of the Sunneh: from
النَّصُّ as denoting “ elevation ” and “ appearance: ”
or, as some say, from نَصَّهُ as signifying “ he
elicited, and made apparent, his opinion. ” (TA.)
Hence, also, as used by the practical lawyers, it
signifies (tropical:)  An evidence, or a proof: (TA:) [and
particularly a text of the Kur-án, or of the Sunneh,
used as an authority in an argument, for proof of
an assertion.] The pl. [in all these senses] is
نُصُوصٌ. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  [Also, (assumed tropical:)  The text, or very
words, of an author, book, writing, or passage:
frequently used in this sense.]
-A3-  Hardness, difficulty, or straitness, of an affair, or a state, or case.
(M, TA.)
-A4-  سَيْرٌ نَصٌّ, and ↓ نَصِيصٌ, (S, K,) A
vehement pace, in which a beast is made to exert
itself to the full, or to the utmost, or beyond
measure; or in which the utmost possible celerity
is elicited; [this meaning seems to be indicated,
though not expressed, in the S;] syn. جِدٌّ رَفِيعٌ:
(K:) or, the former, as Az says, in one place, a
kind of swift pace: or, as he says in another place,
the utmost pace which a beast of carriage is able
to attain: (TA:) or نَصٌّ and ↓ نَصِيصٌ signify a
vehement pace or going. (M.) See 1.
نَصِيصٌ: see نَصٌّ, last sentence, in two places.
هَوُ نَصَّاصُ الأَنْفِ He is one who moves about his
nose [much] by reason of anger. (Ibn-'Abbád, K.)
حَيَّةٌ نَصْنَاصٌ A serpent that moves about much.
(K.) [See also نَضْنَاضٌ.]
أَنَصُّ [a comparative and superlative epithet
from نَصَّ الحَدِيثَ, q. v.]. 'Amr Ibn-Deenár
said, مَا رَأَيْتُ رَجُلًا أَنَصَّ لِلْحَدِيثِ مِنَ الزُّهْرِىِّ I
have not seen a man more skilled in tracing up,
or ascribing, or attributing, a tradition to its
author, in the manner explained above, (voce نَصَّ,)
than Ez-Zuhree; i. q. أَرْفَعَ لَهُ and أَسْنَدَ. (TA.)
مَنَصَّةٌ: see what next follows, throughout.
مِنَصَّةٌ, (S, M, A, Msb, K,) or ↓ مَنَصَّةٌ, (Mgh,)
The thing upon which a bride is raised (S, * A, K)
and seated, (Mgh,) or shown or displayed, (M,)
or upon which she stands (تقف [but this is probably a mistake for تَقْعُدُ, i. e. sits,]) when displayed
to the bridegroom, (Msb,) in order that she may
be seen (M, Mgh) [and distinguished] from among
the women; (Mgh;) being a chair, (Mgh, Msb,
TA,) or couch; (TA;) or consisting of pieces of
cloth raised, and carpets laid smoothly for a seat:
(M:) written with kesr (Msb, K) as being an
instrument, (Msb,) or with fet-h [as being a place]:
(Mgh:) accord. to some authorities, مِنَصَّةٌ and
مَنَصَّةٌ seem to signify the same thing: (TA:) or
the latter is the حَجَلَة [i. e. a kind of curtained
canopy] (K, TA) over the مِنَصَّة: (TA:) from
نَصَّ المَتَاعَ, q. v. (K.) It is said in a proverb,
وُضِعَ فُلَانٌ عَلَى المِنَصَّةِ (assumed tropical:)  Such a one was exposed
to disgrace and infamy: (TA:) or to the utmost
disgrace and infamy. (M.)
