an impression upon him with his canine tooth:
he fixed his canine teeth in him. (TA) ―
-b3-
نيّبت She (a camel) became extremely old:
(Lh, S, K:) became what is termed a ناب.

forth its root. (K.) Also signifying the same
with reference to white, or hoary hair. The
root is thought by ISd to be thus likened to a
canine tooth. (TA.) ―

تَنَيَّبَ see 2.
نَابٌ [originally نَيَبٌ, The canine tooth, or
dog-tooth; or eye-tooth; the tusk, or tush; or
the fang; of certain animals:] one of the teeth;
(S;) the tooth that is [next] behind the رَبَاعِيَة,
[or next but one to the central pair of incisors:]
(M, K.) [In this sense, the word is masc.:]
the tooth thus called is mase., when thus called:
[though if you call it سِنٌّ (???)] but ناب
when fem. signifies “ an old she-camel ”
(Msb:) or, accord. to the M and K, it is fem.
only in each of the above senses without
distinction. (TA.) Sb says, that the Arabs
observed the pronunciation termed imáleh (إِمَالَة)
in the case of ناب in the nom. [as well as in
the acc. and gen., in which latter case this
pronunciation is agreeable with analogy on
account of the final kesreh,] likening its (tropical:)  to that
in رَمَى, [in which it is expressed in writing by
ى,] because it is changed from ى: but this is
extr. That is, this pronunciation of (tropical:)  changed
from ى or و is only observed [regularly] when
the said ا is a final radical letter; and specially
in verbs: the instances of this kind that occur
in nouns are extr.; and more (???) are these in
which the ا changed from ى is a medial radical
letter. (TA.) [But the restriction to the case
of verbs is inconsistent with what is said by
Ibn-Málik and other high authorities: and so,
too, is the restriction to the case of a final
radical letter.] Pl. أَنْيُبٌ (Lh, K) and أَنْيَابٌ
[both pls. of pauc.: but the latter is used as a
pl. of mult.:] and نُيُوبٌ; (S, K;) the latter
contr. to analogy, (S,) because [نَابٌ is originally
نَيَبٌ, and] a word of the measure فَعَلٌ does not
[regularly] assume the measure فَعُولٌ in the pl.;
(TA;) to which should be added نِيُوبٌ, a dial.
var., as in the case of every pl. of the measure
فُعُولٌ of which the medial radical letter is ى:
(M, F:) and pl. pl. أَنَايِيبُ. (K, TA.) Ibn-Seenà says that no animal has both a ناب and a
horn. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  نَابٌ An aged she-camel: (S,
K:) not applied to a male camel: (S;) so called
because of the length of her lush; (S;) by
synedoche; the whole being called by the name
of a part: (TA:) as also ↓ نَيُوبٌ; (K;) accord.
to some copies of the K, نَيَّوبٌ; but this is a
mistake: (TA:) pl. of the former أَنْيَابٌ and
نُيُوبٌ (K) and نِيبٌ: (S, K:) or these are pls.
of both the former of sing. (K. accord. to some
copies; and TA.) Sb is of opinion that نِيبٌ is pl.
of ناب, and says that the Arabs have made it
of the measure فُعْلٌ [as it is said to be in the S,
for it is originally نُيْبٌ like as they have the
pl. of دَارٌ, disliking the sound of نُيُوبٌ, because
the ى is with dammeh, and preceded by dammeh, and followed by و. It is also said to be
pl. of ↓ نَيُوبٌ; as it is related, on the authority
of Yoo, that certain of the Arabs say صِيدٌ and
بِيضٌ, as pls. of صَيُودٌ and بَيُوضٌ, agreeably with
the dial. of those who say رُسْلٌ [instead of رُسُلٌ];
namely, the tribe of Temeem but their not
saying نُيُبٌ, like as they say صُيُدٌ and بُيُضٌ, is
an argument in favour of the opinion of Sb. ―
-b3-
لَا أَفْعَلُ ذٰلِكَ مَا حَنَّتِ النِّيبُ [I will not do that as
long as aged she-camels yearn towards their
young ones i. e., I will never do it]. A proverb.
(S.) ―
-b4-  The dim. of نَابٌ is نُيَيْبٌ, without ة,
because ناب, as applied to an aged she-camel, is
like an epithet: (S:) or rather this formation
of the dim. without ناب is a dev. from constant
rule. (MF.) Sh says, that some of the Arabs
make the dim. of ناب to be ثُوَيْبٌ, because many
an ا such as that in ناب is changed from و: [or
rather, this is generally the case:] but this, says
Ibn-Es-Sarráj is an error on his part [who does
(???) (S.) This apparently means, that Ibn-EsSarráj accuses Sh of an error; but such is not
the case: for Sb himself says “ but this is an
error on their part; ” i. e., on the part of the
Arabs who say نويب for نييب (IB.) ―
-b5-
نَابُ قَوْمٍ (tropical:)  The lord, master, or chief, of a people:
(S, K:) pl. أَنْيَابٌ. (TA.) ―
-b6-  عَضَّتْهُ أَنْيَابُ الدَّهْرِ,
and نُيُوبُهُ, [(tropical:)  The dog-teeth of fortune bit him].
(A.) ―
-b7-  انياب are likewise met. assigned to evil,
or mischief. (TA.)
نَيُوبٌ: see نَاب.
نُيَّبٌ [as though pl. of نَائِبٌ or نَائِبَةٌ] an
epithet added to نُيُوبٌ as signifying “ canine
teeth. ” to render the signification intensive, or
energetic. (TA.)
أَنْيَبُ Having a large, or thick, canine tooth,
(K,) that does not bite a thing without breaking it. (Th.)
