نَطْرَةٌ, with the unpointed ط, signifies The act
of guarding, or watching with the eyes: and hence
the word ↓ نَاطُورٌ. (IAar, Msb, TA.)
نَطْرُونٌ, with fet-h, [Natron;] the Armenian
بَوْرَق, or بُورَق; (thus differently written here in
different copies of the K;) or [rather] the
Egyptian بُورَق: (K, art. برق:) the best kind [of
بورق] is the Armenian, which is soft, or fragile,
light, and white: then the rose-coloured: and the
strongest is the Ifreekee: there is a kind found
in Egypt, in two places: one of these is in the
western part of the country, in the neighbourhood
of a district called Et-Tarráneh; and it is transparent, green and red; the green being the more
in request; the other is in [the district called]
El-Fákooseeyeh; and this is not so good as the
former. (TA.) [See also بَوْرَقٌ.]
نُطَّارٌ A scarecrow (خَيَالٌ) set up in the midst of
seed-produce. (Sgh, K.)

TA) نَوَاطِيرُ (Az, S, A, Msb, K) and (of the last,
TA) نِطَارٌ and نُطَرَآءُ and نَطَرَةٌ: (K:) it is a foreign
word, (أَعْجَمِىٌّ, K,) not pure Arabic, (TA,) of
the dial. of the people of Es-Sawád: (Lth, Msb,
TA:) Az says, I know not whether it be taken
from the language of the people of Es-Sawád or
be Arabic: (TA:) accord. to AHn, it is Arabic:
(TA:) and IAar says, that it is from نَطْرَةٌ,
meaning as explained above: (Msb, TA:) IDrd
says, that it is with ظ, (A, Msb,) from النَّظَرُ;
(A;) but in the language of the Nabatheans with
ط; (Msb;) that the Nabatheans change the
former letter into ط. (A.)
نَاطُورَةٌ: see نَاطُورٌ.
