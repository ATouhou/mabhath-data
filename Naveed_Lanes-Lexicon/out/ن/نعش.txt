نعش1
نَعَشَهُ, aor.
نَعَشَ, (S, K,) inf. n. نَعْشٌ, (S,) He
(God) raised him; lifted him up; (S, K;) as
also ↓ انعشهُ; (Lth, Ks, K;) which is disallowed
by ISk, who says that it is a vulgar word, and
by J after him, but is correct; (TA;) and ↓ نعّشهُ,
(AA, K,) inf. n. تَنْعِيشٌ: (AA, TA:) or He
(God) set him up, or upright; as also ↓ انعشهُ:
(Msb:) [see an ex. in a verse cited voce شَمْلٌ:]
or be [app. a man] raised him, or lifted him up,
after a stumble, or trip. (Sb.) You say also,
نَعَشْتُ الشَّجَرَةَ I set the tree upright, when it was
leaning. (TA.) And نَعَشَ طَرُفهُ He raised his
eye, or eyes. (S, * K.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] aor. and inf.
n. as above, (TA,) (tropical:)  He recovered him from his
embarrassment, or difficulty: (A:) (tropical:)  he restored
him from a state of poverty to wealth, or competence, or sufficiency: (K, TA;) as also ↓ انعشهُ:
(TA:) and (tropical:)  he recovered him from a state of
perdition or destruction. (TA.) And نَعَشَكَ اللّٰهُ
(tropical:)  May God restore thee from poverty to wealth,
or competence, or sufficiency: or make thee to continue in life; preserve thee alive. (A.) And
↓ انعشهُ (assumed tropical:)  He set him up, and strengthened his
heart. (TA.) And الرَّبِيعُ يُنْعشُ النَّاسَ (tropical:)  (A,
TA,) [The spring, or spring-herbage, or the season,
or rain, called الربيع,] makes men to live and enjoy
plenty of herbage or the like. (TA.) ―
-b3-  [Hence
also,] نَعَشَ المَيِّتَ, (Sh, K,) aor. as above, (Sh,)
and so the inf. n. (TA) (tropical:)  He eulogized, or praised,
the dead man, (Sh, K,) and exalted his praise, or
fame, or honour. (Sh.) ―
-b4-  نَعَشُوا المَيِّتَ also
signifies They carried the dead man upon the
نَعْش, q. v. (A [where this signification is indicated,
but not expressed: it is shown, however, by an
explanation of pass. part. n. (q. v. infra) in the
TA.]) ―
-b5-  نُعِشَ عَلَى جِنَارَتِهَا A نَعْش [q. v.] was
made for her bier. (Mgh, from a trad. of, or
relating to, Fátimeh.)

نَعّشهُ: see 1.
-A2-  Also, (K,) or نعّش لَهُ, (S,)
inf. n. تَنْعِيشٌ, (K,) He said to him نَعَشَكَ اللّٰهُ
[which see above, in 1, and also below, in 8]:
(S, K:) in [some copies of] the S, نَعَّشَكَ الله.
(TA.)

أَنْعَشَ see 1, in four places.

انتعش He rose; or became raised, or lifted
up: (TA:) he rose after his stumble, or trip: (S,
A, Msb, K:) and in like manner you say of a
bird, (A, TA,) meaning it rose [after falling or
alighting], (TA,) and he raised his head. (TA.)
Hence the saying, تَعَسَ فَلا انْتَعَشَ May he fall,
having stumbled, or stumble and fall, and not rise
[again]: a form of imprecation. (TA.) And
hence the saying of 'Omar, اِنْتَعِشْ نَعَشَكَ اللّٰهُ
Rise thou: may God raise thee: or نعشك اللّٰه
has here one of the two meanings assigned to it
before, in 1. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [And hence,] (tropical:)  He recovered, or became recovered, from his embarrassment, or difficulty. (A, TA.)
نَعْشٌ A state of elevation, or exaltation. (Sh.)
See 1. ―
-b2-  A state of remaining; lastingness;
endurance; permanence; or continuance; syn.
بَقَآءٌ. (Sh, K.)
-A2-  [A kind of litter, or] a thing
resembling a مِحَفَّة, upon which the king used to
be carried. when sick: (IDrd, Msb, K:) not the
نَعْش of a corpse. (IDrd, Msb.) This is said to
be the primary application. (TA) ―
-b2-  And hence,
(TA,) A bier, (S, A, Msb, K,) when the corpse
is upon it. for otherwise it is called سرِيرٌ: (S, IAth,
Msb:) it is called by the former name because of
its height, or its being raised: (S, TA.) pl.
نُعُوشٌ: (Msb:) also, a reticulated thing. (Az.
Mgh, TA,) resembling a محَفّة, (Mgh,) which is
put as a cover over a [dead] woman when she is
placed upon the bier; (Az, Mgh, TA;) but this
is properly called حَرَجٌ, though people called is
نَعْشٌ, which is properly only the bier itself. (Az,
TA.) ―
-b3-  [And hence,] بَنَاتُ نَعْشِ الكُبْرَى [or بَنَاتُ
نَعْشَ الكُبْرَى, together with نَعْشٌ or نَعْشُ, constitute
(assumed tropical:)  The constellation of Ursa Major: or the principal stars thereof:] seven stars; whereof four
[which are in the body] are called نَعْشٌ [or نَعْشُ],
and three [which are in the tail] are called بَناتٌ,
(S, K,) i. e., بنات نعش (TA:) and to like
manner الصُّغْرَى, (K,) or بنات نعش الصُّغْرَى
[together with نعش الصُّغْرَى constitute [the constellation of Ursa Minor: or the principal stars
thereof; seven in number; whereof the four in the
body are called نعش, and the there in the tail are
called بنات]: (S:) [the former four] said to be
likened to the bearers of a bier, because they form
a square: (IDrd, TA:) [the بنات being so called
as being likened to damsels or to men for بنات
is pl. of اِبْنٌ applied to an irrational thing as well
as pl. of بِنْتٌ) following a bier:] Sb and Fr agree
that نعش is imperfectly decl. because determinate
and of the fem. gender: (S:) or it is perfectly
decl. when indeterminate, but not when determinate [by having the epithet الكُبْرَى or الصُّغْرَى
added to it]: (Aboo-'Amr Ez-Záhid, K:) بَنو نَعْشِ
also occurs, in poetry; (Sb, S, K;) because a
single one [of the stars thereof] is called ابْنُ نَعْشِ,
(Lth, K,) being made to accord. in gender with
كَوْكَبٌ; but when they say ثَلَاث or أَرْبَع, they
say بَنَات: (Lth, TA:) [this is agreeable with a
general rule; accord. to which, بَنَاتٌ is the pl. of
اِبْنٌ applied to anything but a human being:]
the pl. of بنات نعش is النَّوَاعِشُ; like as أَبَارِصُ is
pl. of سَامُّ أَبَرَصَ. (L, TA.) See also نُعَيْشٌ. ―
-b4-
Also نَعْشٌ A piece of wood, (K, TA,) of the length
of twice the stature of a man, (TA,) upon the head
of which is a piece of rag, (K, TA,) called حَرَجٌ,
(TA,) with which young ostriches are hunted or
captured. (K, TA.)
نُعَيْشٌ [or نُعَيْشُ (assumed tropical:)  The small star called] السُّهَى,
which is [by the star (??)] in the middle of بَنَات نَعْش.
So in the saying, هُوَ أَخْفَى مِنْ نُعَيْش فِى بَنَاتِ نَعْش
[He, or it, is more obscure than No'eysh among
the Bená Naash]. (A, TA.)
النَّوَاعِشُ: see نَعْشٌ, near the end.
مَنْعُوشٌ A corpse carried upon a نَعْش, or bier.
(S, A, * Msb.)
نعظ &c.
