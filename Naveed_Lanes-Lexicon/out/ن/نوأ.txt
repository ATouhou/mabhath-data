نَآءَ, aor. يَنُوْءُ, inf. n. نَوْءٌ (S, K) and تَنْوَآءٌ,
(K,) He rose, or arose, with effort and difficulty.
(S, K.) ―
-b2-  نَآءَ بِحِمْلِهِ He rose with his burden
with effort and difficulty. (TA:) he rose with
his burden oppressed (??) its weight. (S, K.) ―
-b3-
تَنُوْءُبِعَجِيزَتِهَا She rises with her buttocks oppressed
by their weight: said of a woman. (S.) ―

بِصَدْرِهِ He arose. [App. said originally, if not
only, of a camel.] (TA.) ―
-b5-  نَاءَ بِهِ and ↓ اناءهُ,
It (a burden) oppressed him by its weight, and
bent him, or weighed him down. (S, K,) ―
-b6-  تَنُوْءُ
بِهَا عَجِيزَتُهَا Her buttocks oppress her by their
weight: said of a woman. (S.) ―
-b7-  نَآءَ He was
oppressed by weight, (K,) and fell down: (S, K:)
thus the verb bears two [partially] opposite significations. (K.) ―
-b8-  نَآءَ بِجَانِبِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He behaved
proudly. (TA, art. مط.) ―

or asterism, [generally said of one of those composing the Mansions of the Moon,] set (accord.
to some), or rose (accord. to others), aurorally,
i. e. at dawn of morning. (TA.) See نَوْءٌ. [It
seems that ناء is used in both these senses because
the star or asterism appears as though it were
nearly overcome by the glimmer of the dawn.]

استناء بِنَجْمٍ [He prognosticated rain &c.
by reason of the rising or setting of a star or an
asterism aurorally, i. e., at dawn of morning: or
he regarded a star or an asterism as a نَوْء].
(L.) It is said, لَا تَسْتَنِىءُ العَرَبُ بِالنُّحُومِ كُلِّهَا
[The Arabs do not prognosticate rain &c. by
reason of the auroral rising or setting of all the
stars, or asterisms: or do not regard all the
stars or asterisms as أَنْوَا. (Sh, L.) إِسْتَنْأَوْا
الوَسْمِىَّ, the ء being transposed, They expected, or
looked for, the rain called الوسمى, [from the
auroral rising or setting of a star or an
asterism]. (AHn.)
-A2-  إِسْتَنَآءَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He sought, or
asked a gift, or present of him. (K.)
نَوْءٌ, pl. أَنْوَآءٌ and نُوآنٌ, (S, K,) A star, or
an asterism, verging to setting: or the setting
of the star, or asterism, in the west, aurorally,
i. e., at dawn of morning, and the rising of
another, opposite to it, at the same time, in the
east: (K:) or the setting of one of the stars, or
asterisms, which compose the Mansions [of the
Moon (see مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ)], in the west, aurorally,
i. e., at dawn of morining, and the rising of its
رَقِيب, which is another star, or asterism, opposite
to it, at the same time, in the east, each night
for a period of thirteen days: thus does each
star, or asterism, of those Mansions, [one after
another,] to the end of the year, except الجَبْهَة,
the period of which is fourteen days: (S:) [or
it signifies the auroral rising, and sometimes the
auroral setting, of one of those stars, or asterisms;
as will be shown below: I do not say “ heliacal ”
rising because the rising here meant continues
for a period of thirteen days]. Accord. to the T,
نوء signifies the setting of one of the stars, or
asterisms, above mentioned: and AHn says,
that it signifies its first setting in the morning,
when the stars are about to disappear; which is
when the whiteness of dawn diffuses itself. (TA.)
A'Obeyd says, I have not heard نوء used in the
sense of “ setting,” “ falling,” except in this
instance. (S.) It is added, [whether on his or
another's authority is doubtful,] that the [pagan]
Arabs used to attribute the rains and winds and
heat and cold to such of the stars, or asterisms,
above mentioned as was setting at the time
[aurorally]; or, accord. to As, to that which
was rising in its ascendency [aurorally]; and
used to say, مُطِرْنَا بِنَوْءِ كَذَا [We have been given
rain by such a نوء]; (S;) or they attributed heat
[and cold] to the rising or the star or asterism,
and rain [and wind], to its نَوْء [meaning its
setting]. (AHn, Har, p. 216.) This the Muslim
is forbidden to say, unless he mean thereby,
“ We have been given rain at the period of such
a نوء; ” God having made it usual for rain to
come at [certain of] the periods called انواء.
Again, A'Obeyd says, The انواء are twenty-eight
stars, or asterisms; sing. نوء: the rising of any
one of them in the east [aurorally] is called نوء;
and the star, or asterism, itself is hence thus
called: but sometimes نوء signifies the setting.
Also, in the L it is said, that each of the abovementioned stars, or asterisms, is called thus because, when that in the west sets, the opposite
one rises; and this rising is called النّوء; but
some make نوء to signify the setting; as if it
bore contr. senses. (TA.) [El-Kazweenee mentions certain physical occurrences on the occasions
of the انواء of the Mansions of the Moon; and in
each of these cases, except three, the نوء is the
rising, not the setting. Two of the excepted
cases are doubtful: the passage relating to the
third plainly expresses an event which happens
at the period of the auroral setting of الصَّرْفَة;
namely the commencement of the days called
أَيَّامُ العَجُوزِ; corresponding, accord. to ElMakreezee, with the rising of الفَرْغُ المُقَدَّمُ, the
رقيب of الصرفة: and it is said in the S, art. عجز,
on the authority of Ibn-Kunáseh, that the ايّام
العجوز fall at the period of the نوء of الصرفة.
(The auroral setting of الصرفة, at the commencement of the era of the Flight, in central
Arabia, happened about the 9th of March O. S.;
and this is the day of the N. S., the 26th of
February O. S., on which commence the ايّام
العجوز accord. to the modern Egyptian almanacs.)
Hence it appears, that sometimes the setting, but
generally the rising, was called the نوء. Moreover, the ancient Arabs had twenty-eight proverbial sayings (which are quoted in the Mir-át
ez-Zemán, and in the work of El-Kazweenee)
relating to the risings of the twenty-eight Mansions of the Moon: such as this: إِذَا طَلَعَ الشَّرَطَانْ
إِسْتَوَى الزَّمَانْ “ When Esh-Sharatán rises, the
season becomes temperate: ” or, perhaps, “―
-b2-
the night and day, become equal. ” (If this
latter meaning could be proved to be the right
one, we might infer that the Calendar of the
Mansions of the Moon was in use more than
twelve centuries B. c.; and that for this reason
الشرطان was called the first of the mansions;
though it may have been first so called at a
later period as being the first Mansion in the
first Sign of the Zodiac. But I return to the
more immediate object which I had in view in
mentioning the foregoing sayings.) I do not
find any of these sayings (though others, I
believe, do) relating to the settings. Hence, again,
it appears most probable, that the rising, not the
setting, was generally called نوء.] ―
-b3-  [In many
instances,] الأَنْوَآءُ signifies The Mansions of the
Moon [themselves]; and نَوْءٌ, any one of those
Mansions: and they are also called نُجُومُ المَطَرِ
[the stars, or asterisms, of rain]. (Mgh, in art.
خطأ.) IAar says that the term نوء was not
applied except in the case of a star, or asterism,
accompanied by rain: (TA:) [see exs. under
خَطَّ and خَطَّأَ: but most authors, it seems, apply
this term without such restriction: it is sometimes given to certain stars or asterisms, which
do not belong to the Mansions of the Moon; as
will be seen below: and it is applied, with the
article, especially to الثُّرَيَّا]. ―
-b4-  Accord. to AZ,
as cited by AM, the first rain is that called
الوَسْمِىُّ: the انواء of which are those called
العَرْقُوَتَانِ المُؤَخَّرَتَان, the same, says AM, as الفَرْغُ
المُؤَخَّرُ, [the 27th Mansion of the Moon, which,
about the period of the commencement of the era
of the Flight, (to which period, or thereabout,
the calculation of AZ, here given, most probably
relates,) set aurorally, (for by the term نوء AZ
means a star or asterism, at the setting of which
rain usually falls,) in central Arabia, on the 21st
of Sept. O. S, as shewn in the observations on
the منازل القمر in this lexicon]: then, الشَّرَطُ,
[one of the شَرَطَانِ, the 1st Mansion, which, about
the period above mentioned, set aurorally on the
17th of Oct.]: then, الثُّرَيَّا, [the 3rd Mansion,
which, about that period, set on the 12th of
Nov.]. Then comes the rain called الشَّتَوِىُّ: the
انواء of which are الجَوْزَاءُ [meaning الهَقْعَةُ, the
5th Mansion, which, about the period above
mentioned, set aurorally on the 8th of Dec.]
then, الذِّرَاعَانِ, [i. e. الذِّرَاعُ المَقْبُوضَةُ and الدِّرَاعُ
المَبْسُوطَةُ; the former of which, about the same
period, set anti-heliacally on the 3rd of January,
the proper relative time of the setting of the 7th
Mansion; and the latter, on the 16th of January,
the proper relative time of the setting of the 8th
Mansion;] and their نَثْرَة, [the 8th Mansion,
which, about that period, set aurorally on the
16th of Jan.]: then, الجَبْهَةُ, [the 10th Mansion,
which set aurorally, about that period, on the
11th of Feb.] In this period the شتوى rain
ends; and that called الدَّفَئِىُّ (q. v.) begins, and
[after this] الصَّيْفُ. All the rains from the وسمى
to the دفئى are called رَبِيعٌ. Then, [after the
دفئى,] comes the صَيْف: the انواء of which are
السِّمَاكَانِ (الأَعْزَلُ and الرَّقِيبُ); [the former of
which is, accord. to El-Kazweenee, the 14th
Mansion, which, about the period above mentioned, set aurorally on the 4th of April: the
latter seems to be the رقيب of الثريّا (see رقيب):
i. e. الإِكْلِيلُ, the 17th Mansion, which, about the
same period, set aurorally on the 13th of May;
a period of about forty days. Then comes الحَميمُ.
[see this word, said by some to be] a period of
about twenty nights, commencing at the [auroral]
rising of الدَّبَرَان, [at the epoch of the Flight
about the 26th of May, O. S.,] which has [little
rain, or none, and is therefore said to have] ??
نوء. Then comes الخَريفُ [a period of little rain
the انواء of which are النَّسْرَانِ [or the two vultures, النَّسْرُ الوَاقِعُ and النَّسْرُ الطَّائِرُ, which, in
central Arabia, about the period above mentioned,
set aurorally on the 24th of July, O. S., both
together]: then, الخضر, [which I have not been
able to identify with any known star or asterism,
in the TT with صح written above it, to denote
its being correctly transcribed]: then, العَرْقُوَتَانِ
الأُولَيانِ, the same says AM, as الفَرْغُ المُقَدَّمُ,
the 26th Mansion, which, about the same period,
set on the 8th of Sept.]. (T, TT, TA. *) ―
-b5-
[Hence,] نَوْءٌ [also means (assumed tropical:)  The supposed effect of
a star or asterism so termed in bringing rain &c.:
whence the phrase لَا نَوْءَ لَهُ It has no effect upon
the weather; said of a particular star or
asterism: see البُطَيْنُ. ―
-b6-  Also. Rain consequent
upon the annual setting or rising of a star so
termed (assumed tropical:)  so in many instances in Kzw's account
of the Mansions of the Moon.] And (tropical:)  Herbs, or
herbage: so called because regarded as the consequence of what is [more properly] termed نوء:
[i. e., the auroral setting or rising of a star or
asterism, or the rain supposed to be produced
thereby.] Ex. جَفُّ النَّوْءُ The herbage dried up.
(IKt.) Also, (tropical:)  A gift, or present. (K.)
أَنْوَأُ More, or most, acquainted with the أَنْوَآء
(K, and some copies of the S) [See نَوْءٌ, It
is an anomalous word, though of a kind of
which there are some other examples, for it has
no verb] and, by only, a noun of this class is
not formed but from a verb. (TA)
مُسْتَبَآءٌ (assumed tropical:)  One of whom a gift, or present, is
sought, or asked, (K.)
