نظر1
نَظَرَ إِلَيْهِ, (S, M, A, Msb, K,) and نَظَرَهُ, (M,
A, Msb, K,) aor.
نَظُرَ, (M, A, &c.,) and أَنْطُورٌ is
substituted for أَنْظُرُ in the dial. of certain Arabs,
(IDrd, TS, K,) or, accord. to Lb, in the Bughyetel-Ámál, the و is here added only [by poetic
license,] to make the sound of the dammeh full,
agreeably with other instances; (TA;) and
نَظِرَ إِلَيْهِ, and نَظِرَهُ, aor.
نَظَرَ, (A, K,) the verb being
like سَمِعَ accord. to the correct copies of the K,
[and so in the A,] but in one copy of the K, like
ضَرَبَ; (TA;) inf. n. نَظَرٌ, (S, M, A, Msb, K,)
and نَظْرٌ is allowable, as a contraction of the
former, (Lth,) and نَظَرَانٌ (S, K,) and مَنْظَرٌ (M,
A, K) and مَنْظَرَةٌ and تَنْظارٌ, (M, K,) [which last
is an intensive form; He looked at, or towards,
in order to see, him, or it;] he considered, or
viewed, him or it with his eye; (S, A, K;) with
the sight of the eye; (Msb;) [i. e. looked at him
or it;] as also ↓ تنظّرهُ: (K:) and ↓ انتظرهُ signifies the same as تنظّرهُ and نَظَرَهُ [but app. in
another sense, to be mentioned below, and not in
the sense explained above, though the latter is
implied in the TA; and the same may be meant
when it is said that ↓ تنظّر is syn. with نَظَرَ, if this
assertion, which I find in the M, have been copied
without consideration, and be not confirmed by
an example]: (TA:) or نَظَرَ إِلَيْهِ signifies he
extended, or stretched, or raised, [or directed,] his
sight towards him or it, whether he saw him or
did not see him. (TA.) The usage of النَّظَرٌ as
relating to the sight is most common with the
vulgar, but not with persons of distinction, who use
it more in another sense, to be explained below.
(TA.) You say, نَظَرَ إِلَيْهِ نَظْرَةً حُلْوَةً [He looked
at him, or towards him, with one sweet look.]
(A.) And نَظَرَ فِى المِنْظَارِ [He looked in the
mirror]. (A.) And نَظَرَ فِى الكِتَابِ [He looked
into, or inspected, the writing or book], (A, Msb,)
which is for نَظَرَ المَكْتُوبَ فِى الكِتَابِ [he looked
at what was written in the writing or book], or
has a different meaning to be explained below.
(Msb.) And هُوَ يَنْظُرُ حَوْلَهُ [lit., He looks around
him; meaning,] he looks much. (A.) [See also
نَظَرٌ below.] ―
-b2-  نَظَرَتِ الأَرْضُ, (Sgh, K,) and
نَظَرَتِ الأَرْضُ بِعَيْنٍ, and بِعَيْنَيْنِ, (A,) (tropical:)  The earth,
or land, showed (A, Sgh, K) to the eye (Sgh, K)
its plants or herbage. (A, Sgh, K.) ―
-b3-  نَظَرَ إِلَيْهِ
(tropical:)  It looked towards, meaning faced, him or it.
So in the Kur, [vii. 197,] وَتَرَاهُمْ يَنْظُرُونَ إِلَيْكَ وَهُمْ
لَا يُبْصِرُونَ (tropical:)  Thou seest them look towards thee,
i. e., face thee, but they see not; referring to idols,
accord. to A'Obeyd. (TA.) And you say,
دَارِى يَنْظُرُ إِلَى دَارِ فُلَانٍ (tropical:)  My house faces the house
of such a one. (S.) And نَظَرَ إِلَيْكَ الجَبَلُ (tropical:)  The
mountain faced thee: (A:) as in the following ex.:
إِذَا أَخَذْتَ فِى طَرِيقِ كَذَا فَنَظَرَ إِلَيْكَ الجَبَلُ فَخُذْ
عَنْ يَمِينِهِ أَوْيَسَارِهِ (tropical:)  [When thou takest such a
road, and the mountain faces thee, then take thou
the way by the right of it or the left of it.] (S.)
―
-b4-  [Hence, perhaps,] نَظَرَ الدَّهْرُ إِلَى بَنِى فُلَانٍ
فَأَهْلَكَهُمْ [app. meaning, (assumed tropical:)  Fortune opposed the
sons of such a one and destroyed them]: (S [immediately following there the ex. which immediately
precedes it here:]) or نَظَرَ إِلَيْهِمُ الدَّهْرُ signifies
(tropical:)  Fortune destroyed them: (M, A:) but (says
ISd) I am not certain of this. (M.) ―
-b5-  النَّظَرُ
also signifies (assumed tropical:)  The turning the mind in various
directions in order to perceive a thing [mentally],
and the seeing a thing: and sometimes it means
(assumed tropical:)  the considering and investigating: [and as a
subst., speculation, or intellectual examination:]
and sometimes, (assumed tropical:)  the knowledge that results from
[speculation or] investigation. (El-Basáïr.) It
is mostly used as relating to the intellect by
persons of distinction; and as relating to the
sight, most commonly by the vulgar. (TA.)
[It is said that] when you say نَظَرْتُ إِلَيْهِ, it
means only [I looked at, or towards, him or it]
with the eye: but when you say نَظَرْتُ فِى الأَمْرِ,
it may mean [(assumed tropical:)  I looked into, inspected, examined,
or investigated, the thing or affair] by thought
and consideration, intellectually, or with the mind:
(TA:) [this remark, however, is not altogether
correct, as may be seen from what follows: the
truth seems to be, that نَظَرَهُ and نَظَرَإِلَيْهِ may be
used in the latter of these two senses, though
نَظَرَ فِيهِ is most common in this sense.] It is said
in the Kur, [x. 101,] قُلِ انْظُرُوا مَا ذَا فِى السَّمٰوَاتِ
(assumed tropical:)  Say, Consider ye what is in the heavens. (TA.)
And you say, نَظَرَ إِلَيْهِ He saw it, and (assumed tropical:)  thought
upon it, and endeavoured to understand it, or to
know its result. (TA.) [And He looked to it,
or at it, or examined it, intellectually; regarded
it; had a view to it.] And نَظَرَ فِيهِ (assumed tropical:)  He considered it: (TA:) or thought upon it; namely a
writing or book; or when such is the object it
may have another meaning, explained before;
and an affair: and with this is held to accord the
saying وَفِيهِ نَظَرٌ, q. v. infrà, voce نَظَرٌ: (Msb:)
and (tropical:)  he though upon it, measuring it, or comparing it. (M, K, TK. In the M and K, only
the inf. n., نَظَرَ فِى أَمْوَالِ الأَيْتَامِ, of the verb in this sense is mentioned.) And فَنَطَرَ نَظْرَةً فِى النُّجُومِ (assumed tropical:)  He considered, or examined, [or estimated,] the possessions
of the orphans, in order to know them. (Msb.)
And similar to this is the phrase [in the Kur,
xxxvii. 86,] النَّظَرُ, meaning, (assumed tropical:)  And
he examined the science of the stars: (Msb:) [or
he took a mental view of the stars, as if to divine
from them.] الاِعْتِبَارُ when used unrestrictedly by
those who treat of scholastic theology means
الاِعْتِبَارُ [(assumed tropical:)  The thinking upon a thing, and endeavouring to understand it, or to know its result;
or judging of what is hidden from what is apparent; or reasoning from analogy]. (MF.)

-b9-
أُنْظُرْنِى (assumed tropical:)  Listen thou to me. (M, K, TA [in the
CK, erroneously, أُنْطِرْنِى.]) The verb [says
ISd] has this meaning in the Kur, ii. 98. (M.)
―
-b10-  أَنَا أَنْظُرُ إِلَى اللّٰهِ ثُمَّ إِلَيْكَ [lit., I look to God,
then to thee; meaning,] (tropical:)  I look for the bounty of
God, then for thy bounty. (A.) ―
-b11-  نَظَرَ اللّٰهُ إِلَيْهِ
(tropical:)  God chose him, and compassionated him, pitied
him, or regarded him with mercy; because looking
at another is indicative of love, and not doing so
is indicative of hatred: (IAth:) or (assumed tropical:)  God bestowed
benefits upon him; poured blessings, or favours,
upon him: (El-Basáïr:) and نَظَرَ لَهُمْ (tropical:)  he compassionated them, and aided them; (Sgh, K;)
and simply, he aided them: (K, * TA:) and نَظَرَ لَهُ
(assumed tropical:)  he accomplished his want, or that which he

-b2-  Also syn. with أَنْظَرَهُ, q. v.
―
-b3-  Also نَظَرَهُ, (K, TA,) inf. n. نَظْرٌ; (TA;) or
↓ نَظَّرَهُ; (so in a copy of the M, and in the CK;
but from the mention of the inf. n. in the TA, the
former seems to be the right reading;) He sold
it (a thing, M) with postponement of the payment;
he sold it upon credit. (M, * K, * TA.) See also
4. ―
-b4-  [In these last three acceptations, accord. to
the A, the verb is used properly, not tropically.]

termed a نَظْرَة; (K, TA;) i. e., a stroke of an
[evil] eye; (TA;) [or of an evil eye cast by a

مناظرة signifies the examining mentally, or investigating, by two parties, the relation between two
things, in order to evince the truth; (KT; and
Kull, p. 342;) and sometimes with one's self;
but مجادلة signifies the disputing respecting a

the opponent, whether what he says be wrong in
itself or not. (Kull.) ―

Hence the saying of Ez-Zuhree, (K,) Mohammad
Ibn-Shiháb, (TA,) لَا تُنَاظِرْ بِكِتَابِ اللّٰهِ وَلَا بِكَلَامِ
رَسُولِ اللّٰهِ, i. e., Thou shalt not call anything like
the book of God, nor like the words of the apostle
of God: (A'Obeyd, T, K:) or thou shalt not
compare anything, nor call anything like, to the
book of God, &c.: (A,) or thou shalt not apply
[aught of] the book of God, nor the words of the
apostle of God, as a proverb to a thing that
happens: (A'Obeyd, T, K; in which last, we
read لِشَىْءٍ لِغَرَضٍ, in the place of the right reading,
لِشَىْءٍ يَعْرِضُ: TA:) for, as Ibráheem En-Nakha'ee
says, they used to dislike the mentioning a verse
of the Kur-án on the occasion of anything happening, of worldly events; (T;) as a person's
saying to one who has come at a time desired by
the former, (TA,) or to one named Moosà, who
has come at a time desired, (K,) جِئْتَ عَلَى قَدَرٍ يَا
مُوسَى [Thou hast come at a time appointed, O
Moosà: (Kur, xx. 42:)] (T, K:) and the like:
(T:) but the first explanation is the most probable
(TA, as from Az; but I do not find it in the T)

أُنْظِرَ بِهِ (tropical:)  [He, or it, was made like]. You

نَظُرَ, T &c., inf. n. نَظَرٌ S, K) signifies
the same; (T, M, A, Msb, K;) and so ↓ تنظرّهُ,
(M, A, K,) and ↓ أَنْظَرَهُ; (Zj, TA;) [but respecting the last two, see what is said below:] but
when you say انتظر without any objective complement, the meaning is, [he waited; or] he
