نسر1
نَسَرَ, aor.
نَسُرَ (S, M, K) and
نَسِرَ, (M, K,) inf.
n. نَسْرٌ, (S, M, K,) He (a bird, M, K, or a hawk
or falcon, S, [or other bird, see نَسْرٌ below,])
plucked flesh (S, M, K) with his beak. (S, TA.)
You say also, نَسَرَهُ بِمِنْسَرِهِ, meaning, He (a hawk
or falcon [or other bird]) plucked his flesh with his
beak. (A.)
-A2-  [Hence,] نَسَرَهُ (tropical:)  He blamed him;
found fault with him; spoke evil of him behind his
back, or in his absence, saying of him what would
grieve him if he heard it. (A.)

استنسر He (the بَغَاث [or ignoble bird, or
most ignoble of birds,] S, M) became a نَسْر [or
vulture]: (M:) or became like the نَسْر (S, K) in
strength. (K.) Hence the proverb, إِنَّ البَغَاثَ
بِأَرْضِنَا يَسْتَنْسِرُ [Verily the most ignoble bird, or
most ignoble birds, in our land becomes like the
vulture, or become like vultures]: (S, M:) meaning,
the weak among us becomes strong. (S.) See
also art. بغث.
نَسْرٌ (S, M, Msb, K, &c.) and sometimes ↓ نِسْرٌ
[agreeably with the modern general pronunciation]
and ↓ نُسْرٌ, (Sheykh-el-Islám Zekereeyà, in his
Comm. on the Expos. of Bd,) but this is very
strange, (MF,) [The vulture; app. any vulture,
whatever be its species or variety, known to the
Arabs, except the رَخَم, or aquiline vulture; and
said to be applied by some of the Arabs to the
eagle; (see also نُسَارِيَّةٌ;) agreeing with the
Hebrew
נֶשֶׁר, which is plainly applied to the
former bird in Micah, i. 16, and probably in other
instances;] a certain bird, (S, M, A, Msb, K,)
well known; (A, Msb;) so called because it
plucks (يَنْسُِرُ) a thing, and swallows it, (A, and
so in some copies of the K,) or, and pulls it out
(so in some copies of the K,) or, and chases and
captures it; (so in some copies of the K; the
various readings being وَيَبْتَلِعُهُ and وَيَقْتَلِعُهُ and
وَيَقْتَنِصُهُ;) it is said that it has no مِخْلَب [or
talon], but only the ظُفْر [or nail], like that of the
domestic cock and hen, and of the crow and the
like, and of the رَخَمَة [or aquiline vulture]: (S:)
the bird called in Persian كَرْكَشْ, which eats
carcases until it is unable to fly, and is said to live
a thousand years: (Kzw:) AHn asserts, that
the نسر is a bird of the description called عِتَاق;
[which is a term applied to birds of prey, and to
noble birds, (in a sense wider than that in which
this appellation is used in English falconry,) and
especially to eagles;] but [ISd says] I know not
how that is: (M:) pl. (of pauc., S) أَنْسُرٌ and (of
mult., S) نُسُورٌ. (S, M, Msb, K.) ―
-b2-  النَّسْرُ الوَاقِعُ
(assumed tropical:)  [The Falling, or Alighting, Vulture,] and
النَّسْرُ الطَّائِرُ (assumed tropical:)  [The Flying Vulture,] are two stars
or asterisms, (S, * M, A, Msb, K,) well-known,
(M,) which together are called النَّسْرَانِ [the Two
Vultures], (M, A,) and each of which alone is
called النَّسْرُ (M, Msb, K) and نَسْرٌ; (M;) being
likened to the bird so named: (M:) the former is
the bright star [a] in the constellation الشَّلْيَاقُ [or
Lyra] likened by the Arabs to a vulture (نسر) that
has contracted its wings to itself, as though it had
alighted upon something: and the latter consists of
the three well-known stars [a and b and g] in the
constellation العُقَابُ [or Aquila]: (Kzw:) [The
former rose heliacally, about the epoch of the
Flight, in central Arabia, on the 25th of November, O. S., with the Eighteenth Mansion of the
Moon, which is a of Scorpio; and the latter, on
the 28th of December, O. S.: and both set, together, anti-heliacally, at that period and in that
part, on the 24th of July, O. S. See نَوْءٌ, and
دَبُورٌ.]
-A2-  نَسْرٌ (S, M, Msb) and النَّسْرُ, (S, M, K,)
the latter occurring in a verse cited in art. عز, (S,)
A certain idol, (S, M, Msb, K,) belonging to
Dhu-l-Kelaa, (S, Msb, K,) in the land of Himyer,
(S, K,) as يَغُوثُ did to Medhhij, and يَعُوقُ to Hemdán, of the idols of the people of Noah, (S,) all of
which are mentioned in the Kur, lxxii. 22 and 23:
(S, M:) or a certain good man, who lived between
Adam and Noah, and of whom, after his death,
was made an image, which, after a long time,
became an object of worship; like وَدٌّ and سُوَاعٌ and
يَغُوثُ, and يَعُوقُ, mentioned therewith in the Kur,
ubi supra. (Bd.)
-A3-  Also, نَسْرٌ [The frog, or
frush, of the hoof of a horse or ass or mule; thus
called in the present day;] a portion of tough
flesh, [or rather a horny substance,] in the بطْن
[or sole] of the solid hoof, as though it were a datestone, [which it resembles in substance,] or a
pebble: (S:) or the flesh of the solid hoof, which
the poets liken to date-stones: (T:) or a portion
of flesh, (K,) or of hard flesh, (M,) in the بَاطِن
[or sole, or inner part,] of the solid hoof, (M, K,
TA,) as though it were a pebble, or a date-stone,
(TA:) or what rises in the باطن of the hoof of the
horse, from, or of, the upper part thereof: (M,
K:) or the باطن itself of the solid hoof: (M:)
pl. نُسُورٌ, (M, K,) which Aboo-Sa'eed explains
as signifying the prominences in the بَطْن [or sole]
of the solid hoof, which are likened to date-stones
because of their hardness, and which do not touch
the ground. (TA.) Hence the saying, حَافِرٌ صُلْبُ
النُّسُورِ [A solid hoof hard in the frog: the sing.
and pl. being used indiscriminately]. (TA.)
نُسْرٌ: see نَسْرٌ, first signification.
نِسْرٌ: see نَسْرٌ, first signification.
نِسْرِينٌ [The wild rose, dog-rose, eglantine, or
sweet brier: so in the present day: and, accord. to
Spreng., Hist. Rei Herb., cited by Freytag, the
jonquil:] a well-known rose; (K;) a well-known
sweet-smelling flower; (Msb;) a species of sweetsmelling flower; (M;) a Persian word, (M, Msb,)
arabicized: (Msb:) of the measure فِعْلِيل; and,
if so, the [final] ن is radical: or of the measure
فِعلِينٌ; and if so, that letter is augmentative:
Az says, I know not whether it be Arabic or not.
(Msb.)
نُسَارِيَّةٌ The eagle; syn. عُقَابٌ: (IAar, K:)
likened to the نَسْر. (IAar, TA.) [Hence it
appears that, accord. to IAar, the نَسْر is not the
eagle.]
نَاسُورٌ (also written with ص, S, Msb,) A certain
disease that happens in the inner angles of the
eyes, (S, Msb, K,) with an incessant defluxion
therefrom: (S, TA:) and sometimes it happens
also in the part around the anus: and in the gum:
(S, Msb:) or it signifies also a certain disease in
the part around the anus: and a certain disease
in the gum: (K:) and is an arabicized word
[from the Persian]: (S, Msb:) نَوَاصِير, pl. of
نَاصُورٌ, accord. to certain of the physicians, is a
term applied to deep ulcers in the anus, at the
extremity of the gut. (Msb, art. نصر.) ―
-b2-
Also, A vein constantly becoming recrudescent,
(عِرْقٌ غَبِرٌ,) with an incessant defluxion; (S, K;) corrupt within; whenever its upper part heals, breaking forth again with corruption. (TA.) See also
غَرْبٌ.
مِنْسَرٌ (S, A, Msb, K) and ↓ مَنْسِرٌ, (Msb, K,) or
the former only, (AZ,) The beak of a bird (S, A,
Msb, K) of prey; (S, Msb;) or of a hawk or
falcon; (A;) that of any other bird being called
مِنْقَارٌ. (S, Msb.)
-A2-  [Hence,] ↓ both words also
signify (assumed tropical:)  A portion of an army that goes before
the main army: (S, K:) [likened to the beak of
a bird of prey; as the side bodies are likened to
the wings:] and a troop of horse or horsemen in
number from thirty to forty: or from forty to
fifty: or from forty to sixty: (M, K:) or from a
hundred to two hundred: (M, Msb, K:) or a
troop of horse or horsemen: (El-Farábee, Msb:)
or an army that does not pass by anything without
snatching it away. (Msb.)
