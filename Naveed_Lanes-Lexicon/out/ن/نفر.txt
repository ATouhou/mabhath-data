or نُفُورٌ, (Msb,) said of a wild animal, (T,
Msb,) a gazelle, (M, K,) or other beast, (M,)
He took fright, and fled, or ran away at
random; or became refractory, and went away
at random; or ran away, or broke loose, and
went hither and thither by reason of his sprightliness; syn. شَرَدَ; (M, K;) as also ↓ استنفر;
(T, Msb, K;) and so the former verb in
speaking of a camel, or a beast: (L, art. شرد:)
you say, نَفَرَتِ الدَّابَّةُ, (T, S, M, A, K,) aor.
نَفِرَ
and
نَفُرَ, (T, S, M, K,) inf. n. نُفُورٌ and نِفَارٌ (T,
S, M, A, K) and نَفْرٌ: (A:) or this signifies
the beast was, or became, impatient (A, K, TA)
of or at a thing, (TA,) [or shied at it,] and
retired to a distance; (A, K, TA;) and ↓ إِسْتِنْفَارٌ
signifies the same as نُفُورٌ: (S:) or نَفَرَ, inf. n.
نِفَارٌ [and نُفُورٌ], signifies he fled, and went away

-b2-
[Hence, نَفَرَ, aor.
نَفِرَ and
نَفُرَ, inf. n. نُفُورٌ and نِفَارٌ
and نَفْرٌ and نَفِيرٌ, as used in the following
phrases.] نَفَرْتُ مِنْ هٰذَا الأَمْرِ (tropical:)  I shrank from
this thing or affair; was averse from it; did
not like or approve it. And نَفَرَ فُلَانٌ مِنْ صُحْبَةِ
فُلَانٍ (tropical:)  [Such a one shrank, or was averse, from
the companionship of, or the associating with,
such a one]. And نَفَرَتِ المَرْأَةُ مِنْ زَوْجِهَا (tropical:)  [The
woman was averse from her husband; or shunned
or avoided him]. (All from the A.) And you
say of a man's disposition, عَنِ الحَقِّ ↓ تَنَفَّرَ
(tropical:)  [It shunned, or was averse from, the truth]
(Bd, lxvii. 21.) ―
-b3-  إِلَّا نُفُورًا, in the Kur, [xvii.
43, and xxxv. 40,] means (tropical:)  Save in aversion
and نَفِيرٌ is like نُفُورٌ: and the subst. is نَفَرٌ, with
two fet-hahs. (Msb) ―
-b4-  نَفَرَ الشَّىْءُ مِنَ الشَّىْءِ
inf. n. نِفَارٌ [and نُفُورٌ], The thing receded, withdrew, removed, or became remote or aloof, from
the thing. (A'Obeyd, T, S.) [See also 3.] ―
-b5-
Hence it is, I think, that نَفَرَ is used as signifying (tropical:)  It became swollen, in the following
words of a trad. of 'Omar: تَخَلَّلَ رَجُلٌ فِى زَمَانِهِ
بِالقَصَبِ فَنَفَرَ فُوهُ (tropical:)  A man, in his time, picked
his teeth with reeds, and in consequence his
mouth became swollen: as though the flesh,
disliking the disease, receded from it, and so
became swollen. (A'Obeyd, T, S. *) You say
also, نَفَرَتِ العَيْنُ, aor.
نَفِرَ and
نَفُرَ, inf. n. نُفُورٌ. (tropical:)  His
eye became inflamed and swollen: and so you
say of other parts of the person. (M, K. *)
And نَفَرَ الجُرْحُ, inf. n. as above, (tropical:)  The wound
became swollen: (T, Msb:) or it became so after
healing. (W, i. 42.) And نَفَرَ الجِلْدُ (tropical:)  The
skin became swollen, (S, A,) and the flesh receded
from it. (A.) [All these significations seem
to be derived from the first in this art.: and

inf. n. نِفَارٌ, I betook myself to God by reason of
fear, seeking protection. (IKtt) ―
-b7-  نَفَرُوا, (Msb,)
inf. n. نَفْرٌ, (M, Msb, K,) They became separated,
or dispersed: (M, * Msb, K: *) and so نَفَرتْ,
said of camels. (TA.) Hence, (M,) the
saying, لَقِيتُهُ قَبْلَ كُلِّ صَيْحٍ وَنَفْرٍ, (S, M, A.)
a proverb, in which the last word is used
tropically; (A;) explained in art. صيح, q. v.
(S.) [And غَضِبَ مِنْ غَيْرِ صَيْحٍ وَلَا نَفٍرْ; explained in the same art.] ―
-b8-  نَفَرَ الحَاجُّ مِنْ مِنًى,
(M, Msb, K,) aor.

(M, Msb, K) and نَفَرٌ (M) and نُفُورٌ (K) [and
نَفِيرٌ], The pilgrims removed from Minè. (Msb.)
Hence, يَوْمُ النَّفْرِ, and النَّفَرِ, and النَّفُورِ, and النَّفِيرِ,
(S, M, K,) and لَيْلَةُ النَّفْرِ, (S, TA,) and النَّفَرِ,
(TA,) [The day of, and the night immediately
preceding, the removing from Minè]; after the
day called يَوْمُ القَرِّ: (S;) [therefore. the twelfth
of Dhu-l-Hijjeh:] or there are two days thus
called: (Msb:) يَوْمُ النَّفْرِ الأَوَّلُ is [the day above
mentioned,] the second of the days called أَيَّامُ
التَّشْرِيقِ; (IAth, Msb;) and يَوْمُ النَّفْر الاّخِرُ,
(IAth,) or الثَّانِى, (Msb,) is the third thereof:
(IAth, Msb:) the order is this; يَوْمُ النَّحْرِ,
then يَوْمُ القَرِّ, then يَوْمُ النَّفْر الأَوَّلُ then يَوْمُ
النَّفْرِ الآخِرُ. (T, L) ―
-b9-  نَفَرُوا فِى الأَمْرِ, (S, M.)
or لِلْأَمْرِ, (K,) aor.
نَفِرَ, (M, K.) inf. n. نُفُورٌ (S, M,
K) and نِفارٌ (M, K) and نَفِيرٌ; (Zj, M, K;) and
↓ تنافروا; (M, K;) They went, or went away,
to execute the affair: (M, K:) and in like
manner, فِى القِتَالِ to fight. (M.) And نَقَرُوا,
alone, They went forth to war against unbelievers
or the like. So in the Kur, is 82. وَقَالوا لَا تَنْفِرُوا
فى الحرِّ قُلْ نَارٌ جَهَنَّمَ أَشَدٌ حَرَّا [And they said,
Go not ye forth to war against the unbelievers in
the heat: say, The fire of hell is hotter]: and
so in the same chap. v. 39: (Jel:) and in the
same book, iv. 73. (Bd.) You say also,
نَفَرُوا لَهُمْ They went forth to fight them. (TA,
from a trad.) And تَفَرُوا إِلى الحَرْب They
hastened to the war, or to war. (Msb.) ―
-b10-
[Hence,] نَفَوُا مَعَهُ; and ↓ أَنْفَرُوهُ, (M, K,) inf. n.
إِنْفَارٌ; (TA;) They aided and succoured them:
(M, K:) or the former verb, alone, they, being

Msb;) He made (wild animals, T. Msb, or an
antelope. K, or a beast of carriage. M,) to take

or he made a beast of carriage to become impatient,
and to retire to a distance: (A:) or he scared
away; or made to flee, and go away, or aside,
or apart, or to a distance: (so accord. to an
explanation of the intrans. v. from which it is
derived, in the M:) you say نَفَّرْتُهُ and ↓ اِسْتَنْفَرْتُهُ
and ↓ أَنْفَرُتُهُ: and in like manner, نَفَّرَ عَنْهُ, and
أَنْفَرَ عَنْهُ, [meaning, he scared away, or made to
take fright and flee, &c., from him or it:]
(TA:) الإِنْفَارُ عَنِ الشَّىْءِ, and التَّنْفِيرُ عَنْهُ, and
الاِسْتِنْفَارُ, all signify the same, [i. e., the scaring
away, &c. from a thing.] (S.) It is said in a
trad. of Zeyneb, the daughter of Mohammad,
فَأَنْفَرَ بِهَا المُشْرِكُونَ بَعِيرَهَا حَتَّى سَقَطَتْ And
the polytheists made her camel to take fright and
run away at random with her, so that she fell.
And in like manner you say, أُنْفِرَبِنَا, and نُفِرَبِنَا,
[or نُفَّرَبِنَا Our camels were scared away with
us; or made to take fright and run away at
random with us: or] we were made to be persons
having camels taking fright and running away
at random. And تَنْفِيرٌ signifies The chiding camels or sheep or goats, and driving them from
the pasturage. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence] بَشِّروا وَلا تُنَفِّرُوا
(assumed tropical:)  [Rejoice people by what ye say. and] do not
encounter them with [roughness and violence and]
that which will incite them to نُفُور [i. e. flight or
aversion]. (TA.) See the act. part. n., below.
―

(TA.) (assumed tropical:)  Give thou to him a لَقَب [meaning a
nickname or name of reproach], (S,) or a لَقب
that is disliked: (K:) as though they held such
to be تَسْفِيرٌ لِلْجِنِّ وَالعَيْنِ عَنْهُ [a means of scaring
away the jinn, or genii, and the evil eye, from
him]. (S, K.) An Arab of the desert said,
When I was born, it was said to my father,
نَفِّرْ عَنْهُ: so he named me قُنْفُد [hedge-hog],
and surnamed me أَبو العَدّآءِ [father of the quick
runner]. (S.)

نَاْفَرَ [نَافَرَا, inf. n. مُنَافَرَةٌ, (tropical:)  They shunned or
avoided each other; regarded each other with
aversion. But perhaps this signification is only
post-classical. ―
-b2-  And hence, (tropical:)  They (two things)
were incongruous, or discordant, each with the
other. But perhaps this signification, also, is
only post-classical. See also 6.]

أَنْفَرَ see 2, in several places. ―
-b2-  أَنْفَرُوا Their
camels took fright and ran away at random,
(نَفَرَت, K, TA,) and became separated or dispersed. (TA.) ―

(T, M, K,) and ↓ نِفْرِيتٌ to عِفْرِيتٌ, (T, S, M,

i. e. these are ten men: but one does not say,
عِشْرُونَ نَفَرًا, nor more than عَشَرَة: and Abu-l-
'Abbás says, that نَفَرٌ, like قَوْمٌ and رَهْطٌ, has a
pl. signification, without any proper sing.; and
is applied to men, exclusively of women: (T:)
it is a quasi-pl. n.: (TA:) and its pl. is أَنْفَارٌ;
(M, K;) occurring in a trad., in the phrase
أَحَدٌ مِنْ أَنْفَارِنَا, which IAth explains as meaning any one of our people; syn. قَوْمِنَا: (TA:)
and ↓ نَفِيرٌ, occurring, in the accus. case, in the
Kur, xvii. 6, is, accord. to Zj, a pl. [or rather quasipl. n.] of نَفَرٌ, like عَبِيدٌ and كَلِيبٌ. (M.) [See
also نَفِيرٌ, below.] Imra-el-Keys says, describing
a man as an excellent archer,
فَهْوَ لَا تَنْمِى رَمِيَّتُهُ
مَا لَهُ لَا عُدَّ مِنْ نَفَرِهْ
(S,) And he is such that the animal shot by him
does not go away after it has been shot and then
die. What aileth him? May he be killed, so as
not to be numbered among his people. The latter
hemistich is a proverb. (Meyd.) The poet here
utters an imprecation against the man, but in so
doing praises him; as when you say, of a man
whose action pleases you, مَا لَهُ قَاتَلَهُ اللّٰهُ and
أَخْزَاهُ اللّٰهُ [q. v.]. (S.) The rel. n. is ↓ نَفَرِىٌّ.

the pl. of each is أَنْفَارٌ: (M:) or the first, (S,)
or all, (K,) a people, (S,) or company, (K,)

(S, TA.) نَفِيرُ قُرَيْشٍ means Those of Kureysh
who went forth to Bedr to defend the caravan of
Aboo-Sufyán, (M,) which was coming from
Syria. (T.) Hence the proverb, فُلَانٌ لَا فِى
العِيرِ وَلَا فِى النَّفِيرِ [Such a one is neither in
the caravan nor in the company going forth to
fight]: applied to him who is not regarded as
fit for a difficult undertaking: because none held
back from the caravan and the fight except him
who was crippled by disease and him in whom
was no good; (TA:) or the original words of
the proverb are لا فِى العِيرِ وَلَا فِى النَّفِيرِ: and
these words were first said by Aboo-Sufyán,
with reference to the Benoo-Zuhrah, when he
found them turning back towards Mekkeh; and,
accord. to As, are applied to a man who is held
in low and little repute. (Mgh.) [See also Freytag's Arab. Prov., ii. 500.]

دَابَّةٌ نَافِرٌ, and ↓ نَفُورٌ, [A beast that takes fright
and runs away at random: &c.:] (M, K:)
accord. to IAar, one should not say نَافِرَةٌ (M)
