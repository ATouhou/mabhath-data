نوس1
نَاسَ, aor. يَنُوسُ, (S, M, A, Msb,) inf. n.
نَوْسٌ (S, M, A, K) and نَوَسَانٌ, (M, A, K,) It
(a thing, S, M, as a look of hair, and an carring, A) moved to and fro; (S, A, K;) it was
in a state of commotion, and moved to and fro,
(M, TA,) hanging down; (TA;) it dangled, or
hung down and was in a state of commotion or
agitation. (M, Msb [but in the M, the verb in
this last sense has only the former of the two inf.
ns. assigned to it, though the other equally helongs to it.]) You say also, نَاسَ لُعَابُهُ His
slaver flowed and was in a state of commotion.
(M.) [See also 5]
4
اناسهُ He made it to move to and fro; (S,
A;) he made it to be in a state of commotion. (M,
K, TA,) and to move to and fro, (M,) and to
hang down; (TA;) he made it to dangle, or to
hang down and be in a state of commotion or agitation. (M.) It is said in a trad. (S, M. TA.)
of Umm-Zara, (S, TA,) أَنَاسَ مِنْ حُلِىٍّ أُذُنَىَّ [He
made my two ears to move to and fro, &c., with
ornaments]; (S, M, TA;) meaning, that he
ornamented her two ears with [ear-rings of the
kinds called] قِرَطَة and شُنُوف, which moved to
and fro, &c., in them. (TA.)
5
تنوّس It, (a branch of a tree,) being blown
by the wind, became shaken thereby, so that it
moved much to and fro; as also تنوّع (TA.)
[See also 1.]
نَاسٌ is applied to Men, and to jinn, or genii;
(S, Msb, K;) but its predominant application is
to the former: (Msb:) it is said by some to be
applied to both in the former of the last two
verses of the Kur, الَّذِى يُوَسْوِسُ فِى صُدُورِ النَّاسِ
مِنَ الجِنَّةِ وَالنَّاسِ [who suggesteth what is vain in
the breasts of people of the jinn and mankind];
unless by it be meant النَّاسِى [the forgetting]; or
من الجنّة والناس is added in explanation of a
preceding word, الوَسْوَاس, or of الذى, or it is in
dependence upon يوسوس; (Bd;) [but what corroborates the first explanation is the fact that]
men and jinn are both termed رِجَال in the Kur,
lxxii. 6; and the Arabs used to say, رَأَيْتُ نَاسًا
مِنَ الجِنِّ [I saw people of the jinn]: (Msb:) it
is a pl. of إِنْسٌ, (K,) originally أُنَاسٌ, (S, K,) a
pl. which is rare [as to form]; (K;) or أُنَاسٌ is
pl. of إِنْسَانٌ; (M, art. أنس;) and ناس has the
article ال prefixed to it, (S, M,) but not as a
substitute for the suppressed ء, because, were it so,
it would not be found prefixed to the original,
أُنَاسٌ, whereas it is found prefixed to this latter:
(S:) this derivation, however, from أُنَاسٌ, contradicts its belonging to art. نوس: (MF;) [but
some hold that it does belong to this art.; and
the form of its dim., to be mentioned below,
favours their opinion: Fei says,] it is a noun
applied to denote a pl., like قَوْمٌ and رَهْطٌ; and its
sing. is إِنْسَانٌ, from a different root: it is derived
from نَاسَ, aor. يَنُوسُ, signifying “ it hung
down and was in a state of commotion: ” and
[agreeably with this derivation it is said that] its
dim. is نُوَيْسٌ: (Msb:) some, again, said that
النَّاسُ is originally النَّاسِى. (L, TA, voce إِنْسٌ.)
See also إِنْسٌ, throughout.
-A2-  See also نُوَاسٌ.
[
نَاسُوتٌ Human nature; humanity; as also
إِنْسَِانيَّةٌ: probably post-classical: opposed to
لَاهُوتٌ, q. v., in art. ليه.]

نُوَاسٌ A [lock of hair such as is called] ذُؤَابَة,
that moves to and fro: (K, in explanation of
ذُو نُوَاسٍ the name of a king of El-Yemen:) or
↓ نُوَاسَةٌ has this signification: (A:) [the former,
therefore, is a coll. gen. n., and this is indicated
in the S; and the latter is its n. un.:] and
↓ نَوَسَاتٌ signifies i. q. ذَوَائِبُ, [pl. of ذُؤَابَةٌ,]
because they move about much. (TA.) ―
-b2-  What
hangs to the roof, (M, A, &c. [a signification
assigned in the K to نَاسٌ, probably through the
careless omission of the word النُّوَاسُ by an early
transcriber,] consisting of smoke, (A, TA,) [or
soot,] &c. (TA,) The word in the T and O, as
well as in the A [and M], is نُوَاسٌ. (TA.) ―

نَاوُوسٌ, (M, Msb,) or نَاؤُوسٌ, (Mgh,) Burialplaces of Christians: (M:) or a burial-place of
Christians: (Mgh, Msb:) [De Sacy observes,
that En-Nuweyree and El-Makreezee constantly
use this word in speaking of the burial-places
of the ancient kings of Egypt, and that it is from
the Greek
ναο�: (“ Relation de l'Égypte par
Abd-allatif; ” p. 508:) Freytag, on the authority
of Meyd., explains it as signifying a coffin in
which a corpse is enclosed: and 'Abd-el-Lateef
applies the (expression نَاوُوسٌ مِنْ حَجَرٍ to the
sarcophagus in the Great Pyramid: (see “ Abdollatiphi Hist. Æg. Comp.; ” p. 96:)] if Arabic,
(M,) of the measure فَاعُولٌ: (M, Mgh, Msb:)
pl. نَوَاوِيسُ. (Mgh, TA.)
