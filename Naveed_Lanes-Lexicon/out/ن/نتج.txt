نتج1
نَتَجَ, (S, K, &c.,) aor.
نَتُجَ, (as in the L, [but
I believe this to be a mistake,]) or
نَتِجَ, (accord. to
the Msb, MS, MF,) inf. n. نَتْجٌ; (S;) and ↓ انتج;
(A;) He assisted a she-camel, (S, K, &c.,) [and
a mare, see نُتِجَتْ,] and a ewe or she-goat (Msb)
[or other quadruped], in bringing forth; delivered
her of her young one; acting to her as a midwife
does to a woman. (T, Msb, &c.) The original
form of expression is نَتَجَهَا وَلَدًا He assisted her
in bringing forth a young one; delivered her of a
young one. (Msb.) El-Kumeyt has used the
form ↓ اِنْتَتَجَ in the sense of نَتَجَ: but it is not
commonly current in Arabic. (TA.) AHn
mentions the saying النَّاسُ ↓ إِذَا نَآءَتِ الجَبْهَةُ نَتَّجُ
وَوَلَّدُوا وَاجْتُنِىَ أَوَّلُ الكَمْأَةِ [When El-Jebhah (the
tenth of the Mansions of the Moon) sets antiheliacally, (for the setting, not the rising, is here
meant, and this it did, about the commencement
of the era of the Flight, in central Arabia, on the
11th of February,) the people assist their beasts,
much, or frequently, in bringing forth, and deliver
them, and the first of the truffles are gathered].
Thus he relates the saying, with teshdeed to the
ث of نتج, to denote frequency of the act. (L.)
―
-b2-  نُتِجَتْ, pass. in form, [but neut. in signification,] inf. n. نِتَاجٌ (S, K, &c.) and تَنْجٌ; (TA;)
and ↓ أُنْتِجَتْ, (K,) also pass. in form; and some
say نَتَجَتْ, but this is rare, and not heard by
IAar; (TA;) and some, also, say ↓ أَنْتَجَتْ,
(Lth, Kr,) but Az holds this to be a mistake;
(TA;) She (a camel, IAar, S, K, &c., and a
mare, IAar, and a sheep or goat or other
quadruped, Msb) brought forth: (T, Msb, TA:)
or one does not say نُتِجَتِ الشَّاةُ unless a man
assist at the bringing forth. (Lth.) Thus one
suppresses the objective complement of the verb.
And one also says تُنِجَتِ النَّاقَةُ وَلَدًا The she-camel
brought forth a young one: and in like manner
one says of a ewe or a she-goat: and sometimes,
with the same meaning, نَتَجَتِ الناقة ولدا, in the
act. form. (Msb.) One also says الإِبِلُ ↓ تَنَاتَجَتِ
The camels brought forth. (A.) [You say,]
نَتَجَ القَوْمُ, (Lth,) and ↓ أَنْتَجَ, (L,) The people's
camels or sheep or goats brought forth: (Lth, L:)
or ↓ أَنْتَجُوا they had pregnant camels bringing
forth. (K.) One may also say نُتِجَ الوَلَدُ,
meaning The young one of a she-camel &c., [see
نُتِجَتْ, above,] was brought forth, or born. (Msb.)

أَنْتَجَتْ She (a camel, S, and a mare, S, K,
or other solid-hoofed animal, Msb,) became pregnant: (T:) and so ↓ نَتَجَتْ, said of a she-camel,
(Msb,) or other beast; but this is rare: (EsSarakustee, Msb:) or attained to the time of
bringing forth: (S, K:) or became evidently
pregnant: (Yaakoob, S, Msb:) accord. to IAar,
أُنْتِجَتْ, in the pass. form, signifies she (a mare,
and a camel,) became near to the time of bringing
forth; and he had not heard أَنْتَجَتْ, in the act.
