نَارٌ a word of which the meaning is well

originally نُوَيْرَةٌ: (S, TA:) it is fem.: (S, M, Msb:)
and sometimes masc.: (AHn, M, K:) and the
dim. is أَنْوَارٌ, with و because it is the original
medial radical, (S,) and with ة because نار is
fem.: (Msb:) pl. [of pauc.] أَنْوُرٌ, (S, M, L,)
in the K أَنْوَارٌ, [which is a mistake, though this
is also said to be a pl. of نار,] (TA,) and [of
mult.] نِيرَانٌ [which is the most common form]
(S, M, K) and نُورٌ (AAF, S, M, Msb, K) and
نِيَرَةٌ and نِيَارٌ, (M, K,) and أَنْيَارٌ also occurs, in
the phrase نَارُ الأَنْيَارِ, in a trad. respecting the
prison of hell; this phrase, if correctly related,
perhaps meaning نَارُ النِّيِرَانِ, and انيار being
originally أَنْوَار. (IAth.) النَّارُ is also applied
to The fire of hell. (TA:) The Arabs say,
in cursing their enemies, أَبْعَدَ اللّٰهُ دَارَهُمْ وَأَوْقَدَ
نَارًا أَثَرَهُمْ [May God make their abode distant,
and kindle a fire after them!] And it was a
custom of Arab women, as related by IAar, on
the authority of El-'Okeyleeyeh, when they
feared evil from a man, and he removed from
them, to kindle a fire behind him, with the view
of causing his evil to depart with him. (T.) ―
-b2-
نَارُ الْمُهَوِّلِ A fire which the Arabs used to kindle,
in the time of ignorance, on the occasion of
entering into a confederacy: they threw into it
some salt, which crackled (يُفَقِّعُ) when the fire
burned it: with this they frightened [one another] in confirmation of the swearing. (T.) ―

نَارُ الحُبَاحِبِ has been explained in art. حب. ―
-b4-
نَارٌ also signifies simply Heat. (TA.) ―
-b5-  Also,
(tropical:)  [The fire, meaning] the evil, and excitement,
or rage, or war; as also ↓ نَائِرَةٌ. (TA.) You
say, أَوْقَدَ نَارَ الحَرْبِ (tropical:)  [He kindled the fire of
war]. (A.) ―
-b6-  Also, (tropical:)  Opinion; counsel; advice.
(IAar, T, K.) So in the trad., لَا تَسْتَضِيؤُوا بِنَارِ
المُشْرِكِينَ, (T,) or بنار أَهْلِ الشِّرْكِ, (K,) (tropical:)  [Seek
ye not to enlighten yourselves by the counsel of
the polytheists; i. e.,] seek ye not counsel of the
polytheists. (IAar, T, A. *) ―
-b7-  Also, (tropical:)  Any
brand, or mark, made with a hot iron, upon a
camel; (As, T, S, M, A, K;) as also ↓ نُورَةٌ
(M, K) and ↓ نُورٌ: (TA:) pl. as above: (M:)
or the pl. is نِيَارٌ, and the pl. of the نار that
burns is نِيرَانٌ. (IAar, Th, T.) The Arabs
say, مَا نَارُ هٰذِهِ النَّاقَةِ (tropical:)  What is the brand, or
mark, of this she-camel, with which she is burned?
(T, S, A. *) And they say, in a proverb,
بِجَارُهَا نَارُهَا (T, S) Their origin is indicated by
their mark with which they are burned. (T.)
The Rájiz says,
حَتَّى سَقَوْا آبَالَهُمْ بِالنَّارِ
وَالنَّارُ قَدْ تَشْفِى مِنَ الأُوَارِ
[Until, or so that, they watered their camels
because of the brand that they bore: for the
fire, or the brand, sometimes cures of the heat
of thirst]: (T, S: *) he means, that, when
they saw their marks with which they were
burned, they left the water to them. (S. For
another reading of this verse, see بِ.) See
also نَجْرٌ.
نَوْرٌ Blossoms, or flowers, (M, Msb, K,) of a
tree, and of a plant: (Msb:) or white blossoms
or flowers; the yellow being called زَهْرٌ; (M, K;)
for they become white, and then become yellow:
(M:) and ↓ نَوْرَةٌ and ↓ نُوَّارٌ signify the same as
نَوْرٌ: (M, K:) or [rather] نَوْرٌ and نُوَّارٌ signify
the same; (S, Msb;) [but the former is often
used as a generic n., signifying a kind of blossom
or flower: though both are coll. gen. ns.;] and
نَوْرَةٌ is the n. un. of نَوْرٌ, like as تَمْرَةٌ is of تَمْرٌ;
(Msb;) and نُوَّارَةٌ is the n. un. of نُوَّارٌ: (S, M,
L:) and the pl. of نَوْرٌ is أَنْوَارٌ. (M, Msb, K.)
نُورٌ Light; syn. ضِيَآءٌ, (S,) or ضَوْءٌ; (M, A,
Msb, K;) whatever it be; (M, A, K;) contr.
of ظُلْمَةٌ: (Msb:) or the rays thereof: (M, A,
K:) accord to Z, ضِيَآءٌ [with which ضَوْءٌ is syn.]
is more intense than نُورٌ: in the Kur, x. 5, the
sun is termed ضياء, and the moon نور: and it is
said that ضياء is essential, but نور is accidental
[light]: (TA:) it is of two kinds, the light of
the present world and that of the world to come;
and the former is either perceived sensibly, by
the eye, and this is what diffuses itself from
luminous bodies, as the sun and moon and stars,
and is mentioned in the Kur, 10. 5, referred to
above; or perceived by the eye of the intellect,
and this is what diffuses itself of the divine
lights, as the light of reason and the light of the
Kur-án; of which divine light mention is made
in the Kur, 5., former part of verse 15, and
24., latter part of verse 35; and both of these in
common are spoken of in the Kur, 6. 1 and
39. 69: that of the world to come is mentioned in the Kur in lvii. 12 [and lxvi. 8]:
(B:) the pl. is أَنْوَارٌ (S, M, Msb, K) and نِيرَانٌ;
(M, K;) the latter mentioned by Th: (M:)
and ↓ نَوْرَانيَّةٌ signifies the same as نُورٌ. (TA.)
As نور is a convenience of the pious in the
present world and the world to come, it is said
in the Kur, [lvii. 13,] اُنْظُرُونَا نَقْتَبِسْ مِنْ نُورِكُمْ
[Wait ye for us that we may take of your light].
(B.) [See also ظُلَمْةٌ.] ―
-b2-  It is also applied to
Mohammad: (T, M, K:) it is said by Aboo-Is-hak to be so applied in the Kur, v. 18. (T.)
―
-b3-  And That which manifests things, (K, TA,)
and shows to the eyes their true or real state:
and therefore النُّور is applied in the Kur, vii.
156, to (tropical:)  that [revelation] which the Prophet
brought. (TA.) ―
-b4-  النُّورُ is also one of the
names of God; meaning, accord. to IAth, He
by whose light the obscure in perception sees, and
by whose guidance the erring is directed aright:
or the Manifest, by whom is every manifestation.
And أَللّٰهُ نُورُ السَّمٰوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ [in the Kur,
xxiv. 35,] means God is the enlightener of the
heavens and of the earth: like as فُلَانٌ غِيَاثُنَا
means مُغِيثُنَا: (TA:) or, as some say, the right
director of the inhabitants of the heavens and of
the inhabitants of the earth. (T.) ―
-b5-  See also

نَوْرَةٌ: see نَوْرٌ.
نُورَةٌ: see نَارٌ, last signification.
-A2-  I. q. هِنَآءٌ
[a word well known to mean Tar, or liquid
pitch, or a kind thereof; but I do not know this
signification as applying to نُورَةٌ, nor, app., did
SM, for he has made it to be the same with
that which here next follows, from the T].
(M, K:) or a kind of stone burned and made
into كِلْس [or quick-lime] and used as a depilatory for the pubes: (T:) or lime-stone; syn.
حَجَرُ الكِلْسِ: and by a secondary and predominant application, a mixture of quick lime
(كلس) with arsenic, or orpiment, (زِرْنِيخ,) and
other things, used for removing hair: (Msb:)
[a depilatory composed of quick lime with a
small proportion (about an eighth part) of orpiment: it is made into a paste with water, before
application; and loosens the hair in about two
minutes; after which it is immediately washed
off: thus made in the present day:] some say
that it is an Arabic word; and others, that it is
arabicized. (Msb) See 8.

as also ↓ مُنِيرٌ and ↓ أَنْوَرُ: (TA:) or the last
signifies [simply] beautiful; (K;) or conspicuous
and beautiful. (TA.) It is said of Mohammad.

bright in the colour [of what was unclad] of his
body. (TA.)
نَوُورٌ, (S, Msb, and so in some copies of the
K,) or نَؤُورٌ, (T, M, and so in some copies of the
K,) or both, the former being the original form,
(S, TA,) i. q. نِيلَجٌ [i. e. Indigo-pigment]; (S, K;)
or نِيلَنْجٌ; [which appears from what follows to
be the right reading, though both نيلج and
نيلنج are used in the present day for the purpose
described in explanations of نوور, to give a
greenish colour to the marks made in tatooing;]
(Msb;) i. e., (so accord. to the S and Msb; but
in the K, and) the smoke [meaning the smokeblack] of fat, (IAar, T, S, M, Msb, K,) that
adheres to the طَسْت, (IAar, T,) with which the
punctures made in tatooing are dressed, (S, Msb,)
or filled in, (M,) that they may become green;
(S, Msb;) or with which the women of the Arabs
of the time of ignorance tattooed themselves:
(T:) i. q. غُنْجٌ [q v.]; (IAar, T:) or, accord. to
to Lth, the smoke [or smoke-black] of the wick,
used as a collyrium or for tatooing; but, [says
Az,] I have not heard that the women of the
Arabs used this as a collyrium in the time of
ignorance nor in the time of El-Islám; their using
it for tatooing, however, is mentioned in their
poems: (T:) or lamp-black; the black pigment
(نِقْس) prepared from the smoke of the lamp;
used for tattooing. (Comm. on the Mo'allakát,
printed at Calcutta, p. 143.) ―
-b2-  Also, A kind of
small stone, resembling إِثْمِد, which is bruised, or
brayed, and then taken up, like as medicine is by
the lip. (M.) [The same is found in the K,
excepting that, in this latter lexicon, the explanation is less full, and اللِّثَةُ is substituted for
الشَّفَةُ, the reading in the M.

نَائِرٌ: see نَيِّرٌ. ―
