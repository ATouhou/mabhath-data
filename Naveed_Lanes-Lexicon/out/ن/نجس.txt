نجس1
نَجِسَ, aor.
نَجَسَ; (S, Msb, K;) and نَجَسَ,
aor.
نَجُسَ; (Msb;) and نَجُسَ, aor.
نَجُسَ, (K,) accord.
to some, but the books of good repute are silent
respecting this last; (Msb;) inf. n. نَجَسٌ, (S,
Msb, TA,) of the first; (Msb;) and نَجَاسَةٌ,
(TA,) or this last is a simple subst. [as the verb
نَجُسَ to which by rule it should belong is not of
good authority]; (Msb;) It was, or became,
unclean, dirty, filthy, or impure; (Msb;) [i. e.,]
contr. of طَهَرَ, or طَهُرَ: (Msb, K: *) نَجَاسَة is of
two kinds; one kind is perceived by sense; and
one kind is perceived by the mind; of which
latter kind is that which is attributed, in the
Kur, ix. 28, to those who assert God to have
associates: (Er-Rághib, B:) but in this latter
sense, it is said by Z, to be tropical. (TA.) [See also
نَجَاسَةٌ below.] You also say, (of a garment,
A, Msb,) ↓ تنجّس, meaning, It was, or became,
rendered unclean, dirty, filthy, or impure. (A,
Msb, K.)
-A2-  نَجْسٌ, [app. an inf. n. of which
the verb is نَجَسَ,] The making a child's عُودَة
[or amulet, of any of the kinds described below,
voce تَنْجِيسٌ]. (TA.)
2
نجّسهُ, (S, A, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَنْجِيسٌ,
(TA,) He rendered him, or it, unclean, dirty,
filthy, or impure; (A, Msb, K;) and ↓ انجسهُ
signifies the same. (S, A, K.) El-Hasan said
of a man who married a woman with whom he
had committed fornication, فَهُوَ أَحَقُّ بِهَا ↓ هُوَ أَنْجَسَهَا
[He defiled her, therefore he is most worthy of
her]. (A, TA. *) ―
-b2-  نَجَّسَتْهُ الذُّنُوبُ (tropical:)  [Sins, or
crimes, defiled him]. (A, TA.)
-A2-  نجّس لَهُ, and
نجّسهُ, He charmed him; or fortified him by a
charm or an amulet [of any of the kinds described
below, voce تَنْجِيسٌ, q. v.]; syn. عَوَّذَهُ. (TA.)

أَنْجَسَ see 2, in two places.
5
تنجّس: see نَجِسَ.
-A2-  He did a deed whereby to become free from uncleanness, dirt, filth, or
impurity; (K;) like as you say تَأَثَّمَ and تَحَرَّجَ
and تَحَنَّثَ, meaning, he did a deed whereby to
become free from crime, sin, &c. (TA.)
نَجْسٌ: see نَجِسٌ.
نِجْسٌ: see نَجِسٌ.
نَجَسٌ: see نَجِسٌ.
نَجُسٌ: see نَجِسٌ.
نَجِسٌ and ↓ نَجَسٌ (S, A, O, Msb, K) and
↓ نَجُسٌ and ↓ نَجْسٌ and ↓ نِجْسٌ (A, O, K) Unclean, dirty, filthy, or impure: (A, Msb, K:)
the last of these is only used when the word is
preceded or followed by رِجْسٌ: (ISd:) or only
when it is preceded by رِجْسٌ: (Fr, S, * and Har
in the Durrat-el-Ghowwás:) but this remark
correctly applies only to the greater number of
instances: (M, F:) the second of the above five
forms is an inf. n. used as an epithet; (A, Msb;)
and is [therefore] used as sing. and dual. and pl.
and masc. and fem., without variation: (TA:)
[and the first and last are also used as pls., as
will be seen below; but when so used, I suppose
قَوْمٌ or some other coll. gen. n. to be understood:]
the pl. [of every one of the other forms] is أَنْجَاسٌ
(A, Msb, TA) and [of the fourth and fifth, and
perhaps of the first and third also, though I do
not remember similar instances,] نِجْسَةٌ. (TA.)
[See also نَجَاسَةٌ, below.] نَجِسٌ and ↓ نَجْسٌ
[&c.], applied to a man, signify Unclean, &c.,
[both properly and tropically]. (TA.) [The
two following examples are said in the A to be
tropical.] النَّاسُ أَجْنَاسٌ وَأَكْثَرُهُمْ أَنْجَاسٌ (tropical:)  [Men
are of several kinds, and most of them are unclean.]
(A, TA.) And إِنَّمَا الْمُشْرِكُونَ نَجَسٌ (tropical:)  [Verily
the associaters of others with God are but unclean],
said in the Kur, [ix. 28,] (S, A, TA,) or نَجِسٌ,
or ↓ نِجْسٌ, accord. to certain readers. (TA.)
-A2-
Also, all the above forms, A man having an incurable disease. (TA.) ―
-b2-  See also نَاجِسٌ.
نُجُسٌ: see مُنَجِّسٌ.

نَجَاسَةٌ: see 1: Uncleanness, dirtiness, filthiness,
or impurity. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  In the conventional
language of the law, A particular uncleanness, of
such a kind as renders prayer invalid; as urine,

دَآءٌ نَاجِسٌ and ↓ نَجِيسٌ (S, A, K) and ↓ نَجِسٌ
(TA) An incurable disease: (S, K, TA:) or a
disease that baffles the مُنَجِّسُون. (A.) See

أَنْجَسُ [More, and most, unclean, dirty, filthy,
or impure]. You say, لَا تَرَى أَنْجَسَ مِنَ الكَافِرِ
(tropical:)  [Thou wilt not see any one more unclean than the
unbeliever]. (A, TA.)
تَنْجِيسٌ The name of a thing, either something
unclean, or bones of the dead, or a menstruous
rag, which used to be hung upon him for whom
there was a fear of the jinn's, or genii's, being
attached to him: (K:) or the hanging of some
such thing upon such a person, as a child or any
other; for they used to say that the jinn would
not approach those things: (TA:) or a thing
which the Arabs used to do, as an amulet, to drive
away thereby the [evil] eye: (S:) ↓ مُنَجِّسَةٌ also
is the name of a kind of amulet: (IAar:) and
↓ نِجَاسٌ is syn. with تَعْوِيذٌ; [by which may be
meant either that it signifies an amulet, or that it
is a quasi-inf. n. of 2; for it is said that] it is
app. a subst. from نَجَّسَ لَهُ, or نَجَّسَهُ, as signifying
عَوَّذَهُ. (IAar.) See also 2.
مُنَجِّسٌ One who hangs, upon him for whom
there is fear, unclean things, such as bones of the
dead, and the like, to drive away the jinn, or
genii; because these beings shun such things; (S, *
A, TA;) one who fortifies by charms or amulets
[of the kinds above mentioned]; syn, مُعَوِّذٌ: (K:)
pl. مُنَجِّسُونَ: (A:) and ↓ نُجُسٌ [a pl. of which
the sing. is not mentioned] is syn. with مُعَوِّذُونَ.
