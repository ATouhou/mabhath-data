pierced himself therewith]: the [former] ب is
put in the place of عَنْ: he says, do not thou
extract from the foot of another a thorn and
put it in thy foot ?? (TA:) or مَنْ شَاكَهَا means
who has entered among the thorns. (S and O, in

K) and نِقَاشٌ, (M, TA,) He did the utmost with
him, or went to the utmost length with him, in
reckoning, (S, M, Msb, K,) so as to omit nothing
therein: (A 'Obeyd:) A 'Obeyd thinks that نَقْشٌ
signifying the “ extracting ” a thorn from the foot
is from this; but others say the reverse; that
the primary signification of مُنَاقَشَةٌ is the extracting a thorn from the body with difficulty; and
that it then became [conventionally regarded as]
a proper term in the sense of doing the utmost,
