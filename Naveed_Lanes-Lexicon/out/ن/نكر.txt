نكر1
نَكِرَهُ: see 4, in several places.
-A2-  نَكُرَ, inf. n.
نَكَارَةٌ, [He was, or became, ignorant: or perhaps
only the inf. n. of the verb in this sense is used:
see نَكَارَةٌ, below. ―
-b2-  And, contr., He possessed
cunning; meaning both intelligence with craft
and forecast; and simply intelligence, or skill
and knowledge: or perhaps only the inf. n. of
the verb in this sense is used: see نَكْرٌ. ―
-b3- ] It
(a thing, or an affair,) was, or became, مُنْكَر [app.
here meaning disapproved; or bad, evil, abominable, or foul; or disallowed]. (A.) ―
-b4-  Also,
(S, K,) inf. n. نَكَارَةٌ, (TK,) or نُكْرَةٌ, (TA,) It (a
thing, or an affair,) was, or became, difficult,
hard, arduous, or severe. (S, K. *)
2
نكّرهُ, (inf. n. تَنْكِيرٌ, Msb,) He changed, or
altered, him or it, (S, A, Msb, TA,) to an
unknown state, (S, TA,) so as not to be known;
(TA;) [he disguised him or it.] It is said in
the Kur, [xxvii. 41,] نَكِّرُوا لَهَا عَرْشَهَا Alter ye her
throne so that it may not be known to her.
(TA.) See also 4, last signification but one.
―
-b2-  [In grammar, He made it (a noun) indeterminate.]
3
ناكرهُ, (S, TA,) inf. n. مُنَاكَرَةٌ, (A, K,)
He strove, or endeavoured, to outwit, deceive,
beguile, or circumvent, him; or he practised
with him mutual deceit, guile, or circumvention;
syn. خَادَعَهُ and دَاهَاهُ: the inf. n. is also explained by مُرَاوَغَةٌ as well as مُخَادَعَةٌ [both of
which signify the same]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Hence,
(TA,) He contended with him in fight; (S, K;)
and in war, or hostility. (A, K.) It is said
of Mohammad, by Aboo-Sufyán (S, TA) Ibn-
Harb, (TA,) لَمْ يُنَاكِرْ أَحَدًا إِلَّا كَانَتْ مَعَهُ
الأَهْوَالُ, (S, TA,) meaning, He did not war
with any one without being aided by terror
[cast into the hearts of his opponents]. (TA.)
And one says, بَيْنَهُمَا مُنَاكَرَةٌ Between them two
is war, or hostility, (A, TA, *) and fighting.
(TA.)
4
انكرهُ, (S, A, Msb, K, &c.,) inf. n. إِنْكَارٌ;
(Msb, &c.;) and ↓ نَكِرَهُ, (S, A, Msb, K, &c.,)
aor.
نَكَرَ, (L,) or it does not admit the variations
of tense like other verbs, (IKtt, Msb,) it is not
used in the future tense, nor in commanding nor
in forbidding, (Lth,) inf. n. نَكَرٌ (K) and نُكْرٌ and
نُكُورٌ (S, K) and نَكِيرٌ; (K;) and ↓ استنكرهُ; (S,
M, A, K;) and ↓ تناكرهُ; (M, K;) signify the
same; (S, A, Msb, K, &c.;) i. e., He ignored,
was ignorant of, did not know, failed to know, or
[rather] was unacquainted with, it (i. e. a thing,
or an affair, IKtt, K) or him (a man, S);
syn. جَهِلَهُ; (Kr, K;) or contr. of عَرَفَهُ: (S, *
IKtt, Msb:) [see also نَكَارَةٌ:] some, however,
say, the نَكِرَ has a more intensive signification
than أَنْكَرَ: and some, that نَكِرَ has for its objective
complement an object of the mind; and أَنْكَرَ, an
object of the sight: (A, TA:) or [the converse
is the case;] نَكِرَ has for its objective complement
an object of the sight; and أَنْكَرَ, an object of the
mind: (Kull, p. 81:) [but both forms seem to
have been generally used indiscriminately.] ElAashà says,
وَأَنْكَرَتْنِى وَمَا كَانَ الَّذِى نَكِرَتْ
مِنَ الحَوَادِثِ إِلَّا الشَّيْبَ وَالصَّلَعَا
[And she did not know me; and the accidents
which she did not know were none others than
hoariness, and baldness of the fore part of the
head]. (S, TA.) And it is said in the Kur,
[xi. 73,] وَأَوْجَسَ مِنْهُمْ خِيفَةٌ ↓ نَكِرَهُمْ [He knew
not what they were, and conceived a fear, or a
kind of fear, of them]: (TA:) نَكِرَهُمْ here signifies أَنْكَرَهُمْ: (Jel:) or it means أَنْكَرَ ذٰلِكَ مِنْهُمْ
[q. v. infra]. (Bd.) ―
-b2-  أَنْكَرَهُ also signifies He
denied, or disacknowledged, it; (L, art. جحد;
[and this signification, as well as the first, may
be meant to be indicated by those who say that
أَنْكَرَهُ signifies the contr. of عَرفَهُ;]) [and so ↓ نَكِرَهُ;
for] إِنْكَارٌ signifies i. q. جُحُودٌ, (S, TA,) and so
نُكْرَانٌ [which is an inf. n. of نَكِرَهُ]. (TA.) [In
this sense it is doubly trans.:] you say, أَنْكَرْتُهُ
حَقَّهُ, meaning, I denied, or disacknowledged, to
him his right. (Msb.) The cause of إِنْكَار with
the tongue is إِنْكَار with the mind, but sometimes
the tongue denies, or disacknowledges, (يُنْكِرُ,)
a thing when the image thereof is present in the
mind; and this is lying; as is the case in the
following passage of the Kur, [xvi. 85,] يَعْرِفُونَ
نِعْمَةَ اللّٰهِ ثُمَّ يُنْكِرُونَهَا [They confess, or acknowledge, the favour of God; then they deny, or disacknowledge, it]. (B.) See also نَكِيرٌ.
-A2-  Also,
He deemed it strange, extraordinary, or improbable. (MF, voce عَجَبٌ.] ―
-b2-  [Also He denied,
or negatived, it. ―
-b3-  He disbelieved it. ―
-b4-  And
He disapproved it; he disliked it; he deemed it,
or declared it to be, bad, evil, abominable, or
foul; he disallowed it: so accord. to explanations of the pass. part. n., q. v. infra; and
accord. to common usage of classical and of
modern times.] It is said of Abraham, when
the angels came to him, and he saw that their
hands did not touch the meat which be had
brought to them, نَكِرَهُمْ, meaning, أَنْكَرَ ذٰلِكَ مِنْهُمْ
[He deemed that conduct of their's evil, or disapproved it: or, perhaps, he did not know
what that conduct of their's was, or what it
indicated]: ↓ نَكِرَ and أَنْكَرَ and ↓ استنكر [of which
last see an ex. voce تَهِمَ] signify the same. (Bd,
xi. 73.) And you say, أَنْكَرْتُ عَلَيْهِ فِعْلَهُ, meaning, I blamed, or found fault with, his deed,
and forbade it; I disapproved and disallowed
his deed. (Msb:) [and I manifested, or showed,
or declared, disapproval, or disallowance, of his
deed: and in like manner, أَنْكَرْتُ عَليْهِ, elliptically; فِعْلَهُ, (his deed,) or قَوْلَهُ, (his saying;)
or the like, being understood; like عَيَّرَ عَلَيْهِ for
عَيَّرَ عَلَيْهِ فِعْلَهُ or the like: see نَكِيرٌ.] ―
-b5-  إِنْكَارٌ
also signifies The changing [a thing; like تَنْكِيرٌ]:
(T, Msb, TA:) or the changing what isمُنْكَر
[here app. meaning disapproved: see نَكِيرٌ, which
is syn. with it, but is a simple subst.]. (S, TA.)
―
-b6-  مَا أَنْكَرَهُ How great it his cunning! meaning
both his intelligence, and craft, and forecast; and
simply, his intelligence, or skill and knowledge.
(TA.) And مَا كَانَ أَنْكَرَهُ How great was his
cunning, &c. (TA.)
5
تنكّر He, or it, changed, or altered, himself,
or itself; or became changed, or altered; (S, A,
Msb, TA;) to an unknown state: (S, TA:)
[he assumed an unknown appearance: he disguised himself; or became disguised:] he became
changed or altered in countenance by anger so
that he who saw him did not know him: (Har,
p. 144:) or تَنَكُّرٌ signifies the changing, or altering oneself, or itself; or becoming changed, or
altered; from a state which pleases one to a
state which one dislikes. (T, K.) ―
-b2-  إِيَّاكَ وَالتَّنَكُّرَ
Avoid thou evil disposition. (Mgh.) ―
-b3-  تَنَكَّرَ لِى
فُلاَنٌ Such a one [became changed, or altered, in
countenance to me by anger so that I did not
know him; or] met me in a morose manner
(A, TA.) [In art. شنف in the K, تَنَكَّرَهُ occurs.]

in the latter part. ―
-b2-  اِسْتِنْكَارٌ also signifies The
inquiring respecting, or seeking to understand, a
thing, or an affair, which one disapproves; (K,
TA;) when one disapproves confirming, or establishing, the opinion expressed by an inquirer, or
disapproves that his opinion should be contrary
to what he has expressed. (TA.)
نَكْرٌ: see نُكْرٌ.
-A2-  See also نَكِرٌ.
نُكْرٌ (S, K) and ↓ نَكْرٌ [but the former is the
more common] and ↓ نَكَارَةٌ (S, A, K) and ↓ نَكْرَآءُ
(A, K) Cunning; meaning both intelligence mixed
with croft and forecast; and [simply] intelligence,
or sagacity, or skill and knowledge; syn. دَهَآءٌ;
(S, A, K;) and فِطْنَةٌ. (A, K.) See also نَكُرَ.
You say of a man who is intelligent and evil, or
cunning, مَا أَشَدَّ نُكْرَهُ, and ↓ نَكْرَهُ [How great is
his cunning, &c.!] (S.) And فَعَلَهُ مِنْ نُكْرِهِ, and
↓ نَكَارَتِهِ, He did it of his cunning, &c. (TA.)
And it is said in a trad. of Mo'áwiyeh, إِنِّى لَأَكْرَهُ
النَّكَارَةَ فِى الرَّجُلِ Verily I hate cunning (الدَّهَآءَ) in
the man. (TA.)

نَكَرٌ [app. Difficulty, hardness, arduousness, or
severity;] a subst. from نَكُرَ, in the sense of صَعُبَ
[It was difficult, &c.]. (IKtt, TA.)
نَكُرٌ: see نَكِرٌ, in two places.
نَكِرٌ and ↓ نَكُرٌ (S, K) and ↓ نُكُرٌ and ↓ مُنْكَرٌ, (K,)
epithets applied to a man, Possessing cunning; or
intelligence mixed with cunning and forecast; (S,
K;) and [simply] intelligent, or skilful and
knowing: (K:) and so, applied to a woman,
↓ نُكُرٌ (K) and ↓ نَكْرٌ (L, TA [but this is probably
a mistake for ↓ نُكُرٌ]) and ↓ نَكْرَآءُ, but أَنْكَرُ is not
applied to a man in this sense, (Az, TA,) nor is
مُنْكَرَةٌ to a woman: (TA:) pl. of the first and
second (S, K,) and third, (K,) أَنْكَارٌ: (S, K:)

denial: or disapproval, or the like]. (TK,) like

[Thou wast to me most ignorant. &c.]

And there shall be for you no [power of] denial
of your sins. (Bd, Jel.) And one says, شُتِمَ

[a thing]: (T, Msb, TA:) or the changing what
is مُنْكَر [here app. meaning disapproved]: (S,
TA:) a simple subst. (T, TA.) The words of
the Kur, [xxii. 43 and lxvii. 18,] فَكَيْفَ كَانَ نَكِيرِ
are explained as signifying And how was my
changing [of their condition]! (TA:) or the
meaning is, and how was my manifestation of
disapproval of their conduct, (إِنْكَارِى عَلَيْهِمْ,) by
changing favour into trial, and life into destruction, and a flourishing condition into a state of
ruin! (Bd, xxii. 43.) In [some of] the copies
of the K, it is said that نَكِيرَةٌ [but in a MS. copy

الحَمِيرِ [Verily the most abominable of voices is
the voice of asses]. (TA.) ―

مُنْكَرٌ contr. of مَعْرُوفٌ: (K:) [an explanation
including several significations, here following.]
―
-b2-  [Ignored, or unknown; as also ↓ مَنْكُورٌ, for
مَنْكُورٌ is syn. with مَجْهُولٌ [the pass. part. n. of
the verb by which أَنْكَرَهُ is explained by Kr and

declared, thereby, to be bad, evil, hateful, abominable, foul, unseemly, ugly, or hideous; or pronounced to be so by the law because the mind

and thus it is used in the Kur, ix. 113 [and other
places]: (B, TA:) or anything pronounced to be
bad, evil, hateful, abominable, or foul, and forbidden, and disapproved, disliked, or hated, by
the law: (TA:) a saying, or an action, unapproved, not approved, unaccepted, or not accepted,
by God: (KT:) unbecoming, indecent, or indecorous. (KL.) See مَعْرُوفٌ, voce عُرْفٌ. مُنْكَرٌ
and ↓ نُكْرٌ and ↓ نُكُرٌ (S, A, Msb, K) and ↓ نَكْرَآءُ
(S, Msb K) are all syn., (S, A, Msb, K,) [and
are used as epithets in which the quality of a
subst. predominates,] signifying a bad, an evil,
a hateful, an abominable, a foul, an unseemly, an
ugly, or a hideous, [and a formidable,] thing or
affair [or action or saying or quality, &c.]: (Msb:)
[in this sense, its pl. is مُنْكَرَاتٌ and مَنَاكِيرُ; as
will be seen below:] ↓ نُكْرٌ is contr. of عُرْفٌ [which
is syn. with مَعْرُوفٌ]. (TA.) You say فِيهِمُ
الْمَعْرُوفُ وَالْمُنْكَرُ, and العُرْفُ والنُّكْرُ, [In them are
good and evil qualities.] And هُمْ يَرْكَبُونَ الْمُنْكَرَاتِ,

hast done a bad, an evil, an abominable, or a foul,
thing]. (S.)

مَنْكُورٌ: see مُنْكَرٌ, first signification. The pl. is
مَنَاكِيرُ, [which is also a pl. of مُنْكَرٌ,] accord. to
Sb, who mentions it because, accord. to rule, the
pl. of a sing. of this class is formed by the addition of و and ن for the masc., and ا and ت for
the fem. (Abu-l-Hasan, TA.)
خَرَجَ مُتَنَكِّرًّا He went forth disguised; or
changed in outward appearance, or state of apparel. (TA.)
مُسْتَنْكَرٌ: see مُنْكَرٌ, first signification.
