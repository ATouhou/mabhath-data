نجب1
نَجَبَ الشَّجَرَةَ, aor.
نَجِبَ and
نَجُبَ, inf. n. نَجْبٌ, He
took off the bark of the stem, or trunk, of the tree:
(S:) or نَجَبَهُ, aor. and inf. n. as above; and
↓ نجّبه, inf. n. تَنْجِيبٌ; and ↓ انتجبه; He took off
its bark; barked it. (ISd, K.) See نَجَبٌ.
-A2-
نَجُبَ, aor.
نَجُبَ, inf. n. نَجَابَةٌ, He was generous,
noble, or liberal, &c.: [see نَجِيبٌ]. (Msb, K.)
He, or it, was excellent, or choice. (MA.)
[Said of a horse and the like, He was generous,
excellent, strong, light, or swift.] ―
-b2-  نَاجَبَهُ فَنَجَبَهُ:
see 3.
2
نَجَّبَ see 1.
3
نَاْجَبَ ↓ نَاجَبَهُ فَنَجَبَهُ [He vied with him, or strove
to surpass him, in generosity, nobleness, or liberality; and he surpassed him therein.] (TA,
art. خير.)
4
انجب He begot a generous, noble, or liberal,
child; such as is termed نَجِيبٌ. (S.) [This
verb, being coupled in the K with نَجُبَ, might
be imagined syn. therewith; but this, accord. to
the TA, is not the case.] El-Aashà says,
أَنْجَبَ أَزْمَانَ وَالِدَاهُ بِهِ
إِذْ نَجَلَاهُ فَنِعْمَ مَا نَجَلَا
(S) He begot a generous son in the times when his
parents (rejoiced) in him, when they produced him;
and excellent was that which they produced.
Accord. to one reading, the second word is أَيَّامَ:
and أَيَّامُ وَالِدَيْهِ is also read in place of ازمان والداه;
in which case, ايَّام is fig. the agent of انجب.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  انجبت is said of a woman, in the same
sense. (TA.) See also انخب. ―
-b3-  انجب [as
also انخب] He begot a cowardly child: (from
نَجَبٌ, the “ bark ” of a tree: TA:) thus the
verb bears two contr. significations: (K:) or the
two significations are not necessarily contr.; for
a courageous man may be not generous, or liberal;
and a generous, or liberal, man may be not
courageous. (MF.)
8
انتجبهُ He selected him; chose him; (S;)
preferred him above others. (TA.) See also
انتخب. ―
-b2-  See 1. ―
-b3-  ذَهَبَ يَنْتَجِبُ He went to
collect [the kind of bark called] نَجَبٌ. (TA.) ―
-b4-
A poet says,
يَا أَيُّهَا الزَّاعِمُ أَنِّى أَجْتَلِبْ
وَأَنَّنِى غَيْرَ عِضَاهِى أَنْتَجِبْ
meaning, O thou who assertest that I take the
verses of other poets and appropriate them to
myself, and, and as it were, take the bark of other
trees than my own 'idáh, to tan therewith...
(TA.) [See عِضَاهُ.]
نَجْبٌ: see نَجِيبٌ.
نَجَبٌ The bark (لِحَآء) of trees: (S, K:) or the
rind of the roots thereof: or of what is hard
thereof. (K.) The soft peel of branches is not
thus called; nor is the rind of roots called قِشْر,
but نجب: n. un. نَجَبَةٌ. (TA.)
نَجْبَةُ نَمْلَةٍ A bite of an ant. So in a trad.,
accord. to one reading: accord. to another reading,
it is نَخْبَة. Both these words are given by IAth
on the authority of Z. (TA.)
نُجَبَةٌ and نَجَبَةٌ: see نَجِيبٌ.
نَجِيبٌ A generous, noble, liberal, man; (S, K;)

who is like his father in generosity and actions:
(TA:) as also ↓ نَجْبٌ (K) [explained as signifying “ liberal, generous ”] and ↓ نُجَبَةٌ: (S, K:)
or you call a man نجيب when he is generous,
noble, or liberal; but when he is unequalled
among his people in generosity, &c., you say
قَوْمِهِ ↓ هُوَ نَجَبَةُ, in measure like حَلَمَة: (El-'Alam
Es-Sakháwee:) [but MF doubts the correctness of this measure; and seems to think that the
correct word is ↓ نُجَبَة:] القَوْمِ ↓ هو نُجَبَةُ is said
of a man when he is the man, among them, who
is distinguished by generosity, &c.: (S:) pl.
نُجَبَآءُ and أَنْجَابٌ and نُجُبٌ. (K.) ―

مِفْعَلٌ, which is not used in the sense of the
measure مَفْعُولٌ. (TA.)
مُنْتَجَبٌ Select; chosen; choice: (K:) an epithet applied to anything. (TA.)
