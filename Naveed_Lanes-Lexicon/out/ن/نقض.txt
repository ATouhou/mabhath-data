نقض1
نَقَضَهُ, (M, Mgh, Msb,) aor.
نَقُضَ, (M, Msb,
TA,) inf. n. نَقْضٌ, (S, M, A, Mgh, Msb, K,)
He undid it; took it; or pulled it, to pieces:
untwisted it: unravelled it: unwove it: dissolved
it: broke it: or rendered it uncompact, unsound,
or unfirm,: after having made it compact, sound,
or firm: (JK, M, A, Msb, K, TA:) namely
a building, or structure: and a rope, or cord:
(S, A, Mgh, Msb, K, TA:) and silk, or flax:
(TA:) and cloth: (L:) and (tropical:)  a compact, contract, or covenant; (S, A, Msb, K, TA;) and
(assumed tropical:) a sale: (Mgh:) and (assumed tropical:)  other things; (A, K,
TA;) such as (assumed tropical:)  an affair, or a case; and (assumed tropical:)  the
state of a place through which the invasion of
an enemy is feared: (TA:) contr. of أَبْرَمَهُ, (M,
A, K, TA,) as relating to a building or structure,
and to a rope or cord, (A, K, TA,) and to a
compact or contract or covenant, &c.: (K, TA:)
or i. q. حَلَّ بَرْمَهُ, as relating to a rope or
cord, and to a compact or contract or covenant:
(Msb:) or i. q. هَدَمَهُ, as relating to a building
or structure: (TA:) or the inf. n. signifies إِفْسَادُ
مَا أَبْرَمْتَ, as relating to a building or structure.
(JK, TA,) and to a rope or cord, (JK,) and to
a compact or contract or covenant. (TA.) [It
is said in the K, that النَّقْضُ is the contr. of
الإِبْرَامُ, like الإِنْتقَاضُ and التَّنَاقُضُ: but this is
a glaring mistake; and seems to be a corruption
of the following passage in the M: النَّقْضُ ضِدُّ
الإِبْرَامِ نَقَضَهُ يَنْقُضُهُ نَقْضًا وَانْتَقَضَ وَتَنَاقَضَ, which
is meant indicate that انتقض and تناقض are
quasi-passives of نَقَضَهُ: and in like manner, the
passage in the A, النَّقْضُ فِى البِنَآءِ وَالحَبْلِ وَغَيْرِهِ
ضِدُّ الإِبْرَامِ وَانْتَقَضَ وَنَتَقَّضَ, indicates that انتقض
and تنقّض are quasi-passives of نَقَضَهُ. Further.
it should be observed that نَقَضَهُ, as relating to
a building, is not well explained by هَدَمَهُ; for
you say, نَقَضَ البِنَآءَ مِنْ غَيْرِ هَدْمٍ, (mentioned
in the S and A, &c., in art. قوض,) meaning He
took to pieces the building without demolishing,
or destroying.] ―
-b2-  [Hence,] نَقَصَ فُلَانٌ وَتَرَهُ [lit.
Such a one undid, or untwisted, his bow-string];
meaning (tropical:)  such a one took, or had taken, his
blood-revenge. (A, TA.) And الدَّهْرُ ذُو نَقْضٍ
وَإِمْرَارٍ [lit. Time, or fortune, has a property of
untwisting and twisting tightly]; meaning (tropical:)  that
which time, or fortune, [as it were] twists tightly,
[or makes firm.] it, at another time, [as it were]
untwists, or undoes. (TA.) And نَقَضْتُ مَا أَبْرَمَهُ
(tropical:)  I annulled [what he confirmed, or made firm].
(Msb.) And يَنْقُضُ عَلَيْهِ (tropical:)  [He undoes, or annuls,
or contradicts, what he (another) has said]; said of
a poet replying to another poet. (Lth, A, K.) ―
-b3-
نقض السقف, [i. e., app., نَقْضُ السَّقْفِ,] also
signifies تحريك خشبه [i. e. تَحْرِيكُ خَشَبِهِ, The
moving, or shaking, of the pieces of wood, or
rafters, of the roof]. (TA. [But perhaps the
phrase to be explained is السَّقْفُ ↓ نَقَّضَ, and the
explanation, correctly, تَحَرَّكَ خَشَبُهُ, i. e. The
pieces of wood, or rafters, of the roof moved, or
shook, (for this, I am informed, is agreeable
with modern usage,) app. so as to produce a
sound: see also 5.])
-A2-  See also 4.

نَقَّضَ see 4, in two places: ―
-b2-  and 5; and see 1,
next before the last break.
3
المُنَاقَضَةُ فِى القَوْلِ is (tropical:)  The saying that which
is contradictory in its meaning [or meanings; as
though one of its meanings undid, or annulled,
the other]: (S, * K, TA:) from نَقْضُ البِنَآءِ: and
meaning (tropical:)  the contending with another in words,
[or in contradiction,] each rebutting what the
other said. (TA.) You say, ناقضهُ فِى الشَّىْءِ,
inf. n. مُنَاقَضَةٌ and نِقَاضٌ, (tropical:)  He contradicted him
in, or respecting, the thing. (M, TA. *) And
قُلْتُ لَهُ نِقَاضًا (tropical:)  I contradicted him with respect to
his saying, and his satirizing of me. (M, TA.)
And ناقض أَحَدُ الشَّاعِرَيْنِ الأَخَرَ (tropical:)  [One of the two
poets contradicted the other]. (A.) And ناقض
قَوْلُهُ الثَّانِى الآوَّلَ (tropical:)  [His second saying contradicted
the first]. (A, TA.) And ناقض آخِرُ قَوْلِهِ الأَوَّلَ
(tropical:)  [The last part of his saying contradicted the
first]. (Mgh.) [See also 6.]
4
انقض الكَمْأَةَ, (M, K, TA.) and انقض عَنْهَا.
(M, TA,) He removed the crust of earth from
over the truffles: (M:) or he extracted, or took
forth, the truffles from the earth. (K, TA.)
-A2-
انقض الكَمْءُ The crusts of earth ??? up (تَقَلْفَعَتْ)
from over the truffle; as also ↓ نَقَّضَ. (M, TA.)
[See also 5.] ―
-b2-  انقضت الأَرْضُ The earth showed
[or put forth] its plants, or herbage. (M, TA.)
-A3-  انقض also signifies It produced, made, gave,
emitted, or uttered, a sound, noise, voice, or cry:
(S, M, K, TA:) and [particularly] a slight sound
like what is termed نَقْرٌ: (S, TA:) said of a joint
of a man, (M, K,) and of the fingers [when their
joints are made to crack], and of the ribs, (A,)
[see also 5,] and of a camel's saddle, (A, TA.,)
and of a cupping-instrument when the cupper
sucks it, (TA,) [&c., (see نَقِيضٌ,)] and of an
eagle, (S, M, K,) and of a hen (S, A) on the
occasion of her laying eggs, (A,) and of a chicken,
(M, A, K,) and of an ostrich, and of a quail,
and of a hawk, and of a scorpion, and of a frog,
and of the [kind of lizard called] وَزَغ, and of the
وَبْر [or Syrian hyrax], (M, K,) and of a young
camel, the sounds of which are denoted by إِنْقَاضٌ
and كَتِيتٌ, as those of a camel advanced in age
are by قَرْقَرَةٌ and هَدِيرٌ: (S:) or إِنْقَاضٌ relates to
animate things; and ↓ نَقْضٌ, inf. n. of نَقضَ,
aor.
نَقُضَ and
نَقِضَ, to inanimate things. (M, K.)
[Accord. to the A, whether said of animate things
or of inanimate, it is proper, not tropical, but
accord. to what is said in the TA voce نَقِيض, it
is properly said of animate things, and tropically of
inanimate; though, if any such distinction exist,
the reverse seems to me to be more probable.] ―
-b2-
You say also, انقض بِالدَّابَّةِ, (K,) or بِالْحِمَارِ. (Lth,)
or, as As says, (M, TA,) بِالعَيْرِ, (M,) or بِالبَعِيرِ,
(TA,) and بِالفَرَسِ, (M, TA,) He made a sound
to the beast of carriage, (M, K,) or to the ass,
(Lth, As, M,) or to the camel, (As, TA,) and to
the horse, (As, M, TA,) at the two sides of his
tongue, after making it cleave to the roof of his
mouth, (Lth, M, K, TA,) without removing its
extremity from its place, (Lth, TA,) in order to
chide the beast: (L:) or انقض بِهِ signifies i. q.
نَقَرَ بِهِ [q. v.]; (As, M, A, TA;) the object being
a [camel such as is called] قَعُود; (A;) or whatever be the object. (As, M, TA.) And انقض
بِالْمَعْزِ, (S, Sgh, K,) or بِالعَنْزِ, (M, A,) He called
the goats, (S, Sgh, K,) or the she-goat; (M, A;)
accord. to AZ, (S, Sgh,) or Ks. (M, L.) And
انقض بِهِ He made a sound to him like as when
thou makest a smacking with the tongue to a sheep
or goat, [in the TA, كما تنقر الشاة, for which I
read كَمَا تَنْقُرُ بِالشَّاةِ,] deeming him ignorant.
(TA.) And He made a clapping to him with
one of his hands upon the other, so as to cause a
[sound such as is termed] نَقِيض to be heard.
(El-Khattábee.)
-A4-  انقض أَصَابِعَهُ (M, A, K) He
made a sound, or sounds, [app. a cracking of the
joints,] with his fingers: (M:) [and so ↓ نَقَّضَهَا,
inf. n. تَنْقِيضٌ: (see فَرْقَعَ:)] or he struck with his
fingers in order that they might make a sound, or
sounds: (K:) if it mean cracking of the joints
(فَرْقَعَة), it is disapproved; but if clapping, it is
not. (TA.) And انقض العِلْكَ He caused the
[kind of gum called] علك to make a sound, or
sounds; [i. e., in chewing it, as many women do;]
the doing of which is disapproved. (S, L, K.
[But in the S and L, it said that إِنْقَاضُ العِلْكَ
signifies تَصْوِيتُهُ, which does not necessarily indicate that the former verb is transitive.]) ―
-b2-
Hence, (S, M, TA,) انقض الحِمْلُ ظَهْرَهُ (S, M,
A, Msb, K *) The load made his back to sound by
reason of its weight: (M:) or pressed heavily
upon him, (S, M, Msb, K,) so that his back was
heard to make a sound such as is termed نَقِيض;
(M, K; * i. e. the sound of the camel's saddle when
it becomes infirm by reason of the weight of the
load; (Bd, xciv. 3;) or a slight sound, as when
a man makes a smacking with his tongue (يُنْقِضُ)
to his ass, in driving him: (TA:) or oppressed
his back by its weight: (Msb:) or rendered him
lean, or emaciated; جَعَلَهُ نِقْضًا, i. e. مَهْزُولًا. (Ibn-
'Arafeh, K.) Thus in the phrase الَّذِى أَنْقَضَ ظَهْرَكَ,
(S, M, K,) in [xciv. 3, of] the Kur. (S, M.)
5
تنقّض: see 8. ―
-b2-  الأَرْضُ عَنِ الكَمْأَةِ
The earth clave, or cracked, or burst, from over
the truffles; (S, A, * TA;) syn. تَفَطَّرَتْ. (S,
TA.) In all the copies of the K, we find تنقّض
الدَّمُ, explained by تَقَطَّرَ; [as though meaning
The blood was made to drop, drip, or fall in
drops;] but how likely is this to be a mistranscription. (TA.) [The right reading of the
phrase is probably تنقّض الكَمْءُ; and of the explanation, تَفَطَّرَ; and if so, the phrase is like
أَنْقَضَ الكَمْءُ, and نَقَّضَ, explained above: see 4,
second sentence.] ―
-b3-  تنقّض الَبْيتُ The house, or
chamber, became cleft, or cracked, in several
places, so as to cause a sound to be heard (K,
TA.) And تنقّض is also said of a building,
[app. in the same sense,] like ↓ نَقَّضَ. (TA.)
[See نَقَّضَ السَّقْفُ, in 1, next before the last break.]
You say also, تنقّضت عِظَامُهُ (tropical:)  His bones made a
sound [app. in being broken]. (IF, K, TA.)
[See also 4.]
6
تناقض: see 8. ―
-b2-  تَنَاقُضٌ also signifies
(tropical:)  Mutual contradiction, or repugnancy; contr.
of تَوَافُقٌ. (O, TA.) You say, فِى كَلَامِهِ تَنَاقُضٌ
(A, Mgh, Msb, TA,) (tropical:)  [In his speech is contradiction, or repugnancy, between different parts;]
one part of his speech necessarily implies the
annulment of another part; (Msb;) his second
saying contradicted (نَاقَضَ) his first. (TA.)
And تَنَاقَضَ القَوْلَانِ, (A, Mgh,) or الكَلَامَانِ,
(Msb,) (tropical:)  The two saying, or sentences, contradicted each other; or were mutually repugnant;
as though each undid the other; (Msb;) [they
annulled each other.] And تناقض الشَّاعِرَانِ (tropical:)  [The
two poets contradicted each other.] (A, TA.)
And تناقض مَعْنَاهُ (tropical:)  Its meaning was contradictory.
(S, * K, TA.)
-A2-  [It is also used transitively:]
you say, تَنَاقَضَا البَيْعَ (assumed tropical:)  They two mutually dissolved the sale: as though compared with the
saying تَرَآءَوُا الهِلَالَ, meaning “ they [together]
saw the new moon; ” and تَدَاعَوُا القَوْمَ, meaning
“ they [together] called the people; ” and تَسَآءَلُوهُمْ,
meaning “ they [together] asked them; ” notwithstanding that تناقض is [properly] intransitive.
(Mgh.) And تَنَاقَضُوا عُهُودَهُمْ (assumed tropical:)  [They mutually
dissolved, or broke, their compacts, contracts, or
covenants]. (T, voce تناكثوا.)
8
انتقض quasi-pass. of نَقَضَهُ [It became undone; taken, or pulled to pieces: untwisted:
unravelled: unwoven: dissolved; broken: or rendered uncompact, unsound, or infirm, after it had
been made compact, sound, or firm]: (M, A,
Mgh, Msb, TA:) as also ↓ تنقّض, (A,) and
↓ تناقض: (M, TA:) [respecting the first and
last, see a remark upon a mistake in the K, following the first sentence in 1: but انتقض afterwards occurs in the K used properly in the
phrase مَا انْتَقَضَ مِنَ البُنْيَانِ:] i. q. اِنْتَكثَ: (S:)
said of a building, or structure: and of a rope,
or cord: (A, Mgh, Msb, TA:) [and of silk, or
flax: and of cloth: (see 1:)] and (tropical:)  of a compact,
contract, or covenant: (TA:) [and of a sale:
(see 1:)] and (tropical:)  of other things. (A, TA.) ―
-b2-
[Hence,] انتقضت القَرْحَةُ (tropical:)  The wound, or ulcer,
became recrudescent. (IF, * A.) And انتقض
الجُرْحُ بَعْدَ بُرْئِهِ (assumed tropical:)  The wound became in a bad, or
corrupt, state, after its healing. (Msb.) And
انتقض الأَمْرُ بَعْدَ الْتِئَامِهِ (A, * Msb, TA) (tropical:)  The
affair, or case, became in a bad, or unsound state,
after it had been in a sound state. (Msb.) And
انتقض أَمْرُ الثَّغْرِ بَعْدَ سَدِّهِ (assumed tropical:)  [The state of the place
through which the invasion of an enemy was feared
became unfortified, after its being fortified, or
closed]. (TA.) And انتقضت الطَّهَارَةُ (assumed tropical:)  The state
of purity became annulled. (Msb.) And انتقض
عَلَيْهِ الشِّعْرُ (tropical:)  [The poetry became undone, annulled,
or contradicted, by a reply against him: see
يَنْقُضُ عَلَيْهِ]. (A, TA.)
11
انقاضّ It (a wall) cracked, without falling
down; like إِنْقَضَّ. (K in art. قض.) See also
إِنْقَاضَ, in art. قيض.]
نُقْضٌ: see نِقْضٌ, in two places.
نِقْضٌ i. q. ↓ مَنْقُوضٌ [Undone; taken, or pulled,
to pieces: untwisted: unravelled: unwoven: dissolved; broken: &c. (see 1:)] (S, Mgh, Msb,
K:) like نِكْثٌ (S, TA) in the sense of مَنْكُوثٌ:
(TA:) as also ↓ نُقْضٌ; (Mgh, Msb;) and
↓ نَقَضٌ: (Sgh:) but El-Ghooree allows only the
first: (Mgh:) Az, however, mentions only the
second; (Msb;) which signifies as above, applied
to a building, or structure; (M, Mgh;) or what
has become taken, or pulled, to pieces, (مَا انْتَقَضَ,)
of a building, or structure; (K;) as also the
first: (TA:) or نَقْضٌ signifies مَا نَقَضْتَ what
thou hast undone; taken, or pulled, to pieces;
untwisted; &c.]: (M:) and what is undone, of
[the stuff of the tents called] أَخْبِيَة, and of [the
garments called] أَكْسِيَة, and twisted a second
time; (M, K;) as also ↓ نَقَضٌ; (K;) and
↓ نُقَاضَةٌ: (L:) or this last signifies what is
undone of a hair-rope: (S, O, K:) the pl. of
نِقْضٌ is أَنْقَاضٌ [a pl. of pauc.], (M,) and of
the same, (Msb,) or of ↓ نُقْضٌ, (Mgh, Msb,)
نُقُوضٌ. (Mgh, Msb.) ―
-b2-  (tropical:)  Emaciated, or rendered lean, (S, M, K,) by travel; (S, K;) upon
which one has journeyed time after time: (O:)
Seer says, as though travel had unknit its frame;
(M, TA;) thus indicating it to be tropical:
(TA:) applied to a male camel, (S, M, K,) and
to a horse, (M.) and to a female camel, (S, K,)
or the female is termed نِقْضَةٌ: (M, K:) pl.
أَنْقَاضٌ, (Sb, S, K,) only, (Sb, M,) both of the
masc. and fem.; in the latter, the ة being
imagined to be elided; (M;) and نَقَائِضُ is
[also said to be] a pl. of نِقْضٌ signifying jaded,
applied to a she-camel. (So in a copy of the
S in art. نفص.) ―
-b3-  [See an ex. in a verse cited
voce سَدٌّ.] ―
-b4-  The place, (S,) or crust of earth,
(M, K,) that becomes broken from over truffles;
(S, M, K;) for when they are about to come
forth, they break asunder the surface of the
earth: (O:) pl. [of pauc.] أَنْقَاضٌ and [of mult.]
نُقُوضٌ. (M, K.) ―
-b5-  Accord. to the K, i. q.
نِفْضٌ; but the latter is a mistranscription;
(TA;) Honey that has in it [worms of the kind
called] سُوس; wherefore it is taken, (M, K in
art. نفض,) and pounded, (K, ubi supra,) and the
place of the bees is smeared (يُلَطَّخُ [in a copy
of the M يُطْبَخُ, which is doubtless a mistranscription,]) therewith, together with myrtle (آس)
and the bees then come to it, and deposit
their honey in it; (M, K, ubi supra;) on the
authority of El-Hejeree: (M:) or the dung
of bees in the place where they deposit their
honey: (IAar, AHn, K, ubi supra:) or the bees
that have died therein. (Sgh, K, ubi supra.)
-A2-  See also نَقِيضٌ.
نَقَضٌ: see نِقْضٌ, in two places.
نَقِيضٌ (tropical:)  A contradictor: applied to a man:
fem. with ة. (M, TA.) You say [also], ذَا
نقيضُ ذَاكَ (tropical:)  This is a contradictor [i. e. the contrary] of that: (A, TA:) [or this is inconsistent
with that: for] النَّقِيضَانِ لَا يَجْتَمِعَانِ وَلَا يَرْتَفِعَانِ
[what are termed نقيضان cannot be coëxistent in
the same thing, nor simultaneously nonexistent
in the same thing]; as existence itself and nonexistence, and motion and rest. (Kull, pp. 231,
232) You say also, هٰذِهِ قَصِيدَةٌ نَقِيضُ قَصِيدَةِ
فُلَانٍ (tropical:)  [This poem is a contradictor of the poem
of such a one]. (A.) And النَّقِيضَةُ in poetry is
(tropical:)  That by which one undoes or annuls or contradicts [what another poet has said]: (S:) or
نَقِيضَةُ الشِّعْرِ consists in a poet's putting forth
poetry, and another poet's undoing or annulling
or contradicting it, by putting forth what is different therefrom: (Lth, K, * TA:) the subst
is نَقِيضٌ: [or rather this seems to be an epithet
in which the quality of a subst. is predominant,
and syn. with نَقِيضَةٌ:] and the act of the two is
termed ↓ مُنَاقَضَةٌ: the pl. of نَقِيضَةٌ is نَقَائِضُ:
(TA:) you speak of the نَقَائِض of Jereer and
El-Farezdak. (A, TA.)
-A2-  A sound, noise,
voice, or cry; (Lth, S, M, O, K:) as also
↓ نِقْضٌ accord to the K; but this is an enormous
error: (TA:) the former, of the joints (Lth,
M, K) of a man, (M,) [a meaning also assigned
to نِقْضٌ in the K,] and of the fingers, and of the
ribs, (Lth, M, A,) and of camels' saddles, (S,
K,) or of a camel's saddle, (M, O, K, [but in
CK, for الرَّحْل, we find الرِّجْل, the foot,]) and of
camels' litters, (S, K,) and of tanned skins, (K,)
or of a tanned skin, (M,) and of a bow-string,
(M, K,) and of نِسْع [q. v.] (O, K,) when new,
(O,) and of the sucking of a cupping-instrument;
(K;) [in all these senses said in the TA to be
tropical; but see 4;] and also the former, (S,
M, TA,) in the K, erroneously, the latter word,
(TA,) of an eagle, (S, M, K,) and of chickens,
and of an ostrich, and of a quail, and of a hawk,
and of a scorpion, and of a frog, and of the [kind
of lizard called] وَزَغ, and of the وَبْر [or Syrian
hyrax; &c., see 4] (M,)
