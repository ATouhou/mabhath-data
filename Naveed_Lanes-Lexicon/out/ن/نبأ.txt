The land brought, or led him: (S, L:) [accord.
to Golius, The land brought, or produced, it: but
it is a phrase well known to the learned among
the Arabs in the present day, as similar to نَادَاهُ
تُرَابُهُ “ his dust, or earth, (i. e. the place of his
burial,) called him: ” and the explanation which I
have given is confirmed by the citation, in the S,
of the following verse, of Hanash Ibn-Málik,
immediately after نبأت به in the sense of جاءت به:]
فَنَفْسَكَ أَحْرِزْ فَإِنَّ الحُتُو
فَ يَنْبَأْنَ بِالمَرْءِ فِى كُلِّ وَادْ

-b2-  Es-Semeen says, that انبأ and
نبّأ and اخبر and خبّر, when they convey the
meaning of knowledge, are triply transitive, or
may govern three objective complements, the
greatest number that any verb can govern: (TA:)
[ex. أَنْبَأْتُ زَيْدًا عَمْرًا قَائِمًا I acquainted Zeyd that
'Amr was standing]. ―
-b3-  It is also said, that ↓ نبّأ
has a more intensive signification than انبأ: ex.
مَنْ أَنْبَأَكَ هٰذَا قَالَ نَبَّأَنِى العَلِيمُ الخَبِيرُ [Who
hath acquainted thee with this? He said, The
Knowing, the Intelligent (God), hath apprized me:

10
استنبأ النَّبَأَ He sought, or searched after,

-b2-  وَيَسْتَنْبِئُونَكَ أَحَقٌّ هُوَ
(in the Kur, x. 54) means And they will ask thee
to inform them, [saying,] Is it true? (Bd.)
نَبَأٌ Information; a piece of information; intelligence; an announcement; news; tidings; a piece of
news; an account; a narrative, or narration; a
story: or what is related from another or others: syn.
خَبَرٌ: (S, Msb, K:) it is generally held to be syn.
with خَبَرٌ; but accord. to Er-Rághib, signifies
an announcement of great utility, from which results either knowledge or a predominance of opinion,
and true: (TA:) pl. أَنْبَآءُ. (K.) ―

[Kur, lxxviii. 2,] accord. to some, The Kur-án:
others say, the resurrection: and others, the case

نَبِىْءٌ, (S, K,) pronounced with ء in the dial.
of the people of Mekkeh, (S,) whose pronunciation of it is disapproved by Sb on account of its
uncommonness; (TA;) by others, نَبِىٌّ, without ء;
(S, K, TA;) A prophet: (TA:) of the measure
فَعِيلٌ used in the sense of the measure مُفْعل [i. e.
مُفْعِلٌ or مَفْعَلٌ] (IB) or فَاعِلٌ (S, Es-Sunoosee)
or مَفْعُولٌ; (Es-Sunoosee) i. e., who acquaints or
informs mankind, (S, K, TA,) or who is acquainted
or informed, respecting God and things unseen:
or accord. to some, it is derived from نَبْوَةٌ and
نَبَاوَةٌ signifying “ elevation; ” (see art. نبو;)
in which case it is originally without ء: or,
accord. to others, from نَبِىْءٌ in a sense given
below; that of “ a conspicuous way. ” (TA.)
It is a less special word than رَسُولٌ [when thereby
is meant an apostle of God]; for every رسول is
a نبىّ, but not every نبىّ is a رسول. (TA.) Pl.
أَنْبِيَآءُ (S, K, without ء, because the ء is changed into
ى in the sing., S,) and نُبَأءُ (S, K, like كُرَمَآءُ [pl. of
كَرِيمٌ] TA,) and أَنْبَآءٌ [K, these two preserving
the original radical ء] and نَبِيُّونَ, (K,) without ء:
(TA:) but some pronounced the first and last of
these pls., in the Kur-án, with ء; though the
more approved pronunciation is without ء. (TA.)
The dim. is نُبَيّئٌ, (S, K,) with those who make
the pl. نُبَأءٌ [or أَنْبَآءٌ]; but with those who make
the pl. أَنْبِيَآء, it is نُبَىٌّ. (K.) ―
-b2-  An Arab of
the desert said to Mohammad, يَا نَبِىْءَ اللّٰهِ, and
the latter disapproved of his pronouncing نبىء in
this case with ء, because, as it signifies An emigrant, he meant thereby to call him an emigrant
from Mekkeh to El-Medeeneh. (S, K, TA.) ―
-b3-
نَبِىْءٌ A conspicuous, an evident, or a clear, way.
(K.) Hence, accord. to some, the apostle [or
rather prophet] is so called, because he is the
conspicuous, evident, way, that conducts to God.
(MF.) ―
-b4-  نَبِىْءٌ and ↓ نَابِئٌ An elevated, or a
protuberant, or gibbous, place. (K.) ―
-b5-  Hence
it is said in a trad., لَا تُصَلُّوا عَلَى النَّبِىْءِ [Pray
not upon the place that is elevated, or protuberant]. (K.)
نُبُوْءَةٌ, (K, in the CK نُبُوَّة) in which the ء is
sometimes softened in pronunciation, and sometimes [or rather generally] changed into و which
is incorporated into the preceding و so that the
word is written and pronounced نُبُوَّةٌ, (TA,)
Prophecy; the gift of prophecy; the office, or
function, of a prophet. (MA, K.) Dim. نُبَيِّئَةٌ.
(S, K.)

ye any current news? or — news from a distant
place? &c.: see جائبة]. (A.)
