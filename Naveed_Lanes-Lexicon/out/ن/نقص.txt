نقص1
نَقَصَ, (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.
نَقُصَ, (M,
Msb,) inf. n. نُقْصَانٌ (S, M, A, Mgh, Msb, K)
and نَقْصٌ, (S, M, A, Msb, K,) or the former of
these two only, the latter being the inf. n. of the
trans. verb, (MS,) and نَقِيصَةٌ (M) and تَنْقَاصٌ,
(K,) [which last is an intensive form,] said of a
thing, (S, M,) intrans., (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,)
It lost somewhat, decreased, diminished, lessened,
wasted, waned, or became defective or deficient or
incomplete or imperfect, after having been whole
or complete or perfect: (IKtt, Msb, TA:) or he,
or it, lost, or suffered loss or diminution, (A, K,)
with respect to lot or portion: (K:) and ↓ انتقص
signifies the same; (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K;) and
so does ↓ تنقّص; (TK, [probably from the TA,]
art. أَفن;) and so does ↓ تناقص: (TA:) [or this last
signifies it lost somewhat, decreased, &c., gradually;
contr. of تزايد.] It is said in a trad., (Mgh,)
شَهْرَا عِيدٍ لَا يَنْقُصَانِ, (Mgh, K,) i. e. Ramadán and
Dhu-l-Hijjeh, (Mgh,) meaning, Two months of
festival are not defective virtually (فِى الحُكْمِ)
though they be defective in number [of days];
(K;) i. e. let no doubt occur in your hearts when
ye fast nine and twenty days [instead of thirty];
nor if there happen a mistake respecting the day
of the pilgrimage, will there be any deficiency in
your performance of the rites thereof: (TA:) or,
as some say, two months of festival will not be
defective in one and the same year; but Et-
Taháwee disapproves of this explanation: some
say that the meaning is, that though they be
defective, or one of them be so, yet their recompense will be complete. (Mgh.) It is also said
in a trad., إِنَّ العَمَلَ فِى عَشْرِ ذِى الحِجَّةِ لَا يَنْقُصُ
ثَوَابُهُ عَمَّا فِى شَهْرِ رَمَضَانَ [Verily the deed that is
done on the tenth of Dhu-l-Hijjeh, the recompense
thereof will not fall short of that which is in the
month of Ramadán: for نَقَصَ عَنْ كَذَا means It
fell short of such a thing.] (Mgh.) [On the expression فِى النُّقْصَانِ, as used in grammar, see غَفِيرٌ.]
-A2-
نَقَصَهُ, (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.
نَقُصَ, (Msb,) inf.
n. نَقْصٌ, (MS,) [and accord. to the TK تَنْقَاصٌ
and نُقْصَانٌ also, which last, however, is said in
the MS to be an inf. n. of the intrans. verb only,]
He made it to lose somewhat, decreased it, diminished it, curtailed it, lessened it, wasted it,
impaired it, took from it, or made it defective or
deficient or incomplete or imperfect, after it had
been whole or complete or perfect; (Msb;) he
made it (i. e. a share, or portion) defective or
deficient: (K:) [the pronoun often relates to a
man: see an ex. in art. ضوز, and another in art.
وكس:] this is the [most] chaste form of the
verb, and is that which occurs in the Kur.:
(Msb:) ↓ انقصهُ also signifies the same; (M,
Msb, K;) and so does ↓ نقّصهُ, (Msb, K,) inf. n.
تَنْقِيصٌ: (TA:) but these two are of weak
authority, and do not occur in chaste language:
(Msb:) and ↓ انتقصهُ signifies the same: (S,
Mgh, Msb, K:) or this last signifies he took from
it by little and little; as also ↓ تنقّصهُ. (M, *
TA [in the latter of which this is plainly said of
both of the last two verbs; but in the M, it seems
rather to be said of تنقّصه only.]) [See an ex.
of the verb followed by من voce طَرَفٌ. You say
also, نَقَصَ مِنْهُ كَذَا He cut off from it such a thing.]
―
-b2-  نَقَصَ is doubly trans.: (Msb:) you say نَقَصَهُ
حَقَّهُ, (A, Mgh, Msb, TA,) inf. n. نَقْصٌ; (A,
Mgh;) and in like manner, حَقَّهُ ↓ انتقصهُ; (M,
A, * Mgh, * TA; *) He diminished, or impaired,
to him his right, or due; endamaged him; or
made him to suffer loss, or damage, or detriment,
in respect of it; curtailed him, abridged him,
deprived him, or defrauded him, of a portion of
it; (Msb, * TA;) contr. of أَوْفَاهُ: (TA:) [and
he abridged him, deprived him, or defrauded him,
of it altogether; for نَقَصَهُ أَهْلَهُ وَمَالَهُ signifies
sometimes He deprived him of his family and his
property altogether: as appears from the following
ex.:] نُقِصَ أَهْلَهُ وَمَالَهُ وَبَقِىَ فَرْدًا [He was deprived
of his family and his property, and remained
alone]. (T, art. وتر.) الحَقِّ ↓ اِنْتِقَاصُ also signifies The denying, or disacknowledging, the right,
or due. (TA.) ―

a man; (M;) as also ↓ انتقصهُ, and ↓ استنقصهُ:
(M, TA:) he attributed or imputed to him,
charged him with, or accused him of, a vice,
fault, or the like; detracted from his reputation;
censured him; reproached him; spoke against
him; impugned his character; (S, A, K;) as
also ↓ انتقصهُ: (A:) [and نَقَصَهُ signifies the same;
for] IKtt says, that ↓ نقص [app. نُقِصَ], inf. n.
نَقِيصَةٌ, signifies طعن عليه [app. طُعِنَ عَلَيْهِ].
(TA.)

تَنَاْقَصَ see نَقَصَ, where two meanings are assigned

نَقْصٌ: see 1. ―
-b2-  [Used as a subst., Loss, or
loss of somewhat, decrease, a state of diminution or
lessening or washing or waning, defect, defectiveness, deficiency, incompleteness, or imperfection,
after wholeness or completeness, or perfectness;
as also ↓ نُقْصَانٌ; and ↓ مَنْقَصَةٌ signifies the same
as نَقْص] as here rendered, agreeably with the
explanation (i. e. of منقصة) in the PS., which
is كَمِىْ: or, accord. to the A, مَنْقَصَةٌ seems to
be syn. with نَقِيصَةٌ in the sense assigned to this
last in the S, or in certain senses assigned to it
in the K, which see below; and thus to be more
restricted in application than نَقْصٌ]. (S, TA.)
―
-b3-  Weakness of intellect: (M, TA:) and weakness with respect to religion and intellect. (TA.)
You say, دَخَلَ عَلَيْهِ نَقْصٌ فِى دِينِهِ وَعَقْلِهِ
[There came upon him a weakness in his religion
and his intellect]: but one should not say
↓ نُقْصَانٌ [in this case]: (K:) app. because
النَّقْص is “ weakness; ” whereas النُّقْصَانُ is only
“ a going away [of part of a thing] after [its
having been in] a state of completeness. ” (TA.)
نُقْصَانٌ: see 1: ―
-b2-  see also نَقْصٌ, in two places.
―
-b3-  It also signifies The quantity that is gone, or
lost, of a thing that is decreased or diminished or
lessened. (Lth, A, K.) You say, نُقْصَانُهُ كَذَا
وَكَذَا The quantity that is gone, or lost, of it is
such and such. (TK.)
نَقِيصَةٌ: see 1. ―
-b2-  A defect, an imperfection, a
fault, a vice, or the like; syn. عَيْبٌ: (S, TA:)
or a low, or base, quality, property, natural
disposition, practice, habit, or action; (K, TA;)
of a man: (TA:) or a weak quality, &c.:
(IDrd, K, TA:) but the attribution of weakness
to a quality, &c., requires consideration: and
it seems that what is meant by lowness, or baseness, is what leads to نَقْص: (TA:) [↓ مَنْقَصَةٌ,
also, accord. to the A, seems to be syn. with
نَقِيصَةٌ in one or another of the senses explained
above; but its primary signification is probably
a cause of نَقْص, like as that of مَبْخَلَةٌ is a cause
of بُخْل, and that of مَجْبَنَةٌ a cause of جُبْن:
the pl. of نَقِيصَةٌ is نَقَائِصُ: and that of مَنْقَصَةٌ is
مَنَاقِصُ.] You say, مَا فِيهِ نَقِيصَةٌ and ↓ مَنْقَصَةٌ
[There is not in him any defect, imperfection,
fault, or vice, &c.]: and فُلَانٌ ذُو نَقَائِصَ and
مَنَاقِصَ [Such a one has defects, &c.]. (A, TA.)
-A2-
As a subst. from تَنَقَّصَهُ and اِنْتَقَصَهُ and اِسْتَنْقَصَهُ,
[or, accord. to IKtt, as an inf. n. from نُقِص,
and therefore from نَقَصَهُ also, (see 5,)] it signifies
The attributing to a man defect, or imperfection:
(M:) the attributing or imputing to men, charging them with, or accusing them of, vices, faults,
or the like; censuring them; reproaching them;
speaking against them; impugning their characters. (K.) A poet says,
فَلَوْ غَيْرُ أَخْوَالِى أَرَادُوا نَقِيصَتِى
جَعَلْتُ لَهُمْ فَوْقَ العَرَانِينِ مِيسَمَا
[But if others than my maternal uncles had
desired to attribute to me defect, &c., I had set a
brand upon them above the noses]. (M, TA.)
نَاقِصٌ act. part. n. of 1. ―
-b2-  دِرْهَمٌ نَاقِضٌ signifies A
dirhem deficient in weight; (Msb;) light and
deficient: and نُقَّصٌ occurs as pl. of ناقص thus
applied, agreeably with analogy. (Mgh.) ―
-b3-
[Hence, فِعْلٌ نَاقِصٌ meaning An incomplete,
i. e. a non-attributive, verb: opposed to فِعْلٌ تَامٌّ.]
مَنْقَصَةٌ: pl. مَنَاقِصُ: see نَقِيصَةٌ, in four places:
―
-b2-  and see also نَقْصٌ.
