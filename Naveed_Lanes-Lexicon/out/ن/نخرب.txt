نخربQ. 1
نَخْرَبَ It (a canker-worm) pierced holes
in, or eroded, a tree. (K.) IJ derives this verb
from خَرَابٌ, (TA,) q. v.
نُخْرُوبٌ; (S, K;) mentioned in the K without
description of its measure because there is no
Arabic word of the measure فَعْلُولْ; but some
prefer it being written نَخْرُوبٌ, [as it is in the
CK,] asserting its ن to be augmentative, so that
its measure is نَفْعُولٌ, as IAar holds, asserting it
to be derived from خَرَابٌ; (TA;) A fissure, or
cleft, in a stone. (S, K.) ―
-b2-  Also, [so in the
TA: in the CK and a MS. copy, or,] A hole,
perforation, or bore, in anything. (K.) Pl.
نَخَارِيبُ. (S.) ―
-b3-  Also, the pl., The holes, or
cells, prepared with wax for the bees to deposit
their honey therein: (K:) holes like the cells of
wasps. (L.)
نَخْرَبُوتٌ [i. q. تَخْرَبُوتٌ] An excellent, nimble, or
agile, she-camel. Some say that its ن is augmentative, and its radical letters are خرب; but
its derivation from خَرَابٌ is not apparent; therefore its ن should be considered as radical.
(AHei.)
شَجَرَةٌ مُنَخْرِبَةٌ, and مُنَخْرَبَةٌ, A tree that is old
and pierced with holes. (K.)
