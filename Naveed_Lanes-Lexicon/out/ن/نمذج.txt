is said to be a corruption in the TS and the K;
but this is denied by El-Khafájee and by Mtr;
and learned men, in early and in late times, have
constantly used the word انموذج without any
expression of disapproval; Z and El-Hasan Ibn-Rasheek El-Keyrawánee, two leading lexicologists, having even named thereby books written
by them; (MF;) vulgo نَمُونَه [which is a Persian
word]; (TA;) A model, an exemplar, a pattern,
or a likeness of a thing, after the similitude of
which a thing is made: (Msb:) a model, or likeness, of a thing; (K;) i. e., a thing that is made
in the form, or after the fashion, of another thing,
that the mode of the latter may be known thereby:
(TA:) a thing which shows the mode, or quality,
or qualities, of another thing: (Msb:) an arabicized word, (K,) from [the Persian] نَمُودَهْ.
