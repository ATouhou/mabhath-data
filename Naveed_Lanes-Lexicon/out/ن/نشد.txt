نَشُدَ, (S, Msb. &c.,)
inf. n. نَشْدٌ (L, Msb, K) and نِشْدَةٌ and نِشْدَانٌ,
(S, M, L, K,) or these two are simple substs.,
(Msb,) He raised his voice in seeking for, or after,
a stray-beast, or beast that had been lost; he
called out and inquired respecting it; he cried it:
(L:) or he sought for, or after, it: (Lh, A'Obeyd,
S, M, L, Msb, K:) and [in like manner] ↓ انشد
he asked, or desired, to be directed to it. (M, L, K.)
―
-b2-  Also, He made known, or gave information
of, a stray-beast, or beast that had been lost;
(Lh, A'Obeyd, M, L, Msb K;) and so ↓ انشد:
(Lh, S, M, IKtt, L, Msb, K:) thus the latter
verb [as well as the former] bears two contr.
significations. (M, K.) See also نَاشِدٌ. ―

him. (M, * L, * K.) ―
-b7-  نَشَدَهُ بِاللّٰهِ (tropical:)  He adjured
him by God; (L, K; *) accord. to most of
the grammarians and lexicologists, with a
desire of conciliating him. (MF.) ―

نَشُدَ, T, S,) inf. n. نَشْدٌ, (tropical:)  He said to him
نَشَدْتُكَ اللّٰهَ, (S, L, K,) which signifies I conjure,
beg, or beseech, thee by God; (S, A, Mgh, L,
Msb, K;) as though thou remindedst him of God,
and he remembered; (S, L;) as also أَنْشُدُكَ اللّٰهَ,
and بِاللّٰهِ, (L,) and اللّٰهَ ↓ نَاشَدْتُكَ, (A, Mgh, L,)
and باللّٰه: (Mgh, L, Msb:) originally, I conjure
thee by God, raising my voice: (Et-Towsheeh:)
or it signifies I remind thee of God, conjuring;

signifies I adjure thee by God; as also ↓ أَنْشَدْتُكَ
بِاللّٰهِ; (M, L,) or this latter is erroneous: (Mgh,
L:) and so signifies نَشْدَكَ اللّٰهَ; (M, L, K;) in
which نَشْد is said to be originally نَشْدَة, an
inf. n. put in the place of the verb, or نشدك اللّٰه
is a phrase of unpremeditated formation, like
قَعْدَكَ اللّٰهَ and عَمْرَكَ اللّٰهَ; or this phrase, which
occurs in a trad., may be incorrectly transmitted,
and should perhaps be أَنْشُدُكَ اللّٰهَ: (IAth, L:)
or نَشَدَهُ signifies he said to him نَشَدْتُكَ بِاللّٰهِ
والرَّحِمِ [I conjure thee, or adjure thee, by God
