نربQ. Q. 1
الرِّيحُ تُنَيْرِبُ التُّرَابَ فَوْقَهُ, or عَلَى
الأَرْضِ, (TA,) inf. n. نَيْرَبَةٌ, (TA,) The wind
lays the dust upon it, or upon the ground, in
cross, wavy lines: syn. تَنْسِجُهُ. (K.) Hence
نَيْرَبَ الكَلَام. (TA.) ―
-b2-  It has been asserted
that ن and ر do not come together in any [pure]
Arabic word; and F has said the same in art.
نرش; [or rather he has there said that ر does
not occur in an Arabic word with ن before it;
(meaning a radical ن;)] yet he has here mentioned this word as though it were pure Arabic.
So says MF. To this it may be replied, that ى
is inserted to separate the ن and ر, as remarked
in the L. (TA.) ―
-b3-  نَيْرَبَ He forged [speech,
or language]: syn. نَسَجَ. (K.) You say هُوَ يُنَيْرِبُ
القَوْلَ. (TA.) ―
-b4-  نَيْرَبَ He mixed, or confounded,
speech, [introducing what was false with that
which was true]. (K.) ―
-b5-  نَيْرَبَ He uttered a
malicious and mischievous misrepresentation, a
calumny, or slander. (K.)
نَيْرَبٌ (S, K) and ↓ نَيْرَبَةٌ (as in several copies
of the K, [and I am inclined to think that this
is the correct reading, as it may certainly be
correctly used in the sense here given, being
properly an inf. n., agreeably with analogy,] or
↓ مَنْرَبَةٌ (as in others, which is said in the TA to
be the correct word, and to be given on the
authority of AA, [but it exhibits an incongruity
of letters: see 1:]) Mischief; malicious and mischievous misrepresentation, calumny, or slander.
(S, K.) ―
-b2-  نَيْرَبٌ, fem. with ة; and ذُو نَيْرَبٍ;
