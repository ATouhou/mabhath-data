نبت1
نَبَتَ, (S, M, K,) aor.
نَبُتَ, inf. n. نَبْتٌ and
نَبَاتٌ; [which two ns. see mentioned as substs.;]
and ↓ تنبّت; (M;) and ↓ انبت; (Fr, S, K;)
[respecting which last see below;] It (a thing,
M, or a leguminous [or other] plant, S, K,)
grew; grew forth; sprouted; vegetated; or germinated. (S, M, K.) As disallows ↓ انبت in
this sense; but AO allows it, alleging the words
of Zuheyr, البَقْلُ ↓ حَتَّى إِذَا أَنْبَتَ [Until, when
the leguminous plants grew]. نَبَتَ and ↓ أَنْبَتَ
are said to be like مَطَرَتِ السَّمآءُ and أَمْطَرَت. In
the Kur, xxiii. 20, Ibn-Ketheer, Aboo-'Amr and
El-Hadremee read تُنْبِتُ: others, تَنْبُتُ: but
ISd says, that, accord. to the former reading,
some hold ب, which follows تُنْبِتُ, to be redundant; and others hold that مَا تُنْبُتُ is understood after تُنْبِتُ. Fr holds them to be syn.

syn., (S, K,) [signifying A plant, a herb: and
plants, herbs, or herbage:] whatever God causes
to grow, vegetate, or germinate, in the earth:
(Lth:) the latter is an inf. n. used as a subst.:
(Lth:) or it is a subst. which is used in the place
of an inf. n. of أَنْبَتَ: (Fr:) n. un. of the former

خَبِيتٌ نَبِيتٌ Vile, and contemptible, or despicable: (Lh, K:) said of a man, and of a thing.

by أَعْضَادُ الفُلْجَانِ: so in the L, &c.: in several
copies of the K we read, in the place of اعضاد,
اغصان: but this is a mistake. (TA.)

مَنْبَتٌ: see مَنْبِتٌ.
مَنْبِتٌ (tropical:)  Origin, or race, [from which a man

مَنْبِتِ صِدْقٍ (tropical:)  Verily he belongs to an excellent race; is

(TA.) ―
-b2-  مَنْبِتٌ A place in which plants, or
herbs, grow: (S, K:) dev. from the constant
course of speech: analogically it should be
↓ مَنْبَتٌ: (K:) as the aor. of the verb from
which it is derived is not يَنْبِتُ, with kesreh:
but there are other examples like it; as مَسجِدٌ
and مَطْلِعٌ &c.: ↓ مَنْبَتٌ, however, also sometimes
occurs. (TA.) [Pl. مَنَابِتُ.]
أَرْضٌ مِنْبَاتٌ [Land abounding with plants, or
herbage]. (K, voce رَحَبَةٌ, &c.)

مُتَنَبِّتٌ Firmly rooted; syn. مُتَأَصِّلٌ. (TA.)
تَنْبِيتٌ and ↓ تِنْبِيتٌ, (K,) the latter so written,
not as being so originally, but for the sake of
agreement in sound [with respect to the first and
second vowels], (AHei,) a subst., signifying
What grows or germinates, of slender (i. e. small,
TA,) trees, [or shrubs,] and large: (K:) ex.,
بَيْدَآءُ لَمْ يَنْبُتْ بِهَا تَنْبِيتُ
[A desert in which there grew not aught of shrubs
or of large trees]: (TA:) young shoots of palmtrees: (IKtt:) the prickles and branches that
are cut off from a palm-tree, to lighten it.

the hump of a camel. (L.)
تِنْبِيثٌ: see تَنْبِيثٌ.
يَنْبُوتٌ [coll. gen. n.] A certain species of trees:
(S:) poppy-plants; syn. شَجَرُ الخَشْخَاش: and
other trees of a large kind: or the trees called
خرّوب [see below]: (K:) or a kind of thorny
trees, having branches and leaves, with a fruit of
the kind called جِرْو, i. e., round; called in 'Omán
غاف: n. un. with ة: AHn says that there are
two species of ينبوت; one of these is a kind of
thorny and short trees, also called خَرُّوب [q. v.]
having a fruit resembling a bubble, in which are
red grains, having an astringent effect upon the
bowels, used as a medicine; the other species is a
large species of trees: ISd says, An Arab of the
desert, of the tribe of Rabeea, described to me
the ينبوتة as [a tree] resembling a large apple-tree,
the leaves of which are smaller than those of the
apple, having a fruit smaller than the زُعْرُور, intensely black and intensely sweet, with grains, or
stones, which are put into scales, or balances:
[evidently meaning the carob, or locust-tree, (see
خَرُّوب,) whence our term “ carob,” applied to a
small weight, the twenty-fourth part of a grain].
(L [See غَافٌ and فُرْفُورٌ].)
