يَوْمُ التَّنَادِّ (S, M, L, K,) [The day of men's dispersing themselves, and betaking themselves in
different directions], applied to the day of resurrection: (M, L:) so in the Kur, [xl. 34,] accord.
to the reading of some; (S, M, L, K;) namely
El-'Abbás and others: (K:) Az says, accord. to
the reading of Ed-Dahhák only: (L:) others
read التَّنَادِ; which may also be from ندّ; one
of the dáls being changed into ى, and being then
elided: (T, L:) or this may be from النِّدَآءُ:
(M:) or يوم التنادّ may mean the day of men's
assembling themselves together, from نَدَّ signifying

(accord. to Aboo-'Amr Ibn-El-'Alà, T, L) ambergris, عَنْبَرٌ: (T, L:) or عَبِيرٌ [i. e., either saffron,
or a certain mixture of perfumes: so in the copy
of the T used by the author of the TT, if correctly
transcribed by him:] it is not Arabic: (S:) or
is thought by IDrd to be not genuine Arabic:
(M, L,) many of the lexicologists, however, hold
it to be genuine Arabic; and it occurs in verses
of old poets; (MF;) but this does not prove
that it is not an arabicized word. (TA.)
-A2-  نَدٌّ

that opposes it (يُنَحادُّهُ, i. e., يُخَالِفُهُ,) in its circumstances; (L;) syn. with ضِدٌّ and شِبْهٌ:

the true God: (L:) pl. of the first, أَنْدَادٌ; (L,
Msb, K;) and of the second, نُدَدَآءُ; and of the
third, نَدَائِدُ. (K.) You say, هُوَ نِدُّ فُلَانٍ, and
نَدِيدُهُ, and نَديِدَتْهُ, He is the like of such a one:
(L:) and هِىَ نِدُّ فُلَانَةَ, (ISh, L, K,) She is the
like of such a female; (ISh, L;) but not نِدُّ فُلَانٍ.
(ISh, L, K.) You also say هُوَ نِدِّى, and نَدِيدِى,
