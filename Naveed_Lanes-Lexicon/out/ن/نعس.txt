نعس1
نَعَسَ, (S, A, Msb, K,) aor.
نَعُسَ, (S, M, and
so in a copy of the B by the author of the K,)
or
نَعَسَ, (A, K,) [the latter being agreeable with
analogy,] inf. n. نُعَاسٌ, (S, A, K, * TA,) or this
is a simple subst., (Msb,) [He drowsed; he was,
or became, drowsy, or heavy with sleepiness: or
he slumbered, or dozed:] the inf. n. is syn. with
وَسَنٌ: (S, A, K:) or ↓ نُعَاسٌ signifies languor
in the senses, (K, TA,) arising from the heaviness
[which is the prevenient sign] of sleep: (TA:)
or the beginning of sleep: (M, art. وسن:) or its
proper signification is, accord. to Az, (Msb, TA,)
وَسَنٌ (Msb) or سِنَةٌ (TA) without sleep: (Msb,
TA,) or سِنَةٌ is in the head, and نُعَاسٌ is in the
eye: or سنة is the vapour (ريح) of sleep which
begins in the face, then is transmitted to the
heart, and you say, of a man, يَنْعَسُ, and then,
يَنَامُ. (Msb, art. نوم.) It is said in a proverb,
مَطْلٌ كَنُعَاسِ الكَلْبِ [A delaying of the payment,
of a debt, or the like, like the drowsing, or slumbering, of the dog:] i. e. continual: (S, TA:)
for the dog is characterized by much نعاس, and,
as is said in the B, is accustomed to open his
eyes [only] sufficiently for the purpose of guarding, and this he does time after time. (TA.) ―

K;) but this latter is rare; (Fr, Th, Msb, K;)
and by some disallowed: (TA:) fem. of the
former with ة: (Msb, TA:) and of the latter
نَعْسَى, made to accord. with وَسْنَى, fem. of وَسْنَانٌ;
and this is best in poetry: (Lth, Msb, TA:) and
↓ نَعَّاسَةٌ is also used as an epithet [in an intensive
sense] applied to a female: (TA:) the pl. of
نَاعِسٌ is نُعَّسٌ; like رَكَّعٌ, pl. of رَاكِعٌ: and that
of نَاعِسَةٌ is نَوَاعِسُ. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  جَدُّهُ نَاعِسٌ (tropical:)  [His
good fortune is slumbering]. (A, TA.)
