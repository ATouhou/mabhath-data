of the stomach of a ruminant beast]: said in

-b5-  نَثَرَ وَلَدًا (tropical:)  He (a man, M)

an ass, T) sneezed [app. so as to scatter the
moisture in his nostrils]: (T, M, K, TA:) or did
with his nose what is like sneezing: (T:) he (an
ass, and a sheep or goat) sneezed, and expelled
what annoyed or hurt him, from his nose: (A:)
or نَثَرَتْ she (a ewe or goat) ejected from her nose
what annoyed or hurt her. (S.) And نَثَرَ, (Fr,

نَثْرٌ (T, Mgh) [and app. نَثِيرٌ, as above], (tropical:)  He [a
man] blew his nose; ejected the mucus from his
nose; syn. امْتَخَطَ; (IAth;) as also ↓ استنثر: (S,
K, art. مخط:) and he ejected what was in his
nose, of mucus, and of that which annoyed or hurt
him, in performing the ablution termed وُضُوْء;
(Sgh, TA;) as also ↓ أَنْثَرَ, accord. to some:
(TA:) or ↓ أَنْثَرَ signifies he ejected what was in
his nose; or he emitted his breath from his nose;
or he introduced the water into his nose; as also
↓ انتثر and ↓ استنثر: (K:) but this last explanation is outweighed in authority; the form ↓ انثر
is disallowed by the leading lexicologists; and
the author of the K, in respect of this form, follows
Sgh, without due consideration: (TA:) [accord.
to the more approved opinion,) نَثَرَ signifies he
scattered what was in his nose by the breath; as
also ↓ انتثر and ↓ استنثر: (S:) or, as some of the
learned say, he snuffed up water, and then ejected
what was in it, of anything annoying or hurting,
or of mucus; as also ↓ استنثر: (IAar, T, Mgh:)
or ↓ استنثر (T, M, IAth, K) and ↓ انتثر, (K,)
he snuffed up water, and then ejected it (T, M,
IAth, K) by the breath of the nose: (T, M, K:)
accord. to some, نَثَرَ and ↓ استنثر signify he (a
person performing وُضُوْء) snuffed up water: but
others say that the latter signifies he ejected what
was in his nose, of mucus &c.; agreeably with
a trad. to be cited below: (Msb:) IAar says,
that ↓ استنثر signifies he snuffed up water, and put
in motion the نَثْرَة, or end of the nose, in purification: (T [in the Mgh, this explanation is ascribed
to Fr:]) and Fr, that نَثَرَ and ↓ انتثر and ↓ استنثر
signify he put in motion the نَثْرَة, in purification.
(T.) It is said of Mohammad, كَانَ يَسْتَنْشِقُ ثَلَاثًا
فِى كُلِّ مَرَّةٍ يَسْتَنْثِرُ [He used to snuff up water
three times, every time ejecting it; &c.] and this
indicates that ↓ استنثر differs from استنشق. (T,
Mgh, Msb.) And it is said in a trad., إِذَا
اسْتَنْشَقْتَ فَانْثُرْ, (S, Msb,) and فَانْثِرْ, with the
conjunctive ا, and with damm and kesr to the ث,
(Msb,) When thou snuffest up water, scatter what is
in thy nose by the breath; (S;) or eject what is in
thy nose, of mucus, &c.: (Msb:) or, as A'Obeyd
relates it, ↓ فَأَنْثِرْ; inf. n. إِنْثَارٌ: (Msb:) or, as
he relates it إِذَا تَوَضَّاتَ فَأَنْثِرْ, with the disjunctive
ا; and he does not explain it; but the lexicologists do not allow ↓ أَنْثَرَ, from الإِنْثَارُ; one only
says, نَثَرَ and ↓ انتثر and ↓ استنثر. (T.) No
instance of ↓ استنثر used transitively has been
heard, except in a trad. of El-Hasan Ibn-'Alee,
أَنْفَهُ ↓ اِسْتَنْثَرَ [He ejected the contents of his nose;
or he blew his nose]; as though the root [نَثَرَ]
were regarded in it, or as though it were made to
import the meaning of نَقَّى. (Mgh.)
