↓ نِفْطَةٌ; (K;) and the lawyers call it ↓ نَفَّاطَةٌ,

termed كُحَيْل: (ISd, TA:) or, accord. to AHn,

in the bottom of a well, with which fire is kindled:
(TA:) the best is the white: it is a dissolvent;
and opens obstructions; removes the colic; and

signifies the same; and so ↓ مَنْفُوطَةٌ; (K;) of
which last, however, ISd says, it is thus related
by the lexicologists; but there is no way of
accounting for it in my opinion; for it is from

signifying A hand affected with pustules; on the
authority of Meyd; and it is agreeable with
analogy.]
