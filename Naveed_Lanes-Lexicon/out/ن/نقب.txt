seems, found مُحِيطَةٌ written in the place of
مُحِيطَةٌ:]) without a نَيْفَق which is the part
turned down at the top, and sewed, through which
the waistband passes], (S, K,) tied as trousers, or
drawers, are tied: (S:) or a pair of trousers, or
drawers, having a waistband, but without a part
turned down at the top, and sewed, for the waistband to pass through: if it have this, (i. e, a. نيفق,)
it is called سَراوِيلُ: (TA;) or a piece of rag of

that is upon [or covers] the soft, or pliable, part
of the nose; (AZ;) [not extending higher:] a
woman's veil that extends as high as the circuit
of the eye: (Msb:) it is of different modes: Fr
says, When a woman lowers her نقاب to her eye,
it [the action] is termed وَصْوَصَةٌ; and when she
lowers it further, to [the lower part of] the circuit
of the eye, it [the veil] is called نقاب; and if it is
on the extremity of the nose, it is [properly]
called لِفَامٌ: (T:) the نقاب, with the Arabs, is
that [kind of veil] from out of which appears the
circuit of the eye: and the meaning of the saying
in a trad. النِّقَابُ مُحْدَثٌ is, that women's shewing
the circuits of the eyes is an innovation; not that
they used not to veil their faces: the [kind of]
نقاب which they used reached close to the eye,
and they showed one eye while the other was
concealed; whereas the [kind of] نقاب, which
only shows both the eyes [without their circuits]
was called by them وَصْوَصَةٌ [a mistake for وَصْوَاصٌ]
and تُرْقُعٌ: [in the original, والنقاب لا يبدومنه الّا
العينان وكان اسمه الخ: but the و before كان is
erroneously introduced, and perverts the sense,
which is otherwise plain, and agreeable with what
is said before:] then they innovated the [veil]
properly called] نقاب: (A'Obeyd:) pl. نَقُبٌ.
(Msb.)
-A2-  نِقَابٌ and ↓ مِنَقَبٌ A road through a
rugged tract of ground: (K:) the former word

them much; who is intelligent, and enters deeply
into things. (TA.)
-A4-  نقَابٌ The bello, Hence
the proverb, فَرْخَانِ فِى نِقَابٍ [Two young birds in
one belly]: applied to two things that resemble
one another, (K.) In like manner one says
كَانَا فِى نقاب وَاحد [They were in one belly];
meaning they were like each other, (A.)
نَقِيبٌ i. q. مَنْقُوبٌ, A thing perforated, pierced,
bored. or having a hole made through, or in. or
into it. (TA.) ―

man performs this operation on his dog, in order
that guests may not hear its cry. (S: and the
like is said in the L.)
-A2-  نَقِيبُ قُوْمٍ The intendant,
superintendent, overseer, or inspector, of a people;
he who takes notice, or cognisance, of their actions,
and is responsible for them; i. q. عَرِيفُهُمْ and
شَاهِدُهُمْ and ضَمِيُهُمْ: (S, K:) like أَمِينٌ and
كَفِيلٌ: (Zj:) their head, or chief: (TA:) like
عَرِيفٌ [q. v.]; i. e., one who is set over a people,
and investigates their affairs: (L:) or, as some
say, the greatest, or supreme, chief of a people:
so called [from نَقَبَ “ he scrutinized, or investigated,”] because he is acquainted with the secret
affairs of the people, and knows their virtues, or
generous actions, and is the way by which one
obtains knowledge of their affairs: (TA:) pl.
نُقَبَاءُ. (S.)
نِقَابَةٌ The office of نَقِيب. (Sb: see 1.)
نَقِيبَةٌ Mind: syn. نَفْسٌ. (S, K,) You say
فُلَانٌ مَيْمُونُ النقيبةِ Such a one is of a fortunate
mind, (A'Obeyd, S,) when the person referred to
is fortunate in his affairs, succeeding in what he
seeks after, or strives to accomplish: (ISk, S:)
or when he is fortunate in his counsel, or advice:
(Th, S:) or the phrase signifies such a one is fortunate in his actions, and in gaining what he seeks.
(TA.) See also what follows. نَقِيبَةٌ is also said,
in the K, to signify the same as عَقْلٌ (understanding, intellect, or intelligence); but, says SM,
I have not found this in any other lexicon: only
I have found the word explained in the L as
signifying يُمْنُ الفِعْلِ (good fortune attending, or
resulting from, an action): so probably عَقْلٌ is a
mistake for فِعْلٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also, Counsel, or
advice. (K.) See above. ―
-b3-  Also, Penetration
of judgment; acuteness; sagacity. (Ibn-Buzurj,
K.) ―

disposition, temper, or other quality: (K:) i. q.
نَقِيمَةٌ and عَرِيكَةٌ and طَبِيعَةٌ. (T, art. عرك.)
Agreeably with this explanation, the phrase above
mentioned is rendered in the T, in art. عرك, Such
a one is of a fortunate nature, or natural disposition: (TA:) or it signifies, in this phrase, as
also نقيمة, i. q. لَوْنٌ, Colour, complexion, species,
&c. (IAar.) Also هُوَ حَسَنُ النَّقِيبَةِ He is of a
good nature, or natural disposition: and in like
manner, جَمِيلَةٍ ↓ فُلَانٌ فِى مَنَاقِبَ Such a one is a
person of good dispositions, or natural qualities.
(L.)
-A2-  نَقِيبَةٌ A she-camel having a large udder:
(ISd, K:) having her udder bound up with a
cloth or the like, on account of its greatness and
excellence: but AM says this is a corruption, and
that the correct word is ثقيبة, with ث, meaning
a she-camel “ abounding with milk. ” (TA.)

نَاقِب and نَاقِبَةٌ [the former omitted in some

أَنْقَابٌ, a pl. without a sing., The ears: (M,

كَانَتْ خُدُودُ هِجَانِهِنَّ مُمَالَةً
أَنْقَابُهُنَّ إِلَى حُدَآءِ السُّوَّقِ
[The cheeks of their white camels were with their
ears inclined to the singing of the drivers]. But
أَنَقًا بِهِنَّ, “by reason of their pleasure,” is also
read, for أَنْقَابُهُنَّ: (TA:) [so that the meaning is
The cheeks of their white camels were inclined, by
reason of their pleasure. to the singing of the
drivers].
مَنْقَبٌ The navel: or [a place] before it: (K:)
where the farrier makes a perforation in order
that a yellow fluid may issue forth: (S:) so in a
horse. (TA.) ―
-b2-  See نَقْبٌ.

-b2-  A narrow way between
two houses, (L, K,) along which one cannot pass.
(L.) It is said in a trad., that one does not
possess the right of pre-emption (الشُّفْعَة) with

as signifying a wall: syn. حَائِطٌ: [and so in the
K:] or a way between two houses, as though it
were perforated from one to the other: or a road,
or way, over an elevated piece of ground. (L.)
