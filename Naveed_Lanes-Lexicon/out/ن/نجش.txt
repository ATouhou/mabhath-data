نَجُشَ, (S, Msb,) inf. n. نَجْشٌ, (S,
Msb, K,) He concealed himself. (Msb.)
-A2-
[And hence, He pursued game, or objects of the
chase: (see نَاجِشٌ:) or] he roused game, or
objects of the chase, (S, Mgh, K,) and scared
them from place to place. (TA.) You say also,
نَجَشُوا عَلَيْهِ الصَّيْدَ, meaning, They scared the chase,
or game, towards him, and drove and collected it to
him. (TA.) ―
-b2-  He searched after a thing, and
roused it. (Sh, A'Obeyd, K.) This, accord. to
Sh, is the primary signification: [but accord. to
Fei, the primary signification is the first given
above:] and hence the saying in a trad., لَا تَطْلُعُ
الشَّمْسُ حَتَّى تَنْجُسُهَا ثَلٰثُمِائَةٍ وَسِتُّونَ مَلَكًا The sun
does not rise until three hundred and sixty angels

نَجُشَ,
(Msb, TA,) inf. n. نَجْشٌ (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K)
and نَجَشٌ, [which is the form generally used by
the professors of practical law,] (ISh, Mgh, Sgh,
TA,) or this is a simple subst., (Msb,) He
demanded the sale of an article of merchandise for
more than its price, (A, Mgh, Msb,) not meaning
to purchase it, (Mgh, Msb,) in order that another
might see him and fall into the snare thus laid for
him: and in like manner it is used with respect to
marriage, [i. e., with respect to dowers,] and other
things: (A, Mgh, Msb:) and the doing thus is
forbidden: (Mgh:) it is from نَجَشَ signifying
“ he roused ” game: (Mgh:) or from the same
verb signifying “ he concealed himself; ” because
he who does so conceals his intention: (Msb:) or
he augmented the price of an article of merchandise, not desiring to purchase it, but in order that
another might hear him and augment in the same
manner: (A'Obeyd, L:) or he outbade in a sale,
in order that another might fall into a snare, he
himself not wanting the thing: (S:) or he augmented the price of an article of merchandise, or
praised it, in order that another might see that,
and be deceived by him: (Ibráheem El-Harbee:)
or he praised an article of merchandise belonging
to another in order that he might sell it, or dispraised it in order that it might not be easy for
him to sell it: (ISh:) or he concurred with a
man desiring to sell a thing, by praising him:
(Abu-l-Khattáb, K:) or he bargained with a man
desiring to sell a thing, offering him a large price,
in order that another might see him and fall into
a snare: or he scared people from one thing to
another: (K:) also, he praised a thing; or
praised it exceedingly, or for that which was not
in it, or excessively and falsely; syn. مَدَحَ شَيْئًا and
أَطْرَاهُ: and he invented, or forged, a lie. (TA.)
It is said in a trad., (S,) ↓ لَا تَنَاجَشُوا, (S, Mgh,
Msb,) i. e., Ye shall not practise نَجْش, or نَجَش:
(Mgh, Msb:) or ↓ تَنَاجُشٌ signifies the bidding one
against another, successively increasing their offers,
in a sale, or other case; (K;) for it sometimes signifies the doing so in the case of a dowry, in order
that the doing so may be heard, and the amount may
consequently be augmented: (TA:) and Sh mentions, with respect to ↓ تَنَاجُشٌ, on the authority
of Aboo-Sa'eed, another thing, which is allowable, namely, [that it signifies the conspiring to
promote the marriage of] the woman who has
been married and divorced time after time; and
[the sale of] the article of merchandise that has
been bought time after time and then sold. (TA.)
