syn. عُرَابٌ. In a prayer of David occur the
words يَا رَازِق النَّعَّابِ فِى عُشِّهِ [O Sustainer of the
young raven (or young crow) in his nest!]. It is
said that the young raven (or young crow), when
it comes forth from its egg, is white, like a lump
of fat, and that the old bird, on seeing it, dislikes
and abandons it; that thereupon God sends to it
gnats, which light upon it on account of its foul
greasy smell, and that it lives upon them until it
is fledged and becomes black, when its parents
return to it. (L.)
