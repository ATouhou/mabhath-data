the [kind of serpent called] ثُعْبَان: (IKt. ElFárábee, S, M, Msb, K:) the keeper of vines or
palm-trees or seed-produce (النَّاظِرٌ) takes it for his
use, when he is in vehement fear of serpents of the
kind above mentioned: for it attacks them, making
itself thin and slender as though it were a piece
of rope; and when it winds itself upon them, they

نَامُوسٍ, and نَوَامِيسَ, Such a one is a person of

an evil nature. (TA.) [The author of the Mgh
thinks that the second of the significations mentioned above, i. e. “ revelation,” is derived from
this; a prefixed noun [such as كِتَاب, perhaps,]
being understood.] Hence, (Mgh,) النّامُوسُ,
(A'Obeyd, S, M, Msb, K,) or النَّامُوسُ الأَكْبَرُ,
(A, TA,) is applied to [The angel] Gabriel;
(A'Obeyd, S, M, A, &c.) by the people of the
