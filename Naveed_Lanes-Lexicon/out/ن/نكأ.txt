نَكَأَ القَرْحَةَ. (S, K,) inf. n. نَكْءٌ, (S,) He
peeled off the scab from the sore (S, K,) before it
was healed, and it became moist in consequence.
(K.) [See also نَكَى.]
-A2-  نَكَأَ العَدُوَّ, and فِى
العَدُوِّ, dial. form of نَكَى [q. v.] (K.) By some
rejected. (TA)
-A3-  نَكَأَهُ حَقَّهُ (like رَكَأهُ, TA),
inf. n. نَكْءٌ, He paid him his due. (K.) ―
-b2-
هُنِّئتَ وَلَا تُنْكأْ, (S,) and تُنْكَ, (TA,) and تُنْكهُ (S,
for تُنْكَ or تُنْكأْ, TA), Mayest thou be made to
have enjoyment in that which thou hast received,
and not experience pain! (S) Mayest thou gain
what is good, and may harm not befall thee!
(T:) or, with the latter of the two verbs without
نَكُاَ (تنك), may God not make thee discomfited
(AHeyth, L.) [Accord. to AHeyth. as mentioned in the TA, the latter verb in this proverb
is written تَنْكَهْ and تُنْكَهْ; but the right reading is
doubtless تُنْكَ and تُنْكَهْ: this is shown by the explanation there following.]
