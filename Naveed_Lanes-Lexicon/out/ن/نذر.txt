نذر1
نَذَرَ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ, (Yoo, Akh, T, S, M, A, *
K,) aor.
نَذِرَ and
نَذُرَ, (M, K,) inf. n. نَذْرٌ (Yoo, Akh,
S, M, K,) and نُذُورٌ, (M, K,) [He made a vow;
imposed upon himself a vow; أَنْ يَفْعَلَ كَذَا that
he would do such a thing; either absolutely, or
conditionally, as will be explained below;] he
made [a future action] binding, or obligatory, on
himself; (T, M, A, K;) as also ↓ انتذر. (K.)
And نَذْرًا ↓ انتذر signifies the same as نَذَرَ [He
vowed a vow]. (Sgh.) You say also نَذَرْتُ مَالِى,
aor.
نَذُرَ [and
نَذِرَ as implied in the K] inf. n. نَذْرٌ, [I
vowed my property; made a vow to give it.]
(Yoo, Akh, S, K. *) And نَذَرْتُ لِلّٰهِ كَذَا, (S,
Msb, K,) aor.
نَذُرَ and
نَذِرَ, (S, Msb,) inf. n. نَذْرٌ,
(Msb,) I made it binding, or obligatory, on myself, [i. e., I vowed,] of my own free will, to do or
to give such a thing to God; namely, some religious service, or an alms, &c.: (TA:) or نَذْرٌ
signifies the promising conditionally; as when one
says, “Such a thing shall be obligatory on me if
God restore to health my sick [son or other]: ”
this is termed نَذْرٌ: but the saying “ I impose
upon myself the giving a deenár as alms,” is not
so termed. (K.) The doing this is repeatedly
forbidden in traditions: but what is meant thereby is, one's doing so in the belief that he may
attain by it something which God has not decreed
to betide him, or that he may divert from himself
something decreed to befall him: yet if he do so,
fulfilment is obligatory on him. (IAth.) You
say also, نَذَرَ الوَلَدَ, (M, K,) and نَذَرَتْهُ, (M,) He
(the father, M, K) and she (the mother, M) appointed the child [by a vow] to be a minister or
servant to the church, (M, K,) or to a place
appropriated to religious services or exercises, or
acts of devotion: (TA:) so in the Kur, iii. 31.
(M.)
-A2-  نَذِرَ بِالشَّىْءِ, aor.
نَذَرَ, (M, IKtt, Msb, K,)
inf. n. نَذَرٌ (M, IKtt) and نَذَارَةٌ and نِذَارَةٌ, (IKtt,)
or, as some assert, it has no inf. n., like عَسَى &c.,
the Arabs being content to use in its stead أَنْ
followed by the verb, as is said in the 'Ináyeh,
on the Kur, chap. xiv., (MF,) He knew of the
thing: (Msb:) or he knew of the thing and was
cautious of it or on his guard against it or in fear
of it. (M, K.) You say also نَذِرَ القَوْمُ بالعَدُوِّ
(S, A) The people knew of the enemy: (S:) or
knew of the enemy and prepared themselves for
them: (A:) or knew of the enemy and were
cautious of them or on their guard against them
or in fear of them. (TA.) And it is said in a
trad., إِنْذَرِ القَوْمَ Have thou knowledge of the
people and be cautious of them or on thy guard
against them or in fear of them. (TA.)
4
أَنْذَرْتُهُ بِالأَمْرِ, (M, K,) and انذرته الشَّىْءَ,
(Msb,) inf. n. إِنْذَارٌ (T, S, M, Msb, K) and نُذْرٌ
(M, K) the latter accord. to Kr, but correctly it
is a simple subst., (M,) and نُذُرٌ, (T, K,) or this is
pl. of نَذِيرٌ, (T,) and نَذْرٌ, (K,) accord. to Lh
and Kr, (TA,) [but this is properly a simple
subst.,] and نَذِيرٌ, (M, K,) accord. to Zj, (M,)
or Ez-Zejjájee, (TA,) but this should rather be
regarded as a simple subst., (T, M,) I informed
him, or advised him, of the thing: (M, K, TA:)
this is the primary signification: (TA:) and [I
warned him of the thing;] I cautioned him, or
put him on his guard, against the thing, and put
him in fear, (M, * K,) in my communication or
announcement: (K:) in this sense the verb is
used in the Kur, xl. 18: (M, TA:) or I announced to him the thing, (S, * Msb,) generally in
a case of putting in fear the person addressed, or
frightening him, (Msb,) or never otherwise than
in such a case: (S:) and thus the verb is used
in the Kur, ubi supra., وَأَنْذرْهُم يَوْمَ آلازِفَةِ [And
warn them and put them in fear of the day of
the approaching event, the day of resurrection]
meaning, put them in fear of its punishment:
(Msb:) and أَنْذَزْتُهُ بِكَذَا I informed him, or
advised him, of such a thing. (Msb.) انذرهُ
also signifies He (a spy) informed him, or
advised him, of the state of the enemy: in the
copies of the K, نَذَرَهُ; but this is a mistake.
(TA.) And you say, أَنْذَرْتُ القَوْمَ مَسِيرَ العَدُرِّ
إِلَيْهِمْ I informed the people of the march of the
enemy towards them, to put them on their guard.
(T.) And أَنْذَرْتُ القَوْمَ بِالعَدُوِّ, and أَنْذَرْتُهُمُ العَدُوَّ,
signify the same. (A.) It is said in a proverb,
قَدْ أَعْذَرَ مَنْ أَنْذَرَ, meaning, He hath become
excused, and averted from himself the blame of
men, who hath warned thee that he will punish
thee for a future evil deed proceeding from thee,
if thou then do the evil deed and he punish
thee. (T.) See also أَعْذَرَ, in two places: and
see عُذْرٌ.
6
تناذر القَوْمُ The people warned, or cautioned,
one another, or put one another in fear, (M, K,)
of a terrifying evil. (TA.) You say تناذر القَوْمُ
كَذَا The people warned one another, (S,) and
put one another in fear, of such a thing. (S, A.)
A poet says, (S,) namely, En-Nábighah, (T,
TA,) describing a serpent, (T,) and his being
threatened by En-Noamán so that he passed the
night as though he had been stung, turning over
and over upon his bed, (TA,)
تَنَاذَرَهَا الرَّاقُونَ مِنْ سُوْءِ سَمِّهَا
تُطَلِّقُهُ طَوْرًا وَطَوْرًا تُرَاجِعُ
[Of which the charmers have warned one another,
and put one another in fear, on account of the
evil nature of its poison, which it discharges one
time and one time draws back]. (T, S, TA.)
8
إِنْتَذَرَ see نَذَرَ, in two places.
10
استنذر إِلَيْهِ He offered warning to him
(A, TA, art. عذر.) See استعذر.
نَذْرٌ A vow, which a man makes to be binding,
or obligatory, on himself; (T, M, * K, * TA;)
[either absolutely, or conditionally: (see نَذَرَ:)]
pl. نُذُورٌ: (S, M, K: *) and in the following
verse of Ibn-Ahmar, some say that نُذُر is pl. of
نَذْرٌ, like as رُهُنٌ is pl. of رَهْنٌ; but others say
that it is pl. of نَذِيرٌ in the sense of مَنْذُورٌ:
كَمْ دُونَ لَيْلَى مِنْ تَنُوفِيَّةٍ
لَمَّاعَةٍ تُنْذَرُ فِيهَا النُّذُرْ
[How many a waterless desert glistening with
the mirage, in which vows, or things vowed,
are vowed, lie in the way to Leylà!]. (S.) ―
-b2-
Also, (tropical:)  The mulct for an intentional wound;
used in this sense by Esh-Sháfi'ee, (T, TA,)
and of the dial. of El-Hijáz; (TA;) i. q. أَرْشٌ,
(T, A, K, TA,) which is of the dial. of the
people of El-'Irák: (T, TA:) pl. نُذُورٌ: (T, A,
K:) said by Aboo-Nahshal to be only for
wounds, small and great. (T, K. *) You say,
لِى قِبَلَ فُلَانٍ نَذْرٌ, (T, TS, L,) or عِنْدَ فُلَانٍ,
(K,) (tropical:)  A mulct for a wound is owed to me.
(T, K, &c.) And أَعْطَيْتُهُ نَذْرَ جُرْحِهِ (tropical:)  I gave
him the mulct for his wound. (A.) Aboo-Sa'eed
Ed-Dareer says that it is thus called لِأَنَّهُ نُذِرَ فِيهِ,
i. e., because it is made binding, or obligatory,
for it; [namely, for the wound;] from the
phrase نَذَرْتُ علَى نَفْسِى. (T, TA.) ―
-b3-  [A
votive offering].
-A2-  See also نُذْرٌ.
نُذْرٌ (M) and ↓ نُذُرٌ (T, S, K) [and ↓ نَذْرٌ
(see 4)] and ↓ نَذِيرٌ (S, M) and ↓ نَذِيرَةٌ (M)
and ↓ نِذَارَةٌ (Esh-Sháfi'ee, K) and ↓ نُذْرَى (K)
are substs. in the sense of إِنْذَارٌ [meaning An
informing, or advising, of a thing: and a warning, or cautioning, and putting one on his guard,
against a thing, and putting one in fear of a
thing; &c.: (see 4:)] (T, S, M, K:) or a putting
one in fear in announcing a thing. (TA.) عُذْرًا
أَوْ نُذْرًا and عُذُرًا أَوْ نُذُرًا, accord. to different
readings, in the Kur, lxxvii. 6, put in the
accus. case as causal complements, signify لِلْإِعْذَارِ
وَالْإِنْذَارِ [For excusing and warning]. (Zj, T.)
[See also art. عذر.] And in like manner, ↓ نُذُرِ,
in the Kur, liv. 16, &c., signifies إِنْذَارِى. (S, K.)
And so ↓ نَذِيرِ, in the Kur, lxvii. 17. (T, M.)
Hence also the saying of the Arabs, عُذْرَاكَ لَا
نُذْرَاكَ, meaning, أَعْذِرُ وَلَا تُنْذِرْ [i. e. Do thou
that for which thou wilt be excused, by inflicting
punishment when it is deserved, and do not merely
warn and put in fear]. (TA.)

come upon them; (TA;) a spy who gives notice,
to a people, of an enemy, to put them on their

(T, K:) نَذِيرٌ is of the measure فَعِيلٌ in the sense
of the measure مُفْعِلٌ: (M, L:) or its verb was
نَذَرَ, but this has become obsolete: (T:) its pl.
is نُذُرٌ; (M, Msb, K;) occurring in the Kur,
liv. 23, [&c.]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] ابو مُنْذِرٍ The
cock (Har. p. 644). ―
-b3-  [And also,] النَّذِيرُ The
apostle: (M, K:) so in the Kur, xxxv. 34,
accord. to Th: (M:) the prophet Mohammad:

that verse of the Kur. (T.) ―
-b4-  Hoariness, or
whiteness of the hair: (T, M, K:) so, accord.
to some, in the verse of the Kur, last referred
to: (T, M:) but the explanation immediately
preceding is more probable. (T.) ―
