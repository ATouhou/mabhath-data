نقر1
نَقَرَ, (S, A, Msb, K,) aor.
نَقُرَ, inf. n. نَقْرٌ, (S,
Msb,) He (a bird) pecked, or picked up, (S, A,
Msb, K,) a grain, (S,) or grains, (A, Msb,) from
this place and that, (A, K,) بِمِنْقَارِهِ with his beak.
(A.) [Accord. to the TA, the addition “ from
this place and that,” which is found in the K and
A, and in one place in the S, seems to be unnecessary. And ↓ انتقر signifies the same: see 8,
in art. قب.] ―
-b2-  [Hence, because of the sure aim
with which a bird pecks a thing,] the same verb,
having the same [aor. and] inf. n. signifies, (tropical:)  It
(an arrow) hit the butt. (Msb.) And He (an
archer) hit the butt, without making his arrow to
pass through, partly or wholly. (TA.) ―
-b3-  [Hence
also,] (assumed tropical:)  He took [or picked] a thing, as, for
instance, food, with the finger. (TA.) ―
-b4-  Also,
(M, K,) aor. and inf. n. as above, (M, TA,) He
struck a thing (IKtt, K, * TA,) with a thing:
(IKtt, TA:) [generally, he struck, knocked, or
pecked, a thing with a pointed instrument, like as
a bird strikes a thing with its beak:] he struck
[or pecked] a mill-stone, or a stone, &c., with a
مِنْقَار [which is a pick, or a kind of pickaxe; i. e.,
he wrought it into shape, and roughened it in its
surface, with a pick]. (M, TA.) ―
-b5-  [Hence,]
(tropical:)  He wrote [or engraved writing] فِى حَجَرٍ upon
a stone. (A, K.) Whence the saying, التَّعْلِيمُ
فِى الصِّغَرِ كَالنَّقْرِ عَلَى الحَجَرِ [or, as in a verse of
Niftaweyh, فِى الحَجَرِ, i. e., Teaching in infancy
is like engraving writing upon stone]. (TA.) ―
-b6-
He struck [or fillipped] a man's head, and in like
manner a lute, and a tambourine, with his finger.
(TA.) You say also أُذُنَهُ ↓ أَنْقَرَ, meaning, He
struck [or fillipped] his ear with his finger. (AA,
in TA, art. نطب.) ―
-b7-  [Hence,] نَقَرَ, [aor.
نَقُرَ, inf.
n. نَقْرٌ, as appears from what follows;] and ↓ أَنْقَرَ;
(tropical:)  [He made a snapping with his thumb and middle
finger;] he struck his thumb against the end of
the middle finger and made a sound with them.
(A.) [And in like manner the former verb used
transitively; as in the following instance:] وَضَعَ
طَرَفَ إِبْهَامِهِ عَلَى بَاطِنِ سَبَّابَتِهِ ثُمَّ نَقَرَهَا [(tropical:)  He put
the end of his thumb against the inner side of his
first finger, then made a snapping with it]. (TA.)
See also نَقْرٌ, below. ―
-b8-  [Hence also,] نَقَرَ بِالدَّابَّةِ,
(T, A, TS,) or بِالفَرَسِ, (S,) aor.
نَقُرَ, (TA,) inf. n.
نَقْرٌ; (T, S, TS;) and ↓ أَنْقَرَ, (A, TS,) inf. n. إِنْقَارٌ;
(TS;) (tropical:)  He made a [smacking or] slight sound, to
put in motion the [beast or] horse, by making his
tongue adhere to his palate and then opening [or
suddenly drawing it away]: (S:) or he struck
with his tongue the place of utterance of the letter
ن and made a [smacking] sound [by suddenly
withdrawing his tongue]: (A:) نَقْرٌ signifies the
making the end of the tongue to adhere to the
palate, then making a sound [by suddenly withdrawing it]: (M, K:) or one's putting his tongue
above his central incisors, at the part next the
palate, then making a smacking sound [so I
render ثُمَّ يَنْقُر]: (TA:) [the sounds thus described,
which are nearly the same, are commonly made
by the Arabs in the present day, in urging beasts
of carriage:] or an agitation of the tongue (K,
TA) in the mouth, upwards and downwards:
(TA:) or a sound, (so in some copies of the K
and in the TA,) or slight sound, (so in the TS [as
mentioned in the TA] and in some copies of the
K) by which a horse is put in motion: (TS, K:)
or نَقَرَ بِلِسَانِهِ, accord. to IKtt, signifies he struck
his palate with his tongue to quiet the horse: but
this is at variance with what is said by Az, J, and
ISd, and requires consideration. (TA.) A poet,
(S,) Fedekee El-Minkaree, (K,) i. e., 'Obeyd
Ibn-Máweeyeh, of the tribe of Teiyi, (TA,) uses
النَّقُرْ for النَّقْرْ, meaning النَّقْرُ بِالْخَيْلِ [The smacking
with the tongue to urge the horses]: pausing after
the word, at the end of a hemistich, he transfers
the vowel of the ر to the ق, (S, K,) agreeably
with the dial. of certain of the Arabs, (TA,) that
the hearer may know it to be the vowel of the
[final] letter when there is no pause; (S;) like
as you say, هٰذَا بَكْرُ and مَرَرْتُ بِبَكِرْ: but this is
not done when the word is in the accus. case
(S, K:) and if you choose, you may make the
final letter quiescent in pausing, though it is preceded by a quiescent letter. (S.) ―
-b9-  Hence also,
فَإِذَا نُقِرَ فِى النَّاقُورِ [Kur, lxxiv. 8,] (tropical:)  For when the
horn shall be blown: (S, * A, * Bd, K:) from نَقْرٌ
signifying (tropical:)  the making a sound: originally,
striking, which is the cause of sound. (Bd.)
See also نَاقُورٌ, below. ―
-b10-  Also, نَقَرَ He bored,
perforated, or made a hole through or in or into,
a thing: (TA:) or he did so with a مِنْقَار: (S:)
and, inf. n. نَقْرٌ, he hollowed out, or excavated, a
piece of wood. (Mgh, Msb.) نُقِرٌ and ↓ اِنْتَقَرَ,
(so in some copies of the K,) or ↓ أُنْتُقِرَ, (so in
other copies of the K and in the TA,) both in the
pass. form, (TA,) said of stone and of wood and
the like, signify alike, (K,) It was bored, or perforated, or it had a hole made through or in or
into it: (TA:) [and it was hollowed out.] You
say, نَقَرَ البَيْضَةَ عَنِ الفَرْخِ, (K,) aor.
نَقُرَ, inf. n. نَقْرٌ,
(TA.) He made a hole in the egg [so as to disclose
the young bird]. (K.) And نَقَرَت الخَيْلُ,
(A,) and بحوافرها نُقَرًا ↓ انتقرت, (Lth, K,) The
horses made hollows in the ground with their hoofs.
(Lth, A, K.) And in like manner, ↓ انتقرت
السُّيُولُ نُقَرًا The torrents left hollows in the ground,
in which water was retained. (TA.) ―
-b11-  Hence,
نَقَرَ عَنِ الأَمْرِ; (Msb;) and عَنْهُ ↓ نقّر, (S, K,)
inf. n. تَنْقِيرٌ; (S;) and ↓ نقّرهُ; and ↓ تنقّرهُ: and
↓ انتقرهُ; (K;) (tropical:)  He searched or inquired into the
thing; investigated, scrutinized, or examined, it;
(S, Msb, K, TA;) and endeavoured to know it:
(TA;) and so نَقَرَ عَنِ لخَبَرِ (tropical:)  he investigated the
news, and endeavoured to know it. (A.) [And
hence,] السَّهْمَ بَيْنَ إِصْبَعَيْهِ ↓ نقّر. (K, in art. حن,)
or عَلَى الإِبْهَامِ, inf. n. تَنْقِيرٌ, (K, in art. دوم,) [He
tried the sonorific quality of the arrow by turning
it round between his fingers, or upon his thumb:
see حَنَّانٌ, and دَرَّ السَّهْمُ, and see also 4, in art. دوم:
or] نقّر السَّهْمَ signifies he made the arrow to produce a sharp sound [by turning it round between
his fingers, or] upon his thumb. (TK, in art. دوم.)

نَقَّرَ see 1, last two sentences.
4
أَنْقَرَ see 1, in three places, in the first half.
-A2-
انقر عَنْهُ, (S, K,) inf. n. إِنْفَارٌ, (TA,) He refrained,
forbore, abstained, or desisted, from it or him;
he left or relinquished, it or him. (S, * K.) Hence
the saying, ضَرَبَهُ فَمَا أَنْقَرَ عَنْهُ حَتَّى قَتَلَهُ He beat
him and left him not until be killed him. (TA.)
And hence the saying of I'Ab, مَاكَانَ اللّٰهُ لِيُنْقِرَ
عَنْ قَاتِلِ الْمُؤْمِنِ, i. e., God will not leave the
slayer of the believer until He destroy him (S,
TA.)

نَقْرٌ (tropical:)  A slight sound that is heard in consequence
of striking the thumb against the middle finger
[and then letting them fly apart in opposite
directions, passing each other]: (S, K:) [or the
snapping with the fingers or with the thumb and
middle finger, or with the thumb and first finger;
as also ↓ نَقيرٌ: n. an. of the former with ة.] One
says, مَا أَثَابَهُ نَقْرَةٌ (tropical:)  [He did not reward him with
even a snap of the fingers;] meaning, with anything: (S, K [in the former of which it is implied
that نقرة thus used is from نَقْرٌ in the first of the
senses explained above;]) not used thus save in
[a negative phrase. (S.) A poet says,
وَهُنّ حَرَى أَلَّا يُثِبْنَكَ نقْرَةٌ
وَأَنْتَ حَرُى بِالنَّار حِينَ تُثِيبُ
(tropical:)  [And they are fit, or worthy, not to reward thee
with anything, and thou art fit for, or worthy
of, the fire of hell when thou rewardest]. (S.)
Or the right reading in both these instances is
↓ نُقْرَةً, with damm. (TA.) [See نُقْرَةٌ.] One
says also, لَمْ يَكْتَرِتْ لِى بِقَدُر نَقْرَة إِصْبَعٍ (tropical:)  [He
did not care for me so much as a snap of a
finger]. (A.) [See also an (??) in a verse cited
in the first paragraph of art. شأو.] I'Ab, in
explanation of the words of the Kur, [iv. 123,]
وَلَا يُظْلَمُونَ نَقِيرًا, put the end of the thumb
against the inner side of his first finger, then
made a snapping with it (ثُمَّ نَقَرَهَا), and said,
This is what is termed ↓ نَقِيرٌ; [denoting the lit.
meaning to be (tropical:)  And they shall not be wronged a
snap of the fingers.] (TA.) But see نُقْرَةٌ,
below. ―
-b2-  Also, A sound, or slight sound, by
which a horse is put in motion: (TS, K:) as
also ↓ نَقِيرٌ: (TA:) or the former has one or

نَقَرَ بِالدَّابَّةِ. (K, &c.)
نِقْرٌ: see نُقْرَةٌ.

back of the neck; (TA;) what is called نُقْرَةُ
القَفَا; (S, A, Msb;) i. e., the hollow where (??)
brain ends: the cupping in that part occasions
forgetfulness: (Msb.) [and any similar hollow
as the pit of the stomach: and a dimple:
accord. to present usage; and in this sense it is
used in the A, K, and TA, voce فَحْصَةٌ ―
-b3-  The
cavity, or socket, of the eye. (K.) ―
-b4-  Foramen
and; syn. ثَقْبُ الاِسْتِ: (K:) but in the (??)
it is said that نُقْرَةُ الوَرِكِ signifies the hole, or
perforation, that is the middle of the haunch;
[app. meaning the sacro-ischiatic foramen: see
الفَائِلُ, in art. فيل: but perhaps it may sometimes
mean the socket of the thigh-bone; for نُقْرةٌ
signifies any socket of a bone.] (TA.) ―
-b5-  The
little spot [or embryo] upon the back of a date
stone, (AHeyth, K,) which is as though it were
hollowed. (TA,) and from which the palm-tree
grows forth: (AHeyth;) as also ↓ نَقيرٌ (S, A,
Msb, K) and ↓ نِقْرٌ (K) and ↓ أُنْقُورٌ. (Sgh, K)

brother Arbad.
↓ وَلَيْسَ النَّاسُ بَعْدَكَ فِى نَقِيرٍ
lit., [And the people, after thee, are not worth]
a little spot on the back of a date-stone; meaning,
لَبْسُوا بَعْدَكَ فِى شَىْءٍ (tropical:)  [after thee they are not
worth anything]. (S.) And hence, accord. to
ISk [and the Jel], the saying in the Kur,
[iv. 123.] وَلَا يُظْلَمُونَ نَقِيرًا [And they shall not
be wronged even as to a little spot on the back of
a date-stone.] (TA.) Hence also, [in verse 56
of the same chap.,] لَا يُؤْتُونَ النَّاسَ نَقِيرًا (tropical:)  They
would not give men a thing as inconsiderable as
the little hollow in the back of a date-stone.

whereof becomes strong: (S, K:) or a stump, or
the lower part, (اصل,) of a palm-tree, which it
was a custom of the people of El-Yemámeh to
hollow out, then they crushed in it ripe dates and
unripe dates, which [with water poured upon

therein and subsided: (A 'Obeyd:) or a stump,
or the lower part, (اصل,) of a palm-tree, whereof
the middle was hollowed out, then dates were put
in them, with water, which became intoxicating
نبيذ: (IAth:) the word is of the measure فَعِيلٌ

is said in a trad., that Mohammad forbade
النَّقِير, (S, * Msb, * TA,) meaning, the نبيذ thereof.

hit the butt it is not so called: (S, TA:) [but
see a phrase following:] pl. نَوَاقِرُ. (A, Msb.)
―
-b3-  [Hence,] أَخْطَأَتْ نَوَاقِرُهُ (tropical:)  [lit., His arrows
that were wont to hit the butt missed]; meaning,
he did not continue in the right course. (TA.)
[And hence,] نَاقِرَةٌ (tropical:)  A calamity; (K, TA;)

-b4-  Also, نَاقِرَةٌ (tropical:)  A
right argument, allegation, evidence, or the like;
syn. حُجَّةٌ مُصِيبَةٌ: in the K, a و is incorrectly

pecks, or picks up, with it: (TA:) or of a bird
which is not one of prey; that of a bird of prey
being called مِنْسَرٌ: (Fs, and S in art. نسر,
and MF:) therefore the explanation in the K,
which is, the مِنْسَر of a bird, is incorrect: (MF:)

كَأَرْحَآءِ رَقْدٍ زَلَّمَتْهَا المَنَاقِرُ
[Like mill-stones of Rakd (a mountain so called)
which the minkars have rounded]. (TA.) See
زَلَّمَ.
مُنْتَقَرُ العَيْنِ, or مُنْتَقِرُهَا: see مُنَقَّر.
