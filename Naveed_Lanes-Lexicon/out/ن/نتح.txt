from the skin, (L, K,) or from the roots of the

―
-b8-  نَتَحَهُ It (heat, L, K, and some other thing,
L,) made him to sweat. (L, K.) [Its aor.
seems to be يَنْتَحُ; and MF thinks that, in an
instance which follows, it may be written with ا
after the ت by poetic licence.] F observes, that
J has fallen into three errors with respect to
اِنْتَاحَ; [saying that الاِنْتِيَاحُ (in the place of
which is put, in some copies of the S, الاِنْتِتَاحُ,
as is mentioned in the TA,) is like النَّتْحُ, and
citing these words of Dhu-r-Rummeh, describing
a camel making his voice to reciprocate in the
شِقْشِقَة,
رَقْشَآءُ تَنْتَاحُ اللُّغَامَ المُزْبِدَا
first, because the root of the present art. is sound,
so that الانتياح has no place in it; secondly,
because this word has no meaning (in this art.
TA); and thirdly, because the [correct] reading
is تَمْتَاحُ, meaning “ casts forth ” the froth of the
mouth. Neither IB nor IM has animadverted
on J in this case. MF, however, observes, that
one relation of a verse &c., does not impugn the
correctness of another relation that differs from
it; and that perhaps the ن of تنتاح is a substitute for م; such substitution being frequent;
[as in the case of إِنْتَتَحَ;] or that the ا is what
is termed أَلِفُ إِشْبَاعٍ, and added for the sake
of the metre. (TA.)
