is termed فِلْقٌ: (K, TA:) and thus is termed a

ringworm indeed overcome the spittle?]: AA says,
the meaning is, that he was in wonder at the
alteration of usual occurrences; for the spittle
usually dispels the ringworm, so he spat upon his
ringworm, but it did not become healed: القوبآء
is made an agent; and الريقة, an objective complement. (O, TA.) ―

its pl. is فُلُوقٌ, for this I think very questionable.
