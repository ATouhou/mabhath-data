[meaning (tropical:)  And they shall not be wronged by their
being deprived of the most paltry right; or they
shall not be wronged a whit]: (O, TA:) or the
[primary, or proper,] meaning in this phrase is

Bd says in iv. 52.) ―

خَيْط [or thread, meaning the filament], (Bd in
iv. 52,) that is in the شَقّ [or cleft, resembling a
crease, which extends along one side] of the datestone: (M, K, TA: but for شَقّ, the CK has
شِقّ:) ISk says, the قِطْمِير is the thin integument
upon the date-stone, and, he adds, (T, TA, *) the
فَتِيل is what is in the شَقّ of the date-stone. (T,
S, O, Msb, TA.) Hence, (M,) one says, مَا أُغْنِى
عَنْهُ فَتِيلًا, (M, and so in the K except that the
latter has عَنْكَ instead of عَنْهُ,) meaning [I do not

wicks are sometimes made. ―
-b2-  And in the present
day, فَتِيلَةٌ also signifies A hempen match. ―

فَتْلَآءُ, (T, M, K,) applied to a she-camel, meaning
having, in her arm, a wide separation from the
side: (T, * TA:) or, so applied, heavy, and curved
in the kind legs: (M, K:) [the pl. is فُتْلٌ:] and
one says قَوْمٌ فُتْلُ الأَيْدِى [app. meaning Persons
having the arms widely separated from the sides].
(S, O.)
ذُبَالٌ مُفَتَّلٌ [Twisted wicks]: the epithet in this

[or fore arm]; as though it were twisted. (TA.)
