فوص3
المُفَاوَصَةُ signifies The being clear, or perspicuous, syn. البَيَانُ, (S, O, K,) in talk or discourse (فِى الحَدِيثِ). (S. [In the O, and K,
مِنَ الحَدِيثِ; and hence it is said in the TK that
فَاوَصَ الحَدِيثَ signifies بَيَّنَهُ He made the talk, or
discourse, clear, or perspicuous: but for this I do
not find any authority.]) Some say المُفَايَصَةُ.
(IB, TA in art. فيص.) [See also 4 in art. فيص.]

مَا أَفَاصَ بِكَلِمَةِ: see art. فيص. [It seems to
be indicated in the S that this is from المُفَاوَصَةُ,
expl. above: and the like of this is app. said by
IB.]

التَّفَاوُصُ signifies التَّبَايُنُ [The being, or becoming, separated, one from another]; from البَيْنُ,
not from البَيَانُ: (O, K:) originally التَّفَايُصُ;
mentioned also [in a different sense] in art. فيص.
(TA.) See the latter art.
