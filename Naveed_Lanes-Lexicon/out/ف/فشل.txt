فشل1
فَشِلَ, (S, O, Msb, K,) aor
فَشَلَ, (O, Msb, K,)
inf. n. فَشَلٌ; (S, O, Msb;) a verb of which exs.
occur in the Kur iii. 118 and viii. 48; and فَشَلَ,
aor.
فَشُلَ; and فَشَلَ, aor.
فَشِلَ; two dial. vars., the
former of these agreeable with a reading of the
latter verse of the Kur-án, and the latter agreeable with a reading of the same verse by El-
Hasan El-Basree; (O;) He was, or became,
cowardly, (S, O, Msb, K,) and weak, (O, K,) or
weak-hearted, (Msb,) and flagging, remiss, or
languid, (K,) and timorous. (TA.)
-A2-  فَشَلَتْ, and
فَشَلَتْ مِفْشَلَهَا, (O,) or فَشَلَتْ فِشْلَهَا, (K, * TA, [in
the CK ↓ فَشَّلَتْهُ, the pronoun relating to الفِشْل,])
inf. n. فَشْلٌ; (TA;) and ↓ اِفْتَشَلَتْهُ, (O, K, * TA,)
thus accord. to the M as well as the O, (TA,)
i. e. مِفْشَلَهَا, (O,) or فِشْلَهَا; (TA;) [in the K
اِفْتَشَلَتْ alone, i. e. without any complement, as
though it were intrans.; or ↓ افشلت, which is
said in the TA to be the reading in the copies of
the K, but which I have not found in any;] and
↓ تفشّلت [mentioned without any complement, as
though intrans.]; (K, TA;) said of a woman,
(O, K, TA,) in relation to the فِشْل, (K,) which
is also called مِفْشَل, (IAar, O,) meaning She
hung a ثَوْب [or piece of cloth] (thus in the O,
in the TA her ثوب,) upon the [camel-vehicle
called] هَوْدَج, then put it [or drew it, or the main
part thereof,] within it, and bound its extremities
to the قَوَاعِد [or four pieces of wood that form a
square frame upon which it is fixed (see its sing.
قَاعِدَةٌ)]; this being [beneath her (see فِشْلٌ) so as
to be to her] a preservative from the heads of the
[curved pieces of wood called] أَحْنَآء [pl. of حِنْوٌ
q. v.] and the [apparatus called] أَقْتَاب [pl. of قِتْبٌ
q. v.] and the knots of the cord called عُصْم [pl. of
عِصَامٌ q. v.]: (O, TA:) so says ISh. (TA.)

فَشَّلَand 4: see the preceding paragraph.

تفشّل, said of water, It flowed. (S, O, K.)
-A2-  And He took a wife (ISh, O, K) مِنْهُمْ [from
among them, probably meaning persons not of his
own kindred: see مِفْشَلٌ]. (ISh, O.)
-A3-  See also 1.
8
إِفْتَشَلَ see 1, latter sentence.
فَشْلٌ Weak; (S, O, K;) or weak-hearted;
(Msb;) cowardly; (S, Msb, K;) flagging, remiss,
or languid; (K;) and accord. to the K, ↓ فَشِلٌ signifies the same, and one says, رَجُلٌ خَشْلٌ فَشْلٌ
and ↓ خَشِلٌ فَشِلٌ; but [SM says that] this is a
mistake, and [incorrectly] taken from a passage
of the M, in which it is stated that one says رَجُلٌ
خَشْلٌ فَشْلٌ and خَسْل فَسْلٌ; i. e., with ش in both
and with س in both; not that it is with fet-h in
both and like كَتِفٌ: (TA:) [I find, however,
↓ خَشِلٌ فَشِلٌ mentioned in art. خشل in the K,
and also, as from Ibn-'Abbád, in the same art. in
the O; and as ↓ فَشِلٌ is agreeable with a general
rule as part. n. of فَشِلَ, I think it probably correct;] the pl. is أَفْشَالٌ, (S,) or فُشْلٌ, (K,) or both.
(TA.) In the following verse, occurring in a
trad. respecting the prayer for rain, (O, TA,)
uttered to the Prophet by an Arab of the
desert, (O,)
وَلَا شَىْءَ مِمَّا يَأْكُلُ النَّاسُ عِنْدَنَا
سِوَى الحَنْظَلِ العَامِىِّ وَالعِلْهِزِ الفَشْلِ
by العِلْهِزِ الفَشْلِ is meant العِلْهِزِ الفَشْلِ آكِلُهُ
وَمُدَّخِرُهُ, i. e. الضَّعِيفِ; (O, TA; *) the phrase
being like الشَّجَرَةَ المَلْعُونَةَ in the Kur [xvii. 62],
i. e., آكِلُوهَا: [so that the verse means, And there
is nothing, of what men eat, in our possession, save
the colocynth that is a year old, and therefore dry,
or that has been laid up for the year of drought
or barrenness, and the food made of blood and the
fur of camels, the eater, and the storer, whereof
is weak]: (O, TA:) but it is also related with س,
[i. e. الفَسْلِ,] and thus does not need any paraphrastic interpretation. (TA.)
-A2-  See also what
next follows.
فِشْلٌ (O, K,) or ↓ فَشْلٌ, (S,) [but said to be]
with kesr, (O, K,) A certain thing (S, K) of the
apparatus of the [women's camel-vehicle called]
هَوْدَج, (S,) which the woman puts beneath her in
the هودج: (K:) or the curtain (سِتْر) of the هودج;
as also ↓ مِفْشَلٌ. (IAar, O, K.) [See a description thereof in the latter sentence of the first paragraph.]
فَشِلٌ: see فَشْلٌ, in four places.
فَيْشِلٌ: see the paragraph here following.
الفَيْشَلَةُ The حَشَفَة; (K;) [i. e.] the head [or
glans] of the penis: (S, O:) and the head of any
مُحَوَّق [or penis having a large glans]: (CK: in
the text of the K as given in the TA, مُجَوَّف:
[and thus in my MS. copy of the K; but it has
been there altered, app. to agree with the TA, as
have many other words in that copy; and the
former reading is evidently, I think, the right:]
some say that its ل is augmentative, like the ل
in عَبْدَلٌ and in [the proper name] زَيْدَلٌ: but it
may be from some other word than فَيْشَةٌ, though
this has nearly the same meaning, [or, as is said
in the TA in art. فيش, both have the same meaning,] and, if so, the ى may be augmentative,
which is more agreeable with analogy: (TA:)
the pl. is فَيَاشِلُ, (K,) and ↓ فَيْشَلٌ is another pl.
[or rather a coll. gen. n.] thereof, used as such in
a verse of Jereer. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [The pl.] فَيَاشِلُ signifies also a name of Certain trees. (K.) ―
-b3-
[Freytag adds as other meanings what belong to
a description of the proper name of a certain
water and of hills surrounding it, called الفَيَاشِلُ.]
تَفْشِيلٌ Milk remaining in the udder: (Fr, O,
K:) and so تَمْشِيلٌ. (Fr, O.)
مِفْشَلٌ: see فِشْلٌ.
-A2-  Also One who takes a wife
from among persons not of his own kindred, lest
the offspring should come forth spare in body, or
weak. (IAar, O, K, TA.)
مِفْشَلَةٌ The كيارجة [i. e. كَيَارِجَة], (ISh, TA,)
which is an arabicized word from the Pers. كراجه,
in Turkish قورسق [also written قُورْصَق, i. e. the
gizzard, or the crop, of a bird]. (TK voce مِشْفَلَةٌ
[which is said in the K to signify thus, and also
the stomach of a ruminant animal: one of the
two words thus expl. may be a mistranscription
for the other].)
