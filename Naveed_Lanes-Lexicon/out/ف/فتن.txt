فتن1
فَتَنَهُ, (T, S, M, &c.,) aor.
فَتِنَ, (M,) inf. n.
فَتْنٌ, (S, M, K,) [and quasi-inf. n., in this and
other senses, فِتْنَةٌ,] He burned it (T, * S, * M, K *)
in the fire. (M.) Hence, [in the Kur li. 13,]
يَوْمَ هُمْ عَلَى النَّارِ يُفْتَنُونَ (T, * S, M, K *) i. e. [The
day, or on the day, accord. to two different readings, (يَوْمُ and يَوْمَ, the latter of which is the
more common,)] when they shall be burned (T,
S, M, K) with the fire [of Hell]. (T.) And [in
the Kur lxxxv. 10,] إِنَّ الَّذِينَ فَتَنُوا الْمُؤْمِنِينَ
وَالْمُؤْمِنَاتِ Verily they who burned the believing
men and the believing women (T, S *) in the fire
kindled in the trench, or pit; throwing them
therein. (T.) This is said to be the primary signification of the verb. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And He melted
it with fire, (T,) or put it into the fire, (S, Msb,)
namely, gold, (T, S, Msb,) and silver, in order
to separate, or distinguish, (T, Msb,) the bad from
the good, (T,) or the good from the bad, (Msb,)
or to see what was its [degree of] goodness. (S.)
―
-b3-  And hence, accord. to Er-Rághib, الفَتْنُ is
used as meaning The causing a man to enter into
fire [app. by way of trial, or probation], and [in
like manner] into a state of punishment, or affliction: (TA:) [and it is also used as meaning the
slaying another; whence, in the Kur iv. 102,] إِنْ
خِفْتُمْ أَنْ يَفْتِنَكُمُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا means [If ye fear
that those who have disbelieved] may slay you;
and in like manner in the Chapter of Yoonus [i. e.
in x. 83], أَنْ يَفْتِنَهُمْ means ان يَقْتُلَهُمْ. (T. [In
the TA, these two exs. are misplaced, or something has been omitted before them by a copyist.])
―
-b4-  [Hence also,] one says, فَتَنَهُ, aor.
فَتِنَ, (K, TA,)
inf. n. فَتْنٌ, (TA,) He, or it, caused him to fall
into الفِتْنَة; (K, TA;) i. e. trial; and affliction,
distress, or hardship; [generally meaning an
affliction whereby some good or evil quality is put
to the test;] (TA;) as also ↓ اِفْتَتَنَهُ; and ↓ فتّنهُ;
(K, TA;) but this, of which the inf. n. is تَفْتِينٌ,
has an intensive signification; (S;) and ↓ أَفْتَنَهُ;
(K, TA;) which last is rare, or rather, accord.
to As, [though app. not in this sense, but in
another, to be mentioned in what follows,] is not
allowable: (TA:) the first of these verbs is trans.
and intrans.: (S, K, TA:) you say also, فَتَنَ,
(AZ, T, S, K, TA,) aor.
فَتِنَ, (AZ, T, K,) inf. n.
فُتُونٌ, (AZ, T, S, TA,) He fell into فِتْنَة [i. e.
trial, or affliction, &c.]; (AZ, T, K;) as also
↓ اِفْتَتَنَ: (K:) or the former signifies he shifted
from a good, to an evil, state or condition: or,
accord. to En-Nadr, one says ↓ اِفْتَتَنَ and اُفْتُتِنَ,
both meaning the same; and this is correct; but
فَتَنَ as quasi-pass. of فَتَنْتُهُ [i. e. as intrans.] is of
weak authority: (T:) and ↓ اُفْتُتِنَ, said of a man,
[as also اِفْتَتَنَ,] and فُتِنَ, signify the same, (S,
M,) accord. to AZ, (M,) i. e. he was smitten by
a فِتْنَة [or trial, &c.,] so that his wealth, or property, or his intellect, departed: and likewise he
was tried, or tested: (S:) and accord. to AZ,
one says, of a man, ↓ أُفْتِنَ, [if not a mistranscription for اُفْتُتِنَ, as above,] with damm,
meaning فُتِنَ: (TA:) [and فَتَنَهُ has فُتُونٌ also as
an inf. n.:] it is said in the Kur [xx. 41], وَفَتَنَّاكَ
فُتُونًا (S) i. e. And we tried thee with a [severe]
trying: or the noun in this instance is pl. of فَتْنٌ;
or of فِتْنَةٌ, formed by disregard of the ة, like حُجُوزٌ
and بُدُورٌ which are [said to be] pls. of حُجْزَةٌ and
بَدْرَةٌ; so that the meaning is, we tried thee with
several sorts of trying: (Bd:) or, as some say,
and we purified thee with a [thorough or an effectual] purifying [like that of gold, or silver, by
means of fire]: (TA:) [in many instances] فَتَنَهُ,
aor.
فَتِنَ, [inf. n. فَتْنٌ,] signifies He tried, or tested,
him; whence, in the Kur ix. 127, يُفْتَنُونَ means
They are tried, or tested, by being summoned to
war, against unbelievers or the like; or, as some
say, by the infliction of punishment or of some
evil thing. (M.) فَتَنْتُمْ أَنْفُسَكُمْ, in the Kur
[lvii. 13], means Ye caused yourselves to fall into
trial and punishment. (TA.) And وَهُمْ لَا يُفْتَنُونَ,
in the Kur xxix. 1, is expl. as meaning While they
are not tried in their persons and their possessions
so that he who has true faith may be known from
others by his patient endurance of trial. (T.)
And the saying, in a trad., إِنَّكُمْ تُفْتَنُونَ فِى القُبُورِ
means [Verily ye shall be tried, or tested, in the
graves by] the questioning of [the two angels]
Munkar and Nekeer. (TA.) [See also مَفْتُونٌ,
which is said to be an inf. n., and syn. with فِتْنَةٌ,
meaning خِبْرَةٌ, or with فُتُونٌ (mentioned above as
an inf. n. of the intrans. v. فَتَنَ), meaning
جُنُونٌ; as well as a pass. part. n.] ―
-b5-  And فَتَنَهٌ,
(M, TA,) inf. n. فَتْنٌ, (TA, [or perhaps فُتُونٌ, as
in the next following sentence]) also signifies
He made him (a man, M) to turn from, or quit,
(M, TA,) the predicament in which he was, (M,)
or the right course: (TA:) whence, in the Kur
[xvii. 75], وَإِنْ كَادُوا لَيَفْتِنُونَكَ عَنِ الَّذِى أَوْحَيْنَا
إِلَيْكَ (M, TA) i. e. [And verily they were near to]
their making thee to turn [from that which we
had revealed to thee]: thus this saying has been
explained. (TA.) [And He, or it, seduced him;
or tempted him: thus it may often be well rendered, agreeably with what next precedes and
what next follows, and with explanations of its
act. part. n. and of فِتْنَةٌ.] And one says, فَتَنَ
المَالُ النَّاسَ, aor.
فَتِنَ, inf. n. فُتُونٌ, [or perhaps فَتْنٌ,
as in the next preceding sentence,] meaning
Wealth, or property, inclined, or attracted, to it,
men, or mankind: and فُتِنَ فِى دِينِهِ and ↓ اُفْتُتِنَ,
both in the pass. form, He declined [or was made
to decline] from [the right way in] his religion.
(Msb.) And فَتَنَهُ, aor,
فَتِنَ, inf. n. فَتْنٌ and فُتُونٌ,
(M, K,) He, or it induced in him admiration,
or pleasure; (M, * K, * TA;) as also ↓ أَفْتَنَهُ [respecting which see what here follows]: (M, K:)
and one says, of a woman, فَتَنَتْهُ, (T, S,) meaning
[She enamoured him; or captivated his heart;
i. e.] she bereaved him of his heart, or reason,
(دَلَّهَتْهُ, [thus in several copies of the S, in one of
my copies بَلَّهَتْهُ,] and [so affected him that] he
loved her; (S;) as also ↓ أَفْتَنَتْهُ; (T, S;) the
former of the dial. of El-Hijáz, and the latter of
the dial. of Nejd; (T, S; *) but ↓ افتنتهُ, (T, S,)
or افتنهُ, (M,) was disallowed by As, (T, S, M,)
and he paid no regard to a verse mentioned to
him as an ex. thereof, (T,) [or] he ignored a
verse cited to him as an ex. of the pass. part. n.
from an أُرْجُوزَة of Ru-beh, not knowing it therein;
(M;) most of the lexicologists, however, allow
both: (T:) Sb says that فَتَنَهُ signifies he put [or
occasioned] in him فِتْنَة; and ↓ افتنهُ, he caused
الفِتْنَة to come to him [or to affect him]; (M;)
or he said that the latter means he made him to
be فَاتِن: (TA voce حَزَنَهُ:) and one says also, of
a man, فُتِنَ بالْمَرْأَةِ and ↓ اُفْتُتِنَ [both meaning He
was enamoured by the woman]. (T.) ―
-b6-  And
one says also, of a man, فَتَنَ, aor.
فَتِنَ, inf. n. فُتُونٌ,
meaning He desired الفُجُور [i. e. the committing of
adultery or fornication]: (AZ, TA:) or فَتَنَ إِلَى
النِّسَآءِ, inf. n. فُتُونٌ, he desired الفُجُور (T, M, K,
TA) with women or the women; as also فُتِنَ إِلَيْهِنَّ.

فَتْنٌ A sort, or species; and a state, or condition;
syn. ضَرْبٌ, (T, M, K,) and فَنٌّ, (T, K,) and لَوْنٌ,
(M, K,) and حَالٌ. (T, K.) Hence the saying of
'Amr Ibn-Ahmar El-Báhilee,
إِمَّا عَلَى نَفْسٍ وَإِمَّا لَهَا
وَالعَيْشُ فَتْنَانِ فَحُلْوٌ وَمُرْ
[Either against a soul or for it; life being of two
sorts, or conditions, sweet and bitter; مُرْ being for
مُرٌّ]; (T; and the latter hemistich, without the
incipient و, is cited in the K;) thus as related by
some: but as related by Aboo-Sa'eed [As], he
said فَنَّانِ, i. e. ضَرْبَانِ: and as related by Aboo-
'Amr Esh-Sheybánee, فِتْنَانِ [with kesr]; and [he
seems to have held that the poet meant two-sided;
for] he says that ↓ الفِتْنُ signifies النَّاحِيَةُ. (T.)
―
-b2-  And الفَتْنَانِ, (K, TA, [in the CK, erroneously, الفُتْنانِ,]) dual of الفَتْنُ, (TA,) signifies
The first and last parts of the day; or the early
part of the morning and the late part of the evening: (K, TA:) because they are two states, or
conditions, and two sorts. (TA.)
فِتْنٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
فِتْنَةٌ A burning with fire. (T.) ―
-b2-  And The
melting of gold and of silver (K, TA) in order to
separate, or distinguish, the bad from the good.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  And [hence, or] from فَتَنَ signifying
“ he melted,” (T,) or from that verb as signifying
“ he put into the fire, “(Msb,) gold, and silver,
“ for that purpose,” (T, Msb,) it signifies A trial,
or probation; (IAar, T, S, M, K, TA;) and
affliction, distress, or hardship; (TA;) and [particularly] an affliction whereby one is tried, proved,
or tested: (IAar, T, S, K, TA:) this is the sum
of its meaning in the language of the Arabs: (T,
TA: *) or the trial whereby the condition of a man
may be evinced: this, accord. to Zj, may be the
meaning in the Kur v. 45: (M:) or a mean
whereby the condition of a man is evinced, in
respect of good and of evil: (Kull:) [hence it
often means a temptation:] and ↓ مَفْتُونٌ signifies the same as فِتْنَةٌ, (S, M, K,) meaning a
trial: (K:) the pl. of فِتْنَةٌ is فِتَنٌ. (Msb.) It
proceeds from God and from man: (Er-Rághib,
TA:) [there are many instances of its proceeding
from God in the Kur; for ex., in xxxvii. 61,] إِنَّا
جَعَلْنَاهَا فِتْنَةً لِلظَّالِمِينَ i. e. [Verily we have made
it to be] a trial [to the wrongdoers] is said in
relation to the tree Ez-Zakkoom; the existence
of which they disbelieved; for when they heard
that it comes forth in the bottom of Hell, they
said, Trees become burned in the fire; then how
can they grow therein? (M.) [And hence] it signifies also Punishment, castigation, or chastisement. (T, M, K.) And Slaughter: (T:) and civil
war, or conflict occurring among people: (M:) and
slaughter, and war, and faction, or sedition, among
the parties of the Muslims when they form themselves into parties: (T:) and discord, dissension,
or difference of opinions, among the people. (IAar,
T, K.) A misleading; or causing to err, or go
astray: (T, K:) [seduction; or temptation: or
a cause thereof; such as] the ornature, finery,
show, or pomp, and the desires, or lusts, of the
present life or world, whereby one is tried: (T:)
and wealth, or children; (T, K, TA;) because
one is tried thereby: (TA:) and women; than
whom, the Prophet said, there is no فِتْنَة more
harmful to men: (T:) and a cause of one's being
pleased with a thing; (T, M, K;) as in the saying لَا تَجْعَلْنَا فِتْنَةً لِلْقَوْمِ الظَّالِمِينَ [in the Kur
x. 85, i. e. Make not us to be a cause of pleasure
to the wrongdoing people]; meaning, make not
them to prevail over us, so as to become pleased
with their unbelief and to think that they are
better than we. (T.) Also Madness, insanity,
or diabolical possession; (T, K;) and so ↓ فُتُونٌ
and ↓ مَفْتُونٌ. (T.) And Error; or deviation
from the right way. (M, K.) And Infidelity;
or unbelief: (T, M, K:) thus in the saying, [in
the Kur ii. 187,] وَالْفِتْنَةُ أَشَدُّ مِنَ الْقَتْلِ [And
infidelity, or unbelief, is more excessive than
slaughter: and the like is said in ii. 214]. (T.)
And A sin, a crime; or an act of disobedience
for which one deserves punishment. (M, K.) And
Disgrace, shame, or ignominy. (M, K.) فِتْنَةُ
الصَّدْرِ signifies الوَسْوَاسُ [app. as meaning The
devil's prompting, or suggesting, of some evil idea]:
فِتْنَةُ المَحْيَا, The being turned from the [right]
road: فِتْنَةُ المَمَاتِ, The being questioned in the
grave [by the two angels Munkar and Nekeer]:
فِتْنَةُ الضُّرِّ, The sword: and فِتْتَةُ السُّرِّ, Women.
(TA.) [And الفِتْنَةُ العَمْيَا is a phrase used in the
present day as meaning Incurable evil or trouble.]

the stones thereof were burnt: (Sh, T, S:) or a
black حَرَّة: (K:) or a حَرَّة wholly covered by black
stones, as though they were burnt: (M:) pl. فُتُنٌ:
(Sh, T, M, K:) and فَتَائِنُ signifies black حِرَار
[pl. of حَرَّةٌ]; (TA; [and the same is app. indicated in the T;]) as though its sing. were
↓ فَتِينَةٌ; and some say that this is a sing. [or
n. un.], and that فَتِين is the pl. [or coll. gen. n.];
but as some relate a verse of El-Kumeyt which
is cited as an ex. of فَتِينَة with the ة elided because
ending the verse, it is فِتِينَ, and said to be pl. of
فِتَةٌ, like as عِزِينَ is of عِزَةٌ. (T.)
-A2-  In the dial.
of El-Yemen it signifies Short; and small. (TA.)

فَاتِنٌ [is the act. part. n. of the trans. v. فَتَنَ;
and as such] signifies Causing to err, or go astray,
(T, S, M,) from the truth: (S:) hence the saying
in the Kur [xxxvii. 162], مَا أَنْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ بِفَاتِنِينَ,
(T, S, * M, *) which, accord. to Fr, means, Ye
have not power [over him] to cause him to err,
except him against whom it has been decreed
that he shall enter the fire [of Hell]; فاتنين
being made trans. by means of عَلَى because it
implies the meaning of قَادِرِينَ, which is thus
made trans.: (M:) Fr says, the people of El-
Hijáz say مَا أَنْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ بِفَاتِنِينَ; and the people of
Nejd, ↓ بِمُفْتِنِينَ, from أَفْتَنْتُ. (S.) ―

-A2-  It is also an epithet from the intrans. v.

some say that the ب is redundant; (M;) thus
says AO; (T;) the meaning being أَيُّكُمُ الْمَفْتُونُ

M;) but Zj disallowed this: (T:) J says, [in the
S,] that the ب is redundant, as in كَفَى بِاللّٰهِ شَهِيدًا,
in the Kur [xiii. last verse, &c.], and [thus in
copies of the S, app. a mistake for “ or ”] المفتون
means الفِتْنَةُ, and is an inf. n. [&c.]: IB says, [in
remarking upon this passage of the S,] if the ب
be redundant, المفتون is the man, and is not an
inf. n.; but if you make the ب to be not redundant, then المفتون is an inf. n. in the sense of
الفُتُون. (TA.) [See also art. ب; p. 142, second
col.; and p. 143, third col.]
مَفْتُونَةٌ is [a term] applied to A number of black

youths, or young men: said of an old, or elderly,
man; or one past the prime of life. (TA.) ―
-b2-
See also 2, in two places. ―
-b3-  And He affected,
or endeavoured to acquire, generosity: and also he
affected, or made a show of, generosity: (KL:)
you say تفتّى and ↓ تفاتى [app. as signifying the
same: but more properly the former verb has the
former of these two significations: and ↓ the latter
verb has the latter of the same two significations]:
both from الفُتُوَّةُ. (S, K, TA.)

تَ1َاْ2َ3َ see the next preceding sentence, in two
places:
-A2-  and see 3. You say, تَفَاتَوْا إِلَى الفَقِيهِ
They appealed to the lawyer for the notifying of
the decision of the law. (S, TA.)
10
اِسْتَفْتَيْتُ الفَقِيهَ فِى مَسْأَلَةٍ I sought, or demanded, of the lawyer, a notification of the decision of the law respecting a question. (T, * S, *
Msb, * TA.) And in like manner the verb is
used in the Kur iv. 126, and xxxvii. 149. (TA.)
فِتَةٌ A [stony tract such as is called] حَرّة [for
which some copes of the K have جَرَّة, a mistranscription, as may be seen from a statement
voce فَتِينٌ, in art. فتن, q. v.]: pl. فِتُونَ. (K,
TA.)
فَتًى i. q. شَابٌّ, (S, M, K, TA, but omitted in
the CK,) or غُلَامٌ حَدَثٌ, (T,) or شَابٌّ حَدَثٌ:
(Msb:) it is a subst. [signifying A youth, or
young man; or one in the prime of life]: and an
epithet [signifying youthful; or in the prime of
life]: (TA:) [as an epithet, similar to فَتِىٌّ, but
restricted in application to a human being:] or it
signifies, (Mgh,) or signifies also, (Msb,) a strong
youth or young man: (Mgh, Msb:) it is said
that in the Kur xviii. 59 and 61, it is applied by
Moses to Joshua the son of Nun, because he
served him: (M, TA:) the fem. is ↓ فَتَاةٌ: (S,
K:) ―
-b2-  and it also means (tropical:)  A slave; (T, M,
Mgh, Msb, TA;) even if an old man; metaphorically used in this sense; (Mgh, Msb, TA;) and
in like manner, ↓ فَتَاةٌ means (tropical:)  a female slave, (T,
M, Mgh, Msb, TA;) and a female servant: (TA:)
the Prophet is related to have said, Let not any
of you say عَبْدِى and أَمَتِى, but let him say فَتَاىَ
and فَتَاتِى: (T, Mgh:) ―
-b3-  and Generous, honourable, liberal, or bountiful: (S, K:) [mostly used
as an epithet in which the quality of a subst. predominates; meaning a generous man:] a possessor
of فُتُوَّة [q. v.]: hence the saying, لَا فَتَى إِلَّا عَلِىٌّ
[There is no one endowed with generosity but, or
other than, (meaning like,) 'Alee]: (TA:) ―
-b4-  the
dual of فَتًى is فَتَيَانِ and فَتَوَانِ; (K, TA;) the
former occurring in the Kur xii. 36: (TA:) the
pl. of فَتًى is فِتْيَةٌ, (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) a pl. of
pauc., (Msb,) not mentioned in the K, though
occurring in the Kur xviii. 9 & 12, (TA,) instead
of which they did not say أَفْتَآءٌ, (Sb, M,) and فِتْوَةٌ,
(M, K,) [also a pl. of pauc.,] mentioned by Lh,
(M,) and (of mult., Msb) فِتْيَانٌ (T, S, M, Mgh,
Msb, K) and فُتُوٌّ (T, S, M, K) and فُتِىٌّ: (S, M,
K:) the pl. of ↓ فَتَاةٌ is فَتَيَاتٌ: (S, M, Msb, K:)
the dim. of فَتًى is ↓ فُتَىٌّ; and that of فَتَاةٌ is ↓ فُتَيَّةٌ.
(T.) [It is disputed whether the last radical letter
of this and other words mentioned in the present
art. be originally و or ى.] ―
-b5-  الفَتَيَانِ means (tropical:)  The
night and the day; (S, M, K, TA;) like الأَجَدَّانِ
and الجَدِيدَانِ: (S, TA:) or, accord. to Seer, the
morning and the evening, or the early part of the
morning and the late part of the evening, or the
forenoon and the afternoon; syn. الغَدَاةُ وَالعَشِىُّ.
(Har p. 377.) And you say, أَقْمَتُ عِنْدَهُ فَتًى مِنْ
نَهَارٍ i. e. (tropical:)  I remained, stayed, or abode, with him
during a first part of a day. (TA.)
فَتَاةٌ fem. of فَتًى: see the next preceding paragraph, in three places.
فَتْوَى (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K) and فُتْوَى, (M,
K, TA,) [but the latter is mentioned by few,] and
↓ فُتْيَا, (T, S, M, Msb, K,) substs. from أَفْتَى, (T,
S,) and as such used in the place of [the inf. n.]
إِفْتَآءٌ [i. e. The giving an answer, or a reply, stating
the decision of the law, respecting a question]: (T:)
[or rather, as commonly used, a notification of
the decision of the law, in, or respecting, a particular case;] a notification, or an explanation,
of a case, given by a lawyer; (M, K;) or an
answer, or a reply, to a question relating to a
dubious judicial decision: (Er-'Rághib, TA:)
[fancifully said in the Mgh and Msb to be
derived from الفَتَى:] the pl. is فَتَاوٍ, and فَتَاوَى is
said to be allowable, (Msb, TA,) and another pl.
is فُتًى, mentioned by IKoot. (TA.)
فُتْيَا: see the next preceding paragraph.
فَتَآءٌ [mentioned in the first sentence of this art.
as an inf. n.] Youth, or youthfulness; or the prime
of life; (T, S, M, K;) and so ↓ فُتَوَّةٌ, (T, M,) as
a subst. from فَتًى and from فَتِىٌّ: (M:) or the
latter is used in relation to human beings; and
the former, to camels [and the like], and also,
metaphorically, to human beings: (T:) one says,
قَدْ وُلِدَ فِى فَتَآءِ سِنِّهِ أَوْلَادٌ [Children had, or
have, been born to him in the youthfulness, or
prime, of his age]. (S.)
فُتَىٌّ dim. of فَتًى, q. v., latter half. ―
-b2-  Hence,
i. e. because of its smallness, (Z, TA,) الفُتَىُّ signifies what is called قَدَحُ الشُّطَّارِ [which may be
rendered (tropical:)  The cup, or bowl, of the rogues];
(IAar, T, Z, K, TA;) [a cup, or bowl,] with
which wine is measured; (TA;) tropically thus
called. (Z, TA.)
فَتِىٌّ Youthful; or in the prime of life; (Lth,
T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K;) contr. of مُسِنٌّ; (S,
Mgh, Msb;) applied to a camel, (T,) or to a
beast, (S, Mgh, Msb,) or to anything [i. e. to a
beast and to a human being]; (M, K;) or it is
like فَتًى [which is applied peculiarly to a human
being], but is sometimes applied to a camel: (M:)
[this last statement, however, requires confirmation, which I have not been able to find: the
epithet is generally known as applied only to a
camel or the like:] the fem. is فَتِيَّةٌ; (Lth, T, M,
Mgh, Msb, K;) of which the dim. is ↓ فُتَيَّةٌ:
(TA:) and the pl. is أَفْتَآءٌ (T, S, Mgh, Msb, TA)
and فِتَآءٌ. (M, K, TA. [The former pl., though
the more common, is not mentioned in the M nor
in the K.])
فُتُوَّةٌ: see فَتَآءٌ. ―
-b2-  [Also Youthful conduct.]
One says, مَالَ إِلَى الجَهْلِ وَالفُتُوَّةِ [He inclined to
ignorant, or foolish, or silly, and youthful, conduct]. (S in art. صبو). ―
-b3-  And Generosity, honourableness, liberality, or bountifulness: (S, K, TA:)
used as meaning thus in [treatises on] the law;
but not occurring in the Sunneh nor in the Scripture [i. e. the Kur-án]: the earliest mentioner
thereof was Jaafar Es-Sádik. (TA.)
فُتَيَّةٌ: see فَتًى, latter half: and see also فَتِىٌّ.
أَفْتَى i. q. أَصْغَرُ [as meaning less, and least, in
years, or age]: from الفتى [i. e. الفَتَى or الفَتِىُّ].
(Ham p. 207.)
أُفَيْتِيَةٌ [an irreg.] dim. of فِتْيَةٌ [which is a pl. of
فَتًى; like as أُصَيْبِيَةٌ, accord. to Sb, is dim. of صِبْيَةٌ,
a pl. of صَبِىٌّ]. (TA.)
مُفْتٍ [A jurisconsult who notifies the decisions
of the law, in, or respecting, cases submitted to
him, for the guidance of the قَاضِى and others].
―
-b2-  [And] المُفْتِى is the name of A certain
measure of capacity, called the مِكْيَال of Hishám
Ibn-Hubeyreh. (As, T, M, K.)
