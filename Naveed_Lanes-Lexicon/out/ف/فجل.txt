فَجِلَ, aor.
فَجَلَ, inf. n. فَجَلٌ; (Msb, K;) and

فَجُلَ, (O, K,) inf. n.

soft, or flaccid: (O, Msb, K:) so says Ibn-

افتجل أَمْرًا, (K,) or أَمْرَهُ, (Ibn-'Abbád, O,)
He forged [a case or matter &c., or his case &c.];
syn. اِخْتَلَقَهُ; (Ibn-'Abbád, O, K;) and invented
it, or excogitated it; syn. اِخْتَرَعَهُ. (Ibn-'Abbád, O.)
فُجْلٌ (S, O, K) and ↓ فُجُلٌ, (O, K,) both mentioned by AHn, (O, TA,) or ↓ فِجْلٌ, (Msb,) thus,
with kesr, commonly pronounced by the vulgar,
(TA,) [The radish, raphanus sativus; (Forskål's
Flora Ægypt. Arab., lxix. no. 327; and Delile's
Floræ Ægypt. Illustr., no. 608;)] a certain أَرُومَة
[or root of the kind termed rhizoma], (K, TA,)
that occasions abominable eructation; (TA;) a
herb, (Msb,) well known: (S, Msb:) said by IDrd
to be not a genuine Arabic word; and thought by
him to be derived from فَجِلَ signifying as expl.
above: (Msb:) n. un. with ة, (K,) i. e. فُجْلَةٌ (S,
O) and فُجُلَةٌ (O) [and فِجْلَةٌ]: it is a gardenplant, found in abundance; and there is a Syrian
sort, said to be produced by putting together the
seeds of the colza and [those of] the فجل: (TA:)
it (i. e. each sort, TA) is good for pain of the
joints, and jaundice, (K, TA,) and sciatica, and
the نِقْرِس [i. e. gout, or specially in the foot or
feet], (TA,) and pain of the liver (K, TA) arising
from cold, (TA,) and the biting and stinging of
vipers and scorpions: (K, TA: [several other supposed properties thereof mentioned in the K, and
many more mentioned in the TA, I omit as unimportant:]) what is most potent thereof is its
seed; then, its peel; then, its leaf; then, its flesh.
(K, TA.) What is called حَبُّ الفُجْلِ is Another
remedial thing: (K:) this فجل is not of the species
of herb mentioned above: (O, Msb, TA:) so says
AHn: the hakeem Dáwood says, it is one of the
species of this فجل, a wild species, elongated,
abounding in the Sa'eed of Egypt: (TA:) [it is
the raphanus oleifer, mentioned by Delile (Floræ
Ægypt. Illustr., no. 609,) as cultivated in Nubia
and in Egypt, and called in Arabic “ symâgah: ”]
from it (or from its seed, TA) is made the oil of
the فجل (دُهْنُ الفُِجْلِ); (Msb, K, TA;) and it is
known by the appellation of السَّيْمَعَةُ [correctly
السَّيْمَغَةُ]. (TA.) [Delile, ubi suprà, no. 571,
mentions فِجْل الجَمَل, as a name of The cakile
maritima of Tournefort; the bunias cakile of
Linn.: and in the same, no. 396, he mentions
فِجْل الجَبَل as the Arabic name of The rumex
spinosus of Linn.; as does also Forskål, in his
work cited above, p. lxv., no. 213, and again in
p. 76.]
