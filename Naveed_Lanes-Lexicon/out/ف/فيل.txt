فيل1
فَالَ رَأْيُهُ, aor. يَفِيلُ, (S, M, O, K,) inf. n.
فُيُولَةٌ, (S,) thus in some copies of the K and in
the A, (TA,) or فَيْلُولَةٌ, (M, O,) thus in other
copies of the K, (TA,) and فَيَالَةٌ, thus in the O,
but in the copies of the K فَيْلَة, (TA,) His judgment, or opinion, was weak, (S, M, O, K,) and
erroneous; (M, K;) as also ↓ تفيّل; (M, Z, K,
TA;) and [in like manner] فِى رَأْيِهِ ↓ فَيَّلَ [not فُيِّلَ]
he was incorrect in his judgment, or opinion; and
↓ فَيَّلُوا occurs in a trad. as meaning فال رَأْيُهُمْ:
(TA:) [and فَالَ alone, said of a man, signifies
the same as فال رَأْيُهُ, as is shown by a verse of
El-Kumeyt cited in the T and M and O and TA:
but it seems from what here follows (taken from
a passage unconnected with the foregoing) that
the first and third of what are mentioned above
as inf. ns. are regarded by some as simple substs.:]
and one says, ↓ فِى رَأْيِهِ فَيَالَةٌ, (T, M, K, TA,)
the last word like سَحَابَةٌ, (TA, [in the CK, erroneously, فى رِوَايَةٍ فِيَالَةٌ,]) and ↓ فُيُولَةٌ, (M, K, TA,)
meaning [In his judgment, or opinion, is] a weakness. (TA.)
-A2-  And فال signifies also He (a
man) magnified himself, and became like the elephant (الفِيل); or he showed a morose aspect:
(TA:) [or it may so signify: IAar cites the
following verse:
مِنَ النَّاسِ أَقْوَامٌ إِذَا صَادَفُوا الغِنَى
تَوَلَّوْا وَفَالُوا لِلصَّدِيقِ وَفَخَّمُوا
which may mean [Of mankind are folks who,
when they find riches, turn the back, and] magnify
themselves and become like the elephant [to the
friend, and aggrandize themselves] or show a
morose aspect to the friend [&c.]; for the elephant is morose in aspect. (M.)
2
فيّل رَأْيَهُ, (S, M, K,) inf. n. تَفْيِيلٌ, He
declared [or esteemed] his judgment, or opinion,
to be weak, (S.) or bad, and erroneous. (M, K.)
Umeiyeh Ibn Abee-'Áïdh says,
فَلَوْ غَيْرَهَا مِنْ وُلْدِ كَعْبِ بْنِ كَاهِلٍ
مَدَحْتَ بِقَوْلٍ صَادِقٍ لَمْ تُفَيَّلِ
meaning لَمْ يُفَيَّلْ رَأْيُكَ (SKr, M) i. e. [But hadst
thou praised other than her, of the children of
Kaab Ibn-Káhil, with a true saying,] thy judgment, or opinion, would not have been declared
weak. (SKr.) ―
-b2-  See also 1, in two places.

فَايَلَ, [inf. n. مُفَايَلَةٌ and فِيَالٌ, (see الفَيَالُ
below,)] He played [at the game called الفَيَال:
see its part. n. below]. (O.)
5
تفيّل: see 1.
-A2-  Also He (a man, K, [or a
camel, as is indicated in the O,]) became fat, (O,
K,) as though he were a فِيل [or an elephant].
(O.) [See also 10.] ―
-b2-  And, said of youth, or
young manhood, (الشَّبَاب,) It increased, (Lth, T,
M, O, K,) and became in its prime and fulness.
(Lth, T, O.) ―
-b3-  And, said of herbage, It became
tall, and full-grown; or became of its full height,
and blossomed. (Th, M, K.)
10
اِسْتَفْيَلَ He (a camel) became like the فِيل
[or elephant] (M, K, TA) in bigness: (TA:)
mentioned by IJ among the class of اسْتَحْوَذَ and
the like: part. n. مُسْتَفْيِلٌ. (M.) [See also 5.]
فَالٌ: see فِيلٌ, latter half:
-A2-  and the paragraph
commencing with فَائِلُ الرَّأْىِ, near its end:
-A3-
and see also فَأْلٌ, in art. فأل.
فَيْلٌ: see the paragraph here following.
فِيلُ [The elephant; Pers. پيل;] a certain
animal, (TA,) well known: pl. [of pauc.] أَفْيَالٌ
and [of mult.] فُيُولٌ and فِيَلَةٌ; (S, M, O, Msb,
K;) not أَفْيِلَةٌ: (ISk, S, O, Msb:) accord. to Sb.
فِيلٌ may be originally of the measure فُعْلٌ, (S,
M, O,) pronounced with kesr because of the ى,
like as they said أَبْيَضُ and بيضٌ; but Akh says,
this is not the case in the sing, but only in the
pl.: (S, O:) fem. with ة. (M, K) ―
-b2-  Hence,
لَيْلَةٌ مِثْلُ لَوْنِ الفِيلِ [lit. A night like the colour of
the elephant;] meaning a night that is black. (M,
TA,) and dust-coloured; (M;) in which one
knows not the right course to pursue: the colours
of the فيل being of this kind. (M, TA.) ―
-b3-
[Hence, also, دَآءُ الفِيلِ The disease called by us
the tumid Barbadoes leg; because the leg of the
patient resembles that of the elephant by reason
of its enormously-swollen state: not (as some
have supposed it to be) elephantiasis; this latter
being termed جُذَام (q. v.) [―
-b4-  And hence, likewise, used as an epithet,] فِيلٌ signifies also
(tropical:)  Heavy [or dull]; and low, ignoble, or mean.
(K, TA.) ―
-b5-  And one says رَجُلٌ فِيلُ الرَّأْىِ,
meaning A man weak in respect of judgment, or
opinion; (T, S, M, O, K;) and so ↓ فِيْلُهُ; (M,
K;) and ↓ فَائِلُهُ: (T, M, O, K;) and ↓ فَيِّلُهُ,
(ISk, T, S, M, O, K,) of the measure فَيْعِل; (O:)
and ↓ فَالُهُ, (T, M, O, K,) and فَالٌ alone. (S, K.)
meaning weak in respect of judgment, or opinion;
(T, S, M, O, K;) erring in insight: (S:) pl. of
the first] أَفْيَالٌ: (S, M, O, K:) but AO says, the
↓ فَائِل is one who, inspecting, forms an opinion and
errs; if he err after examining a horse in all its
states or conditions and forming an opinion respecting it from his inspection, [not while doing
so,] he is not reckoned to be فائل. (TA.)
الفَيَالُ and الفِيَالُ, (Lth, T, M, O, K) the
former a subst, and the latter an inf. n. [of 3],
(Lth, T, O,) and ↓ المُفَايَلَةُ [which is likewise an
inf. n. of 3], (M, K,) A certain game, (Lth, T,
M, O, K,) well known, (O,) of the children, (T,)
or of the youths, or young men, of the Arabs (M,
K) of the desert, (M,) with earth, or dust: (Lth,
T, M, O:) a thing is hidden in earth, or dust,
which is then divided (T, M) into two portions;
then the hider says to his companion, In which of
them twain is it? (T;) and if he [who is thus
questioned] mistake, the hider says to him فَالَ
رَأْيُكَ: (T, M, * K; *) ISk termed it الفِئَالُ, with ء;
(O;) and it has been mentioned before in art.
فأل: (T, O, K:) accord. to some, (TA,) this
game is called الطَّبَنُ and السُدَّرُ. (T, TA. [But
see the former of these two words.])
فَيَالَةٌ: see the first paragraph.
فُيُولَةٌ: see the first paragraph.
فَيِّلُ اللَّحْمِ A man having much flesh: (T, O, *
K:) some pronounce it with ء, (T, O,) saying
فَيأَل, (T,) or فَئِل; (O;) both mentioned before
[in art. فأل]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  فَيِّلُ الرَّأْىِ: see فِيلٌ,
latter half.
فَيِّالٌ The attendant, or master, (S, M, O, Msb,
K,) or the keeper, or driver, (MA, KL,) of the
فِيل [or elephant], (S, MA, O, Msb, KL,) or of
the فِيلَة. (So in the M and K.)
فَائِلُ الرَّأْىِ: see فِيلٌ, latter half, in two places.
-A2-  الفَائِلُ [as a subst.] signifies The flesh that is
upon the خُرْبَة, (S, O,) or خُرْب, (K, [in the M,
accord. to the TT, حرف, app. a mistranscription,])
of the وَرِك; (S, M, O, K;) [which, I think, will
be plainly seen from what follows to mean the
flesh that is upon the sacro-ischiatic foramen;
though خُرْبَةُ الوَرِكِ and خُرْبُ الوَرِكِ are said in the
TA, in art. خرب, to mean “ the hole where the
head of the thigh-bone is inserted; ”] so says
A 'Obeyd: (S, O:) or, (S, M, O, K,) as some
say, so adds A 'Obeyd, (S, O,) a certain vein (T,
S, M, O, K) in the خُرْبَة of the وَرِك, descending
into the leg, (T,) or in the thigh: (S, O:) As
says, in “ the Book of the Horse,” in the وَرِك is
the خُرْبَة, which is a نُقْرَة wherein is flesh, no
bone being in it; and in that نُقْرَة is the فَائِل,
and there is no bone between the said نقرة and
the belly, but only skin and flesh; (T, * S, O;)
and he cites the saying of El-Aashà,
قَدْ نَخْضِبُ العَيْرَ فِى مَكْنُونِ فَائِلِهِ
وَقَدْ يَشِيطُ عَلَى أَرْمَاحِنَا البَطَلُ
[Oft we stain the ridge of the spear-head in what
is concealed in the interior of his فائل, and oft the
man of valour dies by means of our spears]; مَكْنُونُ
الفَائِلِ means his blood: he says [by implication],
we are skilful in respect of the place of piercing:
(S, O:) but As said مِنْ in the place of فِى; and
AA, قَدْ نَطْعُنُ; which has been pronounced to
be wrong: (O:) or the فَائِلَانِ, (T, M,) or the
↓ فَائِلَتَانِ, (so in the K, [app. a mistranscription,])
are two veins entering into the interior parts of
the thighs (T, M, K,) in the hinder parts thereof;
(M, K;) and they adduce as an evidence thereof
the verse of El-Aashà cited above, saying that the
epithet مكنون would not have been used if the
فائل were not a vein; but others say that [the
poet meant that] he made the spear-head to
become concealed in the furthest part of the flesh;
and if the فائل were a vein, it would not have
been mentioned as it has been in a phrase of
Imra-el-Keys which will be cited in what follows:
(M:) [hence it is said,] or they are two portions
of flesh [between which is the lower part of the os
sacrum, i. e.] the lower parts of which are upon the
صَلَوَان [dual of صَلًا], from the region of the lower
portions of the حَجَبَتَانِ to the عَجْب, bordering
upon the عُصْعُص on either side, descending in the
two sides of the two thighs; [so in a human being,]
and thus in the horse: (M, K: [for the meanings
of the words that I have here left untranslated, I
must refer to their several proper arts.; as they
are variously explained:]) ↓ الفَالُ is a dial. var. of
الفَائِلُ; (M, K, TA;) which is expl. by Sgh [in
the O] as meaning a certain vein issuing from the
فَوَّارَة of the وَرِك [i. e. from the sacro-ischiatic
foramen]: (TA:) [but the assertion that الفال
is a dial. var. of الفائل seems to be founded only
upon what here follows:] Imra-el-Keys says,
[describing a horse,]
لَهُ حَجَبَاتٌ مُشْرِفَاتٌ عَلَى الفَالِ
(S, M; or على الفَالِى, as in the O and TA;) [i. e.
He has edges of the haunch-bones projecting above,
or beyond, the فائل; for] he means على فَائِلِ,
having altered the latter word by transposition.
(T, S, O, TA.)
فَائِلَةٌ: see its dual in the next preceding paragraph, near the middle.
أَفْيَلُ [More, and most, weak, or erroneous;
relating to a judgment, or an opinion]. أَفْيَلُ مِنَ
الرَّأْىِ الدَّبَرِىِّ is a prov., meaning [More weak]
than an opinion that is given after the affair [to
which it relates] has passed. (Meyd.)
مُفَايِلٌ [in the S and O in art. فأل, with ء, i. e.
مُفَائِلٌ,] Playing at the game called الفَيَالُ.
(M, O.)
المُفَايَلَةُ expl. as a subst.: see الفَيَالُ.
مَفْيُولَآء [a quasi-pl. n. (like مَشْيُوخَآءُ &c.), but
one of which the sing. (if it have one) is not mentioned,] The young ones of the فِيل [or elephant].
(O, K.)
مُسْتَفْيِلٌ part. n. of 10, q. v. (M.)
