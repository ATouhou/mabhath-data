فرسنالفِرْسِنُ, of the camel, is What corresponds to
the حَافِر [or hoof] of the horse or a similar beast:
(S, K:) or the part which is below the رُسْغ [or
pastern] and in which are the bones called سُلَامَى
[q. v.]: and sometimes it is (tropical:)  of the sheep or goat:
it is of the fem. gender: and the pl. is فَرَاسِنُ:
(TA:) accord. to Ibn-Es-Sarráj, the ن is augmentative, because it is from فَرَسْتُ, (S, TA,) and
[therefore] it has been mentioned before [in art.
فرس, in which see more]. (S.)
الفِرْسَانُ: see what next follows.
الفُرَاسِنُ The lion; (K, TA;) as also ↓ الفِرْسَانُ:
and so [الفُرَانِسُ and] الفِرْنَاسُ. (TA.) See also the
last paragraph below.
الفُرَاسِيُونُ, (K, TA,) with damm, (TA,) The
كُرَّاث جَبَلِىّ [lit. mountain-leek]: (K, TA:) so
it is said to be: it is a four-sided أَصْل [app.
meaning stem], from which rise many white, foursided, branches, whereon sometimes grow rough
leaves like the thumb; and it has a blossom
inclining to blueness and yellowness: (TA:) it
has the property of clearing the complexion, dissolves thick humours, is diuretic, opens obstructions,
and is beneficial as a remedy for the bite of the
dog, (K, TA,) i. e. of the mad dog: (TA:) [it is
now applied in Cairo to euphrasia: (Forskål,
Descr. Anim. &c., p. 145:) and marrubium plicatum. (Idem, Flora Aegypt. Arab., pp. lxviii.
and 213.)]
مُفَرْسَنُ الوَجْهِ, with fet-h to the س, Having
much flesh in the face. (K.) Perhaps the lion
is hence called ↓ فُرَاسِنُ. (TA.)
