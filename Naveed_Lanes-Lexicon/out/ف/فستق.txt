فستقفُسْتُقٌ and فُسْتَقٌ, (O, Msb, K,) the latter the
more agreeable with the original, (O,) which is
پِسْتَه, (O, K,) a Pers. word, (O,) for from this
each is arabicized; (O, Msb, * K;) [The pistachio-nut, pistacia vera of Linn.;] a certain
fruit; (O;) [in the Msb بقل; perhaps a mistranscription for نقل, i. e. نَقْلٌ, a certain fruit
that is eaten with wine;] well known: (K:) said
in a verse of Aboo-Nukheyleh to be مِنَ البُقُولِ:
thus, and thus only, with ب, the phrase is related: if it were من النُّقُولِ, the mistake would
be removed: (O:) Az says that the فستقة [which
is the n. un.] is a fruit of a well-known tree: and
AHn says, “It has not come to my knowledge
that it grows in the land of the Arabs: ” (TA:)
it is good for the liver, and the mouth of the
stomach, and the colic, and the odour of the
mouth. (K. [In the CK, النَّهَكَةِ is put for النَّكْهَةِ.])
The vulgar pronounce the word with fet-h [to the
ف, saying فَسْتُق: and many of them say فِسْتُق].
(Msb.)
ثَوْبٌ فُسْتُقِىٌّ [meaning A garment of the colour
of the فُسْتُق] is [thus] with damm [to the ف and
ت]. (Msb.)
