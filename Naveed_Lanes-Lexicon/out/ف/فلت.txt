or well, performed or effected: pl. فَلَتَاتٌ: it has
no broken pl.: (M, TA:) and فَلَتَاتٌ signifies

would take his blood-revenge, and if he delayed
to do so, and the next day arrived, the sacred
month commenced, and the opportunity escaped
him: (M, TA:) or an hour observed by the Arabs
in the Time of Ignorance; namely, the last hour
of the last day of Jumáda-l-Ákhireh: they made

Rejeb not commencing until sunset: (AHeyth,
T, TA:) or لَيْلَةُ فَلْتَةٍ (or accord. to MF لَيْلَةُ
الفَلْتَةِ, TA,) the night by [the deducting of] which
the month becomes deficient, and by [the addition
of] which it becomes complete; for sometimes
some persons see the new moon when others do
not see it, and these latter make a hostile attack,
or incursion, upon the others; and it is thus
called because it is like a thing that has been let
loose after having been bound. (M, TA.)
