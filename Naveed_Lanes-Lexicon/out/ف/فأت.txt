فأت8
اِفْتَأَتَ عَلَىّ He said of me what was false:
(AZ, S, O:) or افتأت عَلَىَّ البَاطِلَ he forged against
me what was false: (K:) and افتأت عَلَىَّ مَا لَمْ أَقُلْ
he forged against me what I did not say. (M.)
-A2-  And افتأت عَلَيْنَا He was alone in his opinion
against us; none sharing it with him: (ISh, T,
TA:) or افتأت بِرَأْيِهِ he was alone, or singular,
in his opinion: (ISk, S, O, K:) and in like
manner in his affair, or case. (ISk, TA.) This
verb, thus used, (not known to Az with a radical
hemz in this sense except as mentioned by ISh
and ISk, TA,) is mentioned with hemz by AA
and AZ and ISk and others: it is therefore not
from الفَوْتُ, unless it be an instance of the application of hemz to that to which it does not
properly belong, as in the cases of حَلَّأْتُ السَّوِيقَ,
and لَبَّأْتُ بِالحَجِّ, and رَثَأْتُ المَيِّتَ. (S, O.) [See
also art. فوت.]
-A3-  اُفْتُئِتَ, in the pass form, He
(a man, O) died suddenly: (O, K:) but this,
app., [if not a mistake for اُفْتُلِتَ,] should be
اُفْتِيتَ, without hemz, from مَوْتُ الفَوَاتِ. (TA.)
فُؤَيْتٌ, applied to a man and to a woman, One
who follows his, or her, own opinion only. (From
a marg. note in a copy of the S. [Thus pronounced by AZ: by others, فُوَيْتٌ, without
hemz: see art. فوت.])
