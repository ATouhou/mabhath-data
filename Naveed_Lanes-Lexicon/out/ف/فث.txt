فَثَّ جُلَّتَهُ, (T, O, K,) [aor.
فَثُ3َ,] inf. n. فَثٌّ,
(T,) He scattered the dates of his جُلَّة [or receptacle made of palm-leaves]. (T, O, * K.) ―
-b2-  And

فَثُ3َ, (M, TA,) inf. n. فَثٌّ,
(TA,) He abated, or allayed, the heat of the hot

TA.) [See also فَثَأَ.]
7
انفثّ, inf. n. اِنْفِثَاثٌ, i. q. اِنْكَسَرَ [accord. to
the TK used in its proper sense as signifying It
broke, or became broken: but for this I find no
authority]. (T, O, K.) So in the saying, انفثّ
الرَّجُلُ مِنْ هَمٍّ أَصَابَهُ [The man became broken in
spirit, or languid, from anxiety, or solicitude, that
befell him]. (T, O.)
8
مَا افْتُثَّ بَنُو فُلَانٍ قَطُّ means The sons of such
a one have not been overcome, or subdued, hitherto,
or ever. (AA, O, K. *)
فَثٌّ A certain plant, the grain of which is made
into bread, (S, M, O, K,) and eaten, (S, M, O,)
in the time of drought, or dearth: (S, M, O, K:)
in some of the copies of the K, يُخْتَبَأُ is put for
يُخْتَبَزُ: (M, F:) the bread made of it is coarse,
or thick, resembling the bread that is baked in hot
ashes [which is generally made in the form of
thick round cakes]: (S, O:) a grain resembling
[the species of millet called] جَاوَرْس, which is made
into bread, and eaten: (IAar, T:) it is a wild
grain, which the Arabs of the desert take, in the
times of hunger, and pound, or bruise, and make
into bread; and it is a bad kind of food, but
sometimes, or often, they are content with it for
days: (T:) or, as some say, it is [a plant] of the
species called نَجِيل, growing in salt lands, of the
[plants termed] حُمُوض [pl. of حَمْض], of which
bread is made: [a coll. gen. n.:] n. un. فَثَّةٌ: (Th,
M:) Aboo-Ziyád El-Kilábee says, the فَثّ, like
the دُعَاع, is a herb (بَقْلَة) in which comes forth
grain, and each of them spreads [upon the ground],
not growing up high; and when they become dry,
the people collect what is dry thereof, then pound,
or bruise, it, and winnow it, and take forth from
it a sort of black grain, with which they fill sacks,
and lade the camels: it is a black sort of grain
like the شَهْنِيز [q. v.], and they make bread of it,
and make عَصِيدَة (يَعْتَصِدُونَ): (O:) in the Bári'
it is said to be a species of tree or plant (شَجَرٌ)
growing in the plain, or soft, lands, and on the
[eminences called] آكَام, having a sort of grain
like the حِمَّص [or chick-peas], of which are made
bread and سَوِيق. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  And accord. to
IF, الفَثُّ signifies The هَبِيد, (O, Msb,) meaning
the pulp of the colocynth, شَحْمُ الحَنْظَلِ, (O,) or
the colocynth-plant, شَجَرُ الحَنْظَلِ. (Msb: and
this is one of the meanings assigned to الفَثُّ in
the K. [In the TK, شَحْمُ الحَنْظَلِ is said to be
the correct explanation: but from what will be
seen voce هَبِيدٌ, I think it most probable that the
right meaning is The seeds of the colocynth.]) ―
-b3-
IF also says that it signifies The فَسِيل [i. e. shoot,
or shoots, of the palm-tree,] which is, or are,
plucked forth [entire,] from the base thereof. (O.)
-A2-  تَمْرٌ فَثٌّ Dates that are scattered; (Lth, Kr,
M, K;) not in a provision-bag or other receptacle;
like بَثٌّ: (Kr, M:) or dates that are separate,
each one from others; not sticking together; (T,
O;) and so فَذٌّ and بَذٌّ and فَضٌّ. (T.)
مَفَثَّةٌ Multitude: (T, O, K:) so in the saying,
وُجِدَ لِبَنِى فُلَانٍ مَفَثَّةٌ [Multitude was found to be
attributable to the sons of such a one] when they
were numbered: (T, O:) and مَقَثَّةٌ signifies the
same. (K and TA in art. قث.) ―
-b2-  And [i. q.
نُزُلٌ:] one says, مَا رَأَيْنَا جُلَّةً أَكْثَرَ مَفَثَّةً مِنْهَا, meaning نُزُلًا [i. e. We have not seen a receptacle made
of palm-leaves, for dates, having more food prepared for the guest than it]: (T, O:) and كَثِيرُ
مَفَثَّةٍ means كَثِيرُ نُزُلٍ [i. e. Abundant in respect
of food prepared for the guest]. (So in some
copies of the K: in other copies نَزَلٍ. [The TA
gives the latter reading; and so, therefore, does
the TK, which explains it as meaning “ increase,”
and adds that one says طعام كثير مفثة, an ex.
app. without any authority; for what I have
cited from the T and O shows, I think, that the
former reading, and not the latter, is unquestionably right.])
