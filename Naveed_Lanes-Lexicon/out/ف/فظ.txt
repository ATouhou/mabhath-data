فظ1
فَظَّ, (Msb,) sec. pers. فَظِظْتَ, (S, M, Msb,)
inf. n. فَظَاظَةٌ (S, M, Msb, K) and فَظَظٌ, (M, K,)
but the former is the more common because of the
difficulty of pronouncing the doubled letter in the
latter, (M,) and ↓ فِظَاظٌ is syn. with these, (M, K,)
and so is ↓ فَظَاظٌ, but these two are simple substs.,
(M,) He (a man) was, or became, such as is
termed فَظٌّ [i. e. rough, coarse, rude, &c., as expl.
below]; (S, M, Msb, K; *) or rough, &c., so as
to be unduly feared. (Msb.)
-A2-  فَظَّةُ, (M, K,)
aor.
فَظُ3َ, inf. n. فَظٌّ; (TK;) and ↓ افتظّهُ; (M, K;)
He let it out, namely the water termed فَظٌّ, by
cutting open the stomach [of a camel]: (M, TA:)
or he pressed it, or squeezed it, out, namely the
water so termed, (M, K,) from the stomach, (M,
TA,) and drank it: (TK:) and كَرِشَ بَعِيرٍ ↓ افتظّ
he slaughtered a camel, and pressed out, or squeezed
out, the water of its stomach, and strained it:
(Esh-Sháfi'ee, T:) or ↓ افتظّ signifies he gave his
camel to drink, then bound his mouth in order that
he might not ruminate, and, when attacked by
thirst, cut open his belly, and pressed out, or
squeezed out, the fluid of the feces of his stomach,
and drank it: (S:) and الكَرِشَ ↓ أَفْظَظْتُ I pressed
out, or squeezed out, the water of the stomach.

-b2-  افظّهُ, inf. n. إِفْظَاظٌ, also signifies He turned him back, or away, from the object
of his desire. (TA.) ―

eye of the needle: [if the affixed pronoun refer
to the eye of the needle, the meaning is, He inserted the thread into it: if to the thread, he
inserted it into the eye of the needle:] mentioned

إِفْتَظَ3َ see فَظَّهُ, in three places.
فَظٌّ, applied to a man, (T, S, M, &c.,) Rough;
coarse; rude; unkind; hard; churlish; uncivil;
surly; hard to deal with; incompliant; unobsequious; (S, M, O, K, and Bd in iii. 153;) evil
in disposition; illnatured; (O, K, and Bd and
Jel ubi suprà;) hard-hearted; hard, or severe;
rough, coarse, or the like, so as to be unduly
feared; (Msb;) rough, or coarse, in speech; (Lth,
T, M, K;) sour, or austere, therein: (Lth:) [said
in the T to be from the same word in the sense
next following; but accord. to the M, the reverse
seems to be the case:] pl. أَفْظَاظٌ. (M.) You say,
إِنَّهُ لَفَظٌّ بَظٌّ [Verily he is rough, coarse, or the like];
the latter word being an imitative sequent; (M,
K;) as such we regard it because Th, who mentions it, does not explan it; (M;) and ↓ فَظِيظٌ
بَظِيظٌ [app. signifies the same]. (TA in art. بظ.)
-A2-  Also The water of the stomach [of a camel],
(T, S, K,) which is pressed, or squeezed, out, and
drunk, (T, K,) on an occasion of want of water,
(T,) in the waterless deserts; (T, K;) the water
that comes forth from the stomach [of a camel];
because it is a coarse, or bitter, beverage: (M:)
it may not be used for the purpose of religious
purification: (Esh-Sháfi'ee, T:) also, the urine of
horses which is drunk on an occasion of thirst: pl.
فُظُوظٌ: thus used by Mutemmem Ibn-Nuweyreh.
(M, L.)
فَظَاظٌ and فِظَاظٌ: see 1, first sentence.
فَظِيظٌ The seminal fluid of a woman: or of a
stallion: (M, K:) so they assert: but it is not
of established authority: (M:) and so say IDrd
and Fr: (TA:) accord. to Kr, the seminal fluid
of a stallion, in a she-camel's womb: (M, * TA:)
or this is the explanation given by Fr: (T:) and
↓ فُظَاظَةٌ is of the measure فُعَالَةٌ from this word;
(K;) as signifying the seminal fluid of a stallion,
or the water of the stomach; but El-Khattábee
disallows the latter meaning; or from فَظٌّ: (TA:)
and hence the saying of 'Áïsheh to Marwán, وَلٰكِنَّ
اللّٰهَ لَعَنَ أَبَاكَ وَأَنْتَ فِى صُلْبِهِ فَأَنْتَ فُظَاظَةٌ مِنْ لَعْنَةِ
اللّٰهِ [But God cursed thy father when thou wast
essentially in his loins; so thou art seed of the
object of the curse of God]; (K;) i. e., نُطْفَةٌ مِنْهَا;
(TA;) or عُصَارَةٌ مِنْهَا [produce thereof, as though
expressed therefrom]: (Z:) or, accord. to one
relation, فُضُضٌ; (K;) pl. of فَضِيضٌ, which means
water such as is termed غَرِيض: or, accord. to
another relation, فَضَضٌ, meaning نُطْفَةٌ: and
accord. to another, فَضِيضٌ. (TA.)
-A2-  See also
فَظٌّ.
فُظَاظَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
هُوَ أَفْظُّ مِنْ فُلَانٍ He is [more rough, coarse,
rude, or the like, (see فَظٌّ,) or] more difficult in
disposition, evil in disposition, illnatured, or perverse, than such a one. (TA.)
