فردوسQ. 1
فَرْدَسَهُ, (O, K,) inf. n. فَرْدَسَةٌ, (Kr, M, O,)
He threw him down, prostrate, on the ground,
(Kr, M, O, K,) in an evil, or abominable, manner:
(Kr, M, O:) and flung him upon the ground; lit.,
smote with him the ground. (O, K.) ―
-b2-  And فَرْدَسَ
الجُلَّةَ He filled, or stuffed, compactly, the [receptacle for dates, termed] جُلَّة. (AA, O, * K.)
فَرْدَسَةٌ Width; amplitude: (M, O, Msb, K:)
whence is derived the word فِرْدَوْسٌ, (Msb, K,)
accord. to Fr. (Msb.)
فِرْدَوْسٌ A garden: (S, Msb:) so in the Greek
language [
παράδεισο�]: (M:) or a garden comprising everything that is in gardens: (Zj, M, A,
O, K:) such is the proper signification; (Zj, M,
O;) and so with the people of every language:
(Zj, M:) and containing grape-vines: (Fr, O, K:)
or a garden in which are grape-vines: (IAmb, M,
Msb:) or a place in which are grape-vines: (TA:)
or an ample, beautiful garden: (A:) or a garden
comprising grape-vines and palm-trees: (Bd in
xviii. 107:) or with the Arabs it signifies a
valley abounding with herbage, like a garden:
(M:) or a valley, (Zj, Msb,) or valleys, (O, K,)
producing various sorts of plants or herbage: (Zj,
O, Msb, K:) in the K, for الأَوْدِيَةُ الَّتِى تُنْبِتُ, we
should read مِنَ الأَوْدِيَةِ الَّتِى تُنْبِتُ; (TK;) [or
rather, مِنَ الأَوْدِيَةِ مَا يُنْبِتُ, as in the Msb:] or a
meadow; syn. رَوْضَةٌ: (Seer, M:) and the greenness of grapes (أَعْنَاب), (so in a copy of the M,)
or of herbs (أَعْشَاب): (so in the TA:) masc. and
fem.: (Msb:) sometimes the latter; (K;) as in
the Kur xxiii. 11, because, by الفِرْدَوْسَ is there
meant الجَنَّةَ: (O, TA:) it is an Arabic word, (S,
O, Msb, K,) accord. to Fr, (S, O, Msb,) occurring in a verse cited voce ثَوَابٌ, which is by
Hassán Ibn-Thábit, (O,) derived from فَرْدَسَةٌ,
meaning “ width ” or “ amplitude,” (Msb, K, *)
accord. to Fr: (Msb:) or it is Greek, (Zj, O,
Msb, K,) transferred to the Arabic language;
(Zj, O, Msb;) [i. e., arabicised: but as it occurs
in the Kur (xviii. 107 and xxiii. 11), this is contr.
to the opinion of Esh-Sháfi'ee and others, who
deny that any arabicized word occurs therein:
(see سُنْدُسٌ:)] or it is Syriac: (Zj, O, K:) the
pl. is فَرَادِيسُ; (A, TA;) which is applied by the
people of Syria to gardens and grape-vines. (TA.)
―
-b2-  Hence, (Bd in xviii. 107,) الفِرْدَوْسُ [Paradise: or] a garden of trees, or walled garden,
(حَدِيقَةٌ,) in الجَنَّة [or Paradise]: (S:) or the
highest of the stages of الجَنَّة: (Bd, ubi suprà:)
or the middle and highest part of الجَنَّة. (Jel,
ibid.)
فُرْدُوسٌ Increase (نَزَل, in the CK نُزُل,) that is
in طَعَام [i. e. wheat]: (O, K:) mentioned by
IDrd, as heard from some persons of ElBahreyn. (O.)
فُرَادِسٌ A man big in the bones. (Ibn-'Abbád,
O, K.)

(Lth, S, M.) ―
-b2-  A wide breast. (O, K.) ―
