فخم1
فَخُمَ, aor.
فَخُمَ, (S, M, K, &c.,) inf. n. فَخَامَةٌ,
(S, &c.,) He (a man, S) was, or became, large,
big, bulky, or thick. (S, M, K, &c.) ―
-b2-  And He
was, or became, great in respect of estimation,
rank, or quality. (So accord. to an explanation
of the inf. n. in the KL [agreeably with an explanation of the epithet فَخْمٌ].) See also مُفَخَّمٌ,
below. ―
-b3-  And one says also فَخُمَ الأَمْرُ [meaning
Great in estimation is the thing or affair or event
or case!]. (K in art. بخ, in which see بَخْ.)

تَفْخِيمٌ is syn. with تَعْظِيمٌ [as signifying The
magnifying a man, honouring him, or treating
him with respect or reverence or veneration]: (S,
K, TA:) one says, أَتَيْنَا فُلَانًا فَفَخَّمْنَاهُ meaning
[We came to such a one] and we magnified him,
or honoured him, and paid him high respect: and
↓ تفخّمهُ signifies [the same as فخّمهُ, i. e.] He
magnified him, or honoured him, &c.; syn. أَجَلَّهُ,
and عَظَّمَهُ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  تَفْخِيمُ الحَرْفِ is the contr.
of إِمَالَتُهُ [i. e. it signifies The pronouncing of the
word with the broad sound of the lengthened fet-h
(approaching to the sound of “ a ” in our word
“ ball ”)]: (S:) [and also with a full sound of the
letter ل:] or التَّفْخِيمُ is the abstaining from
الإِمَالَة; (K, and Kull p. 127;) and the contr. of
التَّرْقِيقُ; i. e. i. q. التَّغْلِيظُ; and signifies the inclining of ا towards the place of utterance of و, as
in the word الصَّلَوةُ; and the uttering of ل from
the lower part of the tongue [i. e. with the tongue
turned up], as in the word اَللّٰه [i. e. in the word
اللّٰه not immediately preceded by a kesreh]: (Kull
ubi suprà:) it is [predominantly] peculiar to the
people of El-Hijáz, like as الامالة is to the tribe of
Temeem. (TA.)
-A2-  See also what next follows.

تَفَخَّمَ [تفخّم signifies He magnified, or aggrandized, himself; as is shown by a verse cited in
the first paragraph of art. فيل; in which verse it
is said in the M that ↓ فَخَّمُوا means تَفَخَّمُوا.
-A2-
And it is also trans., like 2:] see 2, first sentence.
فَخْمٌ [seems to signify primarily Large, big,
bulky, or thick. And hence,] A man having much
flesh in the balls, or elevated parts, of the cheeks.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  [And predominantly,] Great in estimation, rank, or quality; (S, K, TA;) applied to a
man: (S, TA:) pl. فِخَامٌ: the fem. is فَخْمَةٌ.
(TA.) And it is likewise applied to حَسَب [or
grounds of pretension to respect or honour].
(TA.) ―
-b3-  And to speech, or diction, (مَنْطِق,)
meaning Strong; sound, or correct; or chaste,
clear, or eloquent, and comprehensive; syn. جَزْلٌ.
(S, K.)
فَخْمَةٌ fem. of فَخْمٌ [q. v.]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And A
great army or military force. (TA.)
فُخَمِيَّةٌ, like جُهَنِيَّةٌ, (so in the JK, K, and TA,
[in the CK and my MS. copy of the K فُخَيْمَة,
like جُهَيْنَة,]) Self-magnification, pride, or haughtiness, and assumption of superiority. (JK, K, TA.)
فَيْخَمَانٌ A person of authority, (TA,) one held
in honour, from whose judgment events are made
to proceed, and without whom no affair is decided.
(K, TA. [In the explanation of this word in the
CK, يَصْدُرُ is a mistranscription for يُصْدَرُ.])
أَفْخَمُ i. q. أَعْظَمُ [as meaning Most, or very,
great in estimation, rank, or quality; applied to
a man]. (TA.)
مُفَخَّمٌ, occurring in a trad., as an epithet applied to the Prophet, means Magnified, honoured,
or regarded with respect or reverence or veneration, in the minds and the eyes [of others: and so
it means when applied in a general manner]: not
largeness in his bodily make: or, as some say, it
means [characterized by] ↓ فَخَامَة in his face, [i. e.]
its nobleness, and fulness, with beauty, or comeliness, and a quality inspiring reverence or veneration. (TA.)
