فسق1
فَسَقَ is said to signify primarily It (a thing)
went forth, from another thing, in a bad, or corrupt, manner. (Msb.) One says, فَسَقَتِ الرُّطَبَةُ,
(S, O, Msb,) or فَسَقَتِ الرُّطَبَةُ عَنْ قِشْرِهَا, (K,) The
fresh ripe date came forth from its skin; (S, O,
Msb, K;) as also ↓ انفسقت: (IDrd, O, K:) and
in like manner فَسَقَ is said of anything as meaning it came forth from its integument: so says EsSarakustee. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  [Hence] فَسَقَ, aor.
فَسُقَ and
فَسِقَ,
(S, O, Msb, K) the latter aor. mentioned by Akh,
(S, O, Msb,) inf. n. فُسُوقٌ (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K)
and فِسْقٌ, (S, O, K,) or this latter is a simple
subst.; (Msb;) and likewise فَسُقَ, like كَرُمَ, (K,
TA,) mentioned by Lh, but not known by Ks;
(TA;) He went forth from, departed from, or
quitted, (Mgh, Msb, K,) the right way, (Mgh, K,)
or the way of truth, (K,) and the limits of the law,
(Mgh,) [or the bounds of] obedience; (Msb;) he
forsook, relinquished, or neglected, the command of
God; he disobeyed; (K;) or i. q. فَجَرَ [meaning
as above; or he transgressed; or acted unrighteously, sinfully, wickedly, vitiously, or immorally].
(S, O, K. [See also فِسْقٌ below.]) فَسَقَ عَنْ أَمْرِرَبِّهِ
(in the Kur [xviii. 48], O, TA) means He departed (خَرَجَ) from the command of his Lord:
(Th, S, O, K:) or from the obeying [of the command] of his Lord: (Fr, O, TA:) and Akh says
that this phrase is like اِتَّخَمَ عن الطَّعامِ, (S, O,)
meaning عَنْ مَأْكَلِهِ, (S,) or عَنْ أَكْلِهِ الطَّعَامَ; but
Th says that there is no need of this [explanation]:
or, accord. to AO, it means he declined, or deviated, from obeying the command of his Lord:
(O:) for فَسَقَ signifies also he declined, or deviated:
(K:) and hence the saying, فَسَقَتِ الرِّكَابُ عَنْ قَصْدِ
السَّبِيلِ i. e. [The ridden camels] declined [from
the right direction of the way]. (TA.) Sometimes
فُسُوقٌ may mean The believing in a plurality of
gods: and it may mean the committing sin. (A
Heyth, O.) And it is said to mean The calling
one another by names of reproach: (Zj, * Mgh,
TA:) or the saying “ O Jew,” and “ O Christian,” after one has become a believer: thus in
the Kur xlix. 11. (TA.) ―
-b3-  One says also, فَسَقَ فِى
الدُّنْيَا, inf. n. فِسْقٌ, meaning He had a wide, or an
ample, range in respect of worldly things, and
made them light and easy to himself, being without restraint in his management of them, not
making them strait to him. (Ktr, Sh, TA.) ―
-b4-
And فَسَقَ مَالَهُ He made away with his property;
and disposed of it, or spent it. (TA.)
2
تَفْسِيقٌ is the contr. of تَعْدِيلٌ: (O, K, TA:)
one says فسّقهُ, (O, TA,) inf. n. تَفْسِيقٌ, (TA,) He
(the judge) pronounced him to be characterized by
فِسْق [q. v.]: (O, TA:) he attributed to him فِسْق.
(TA.)
7
إِنْفَسَقَ see 1, second sentence. ―
-b2-  [Hence,] انفسق
مِنَ الخَيْرِ, said of the فَاسِق, He divested himself,
or became divested, of good. IDrd, O.)
فِسْقٌ is an inf. n., (S, O, K,) or a simple subst.,
(Msb,) from فَسَقَ [q. v]: (S, O, Msb, K:) unless
as signifying [simply] A going forth, or a departure, it is said to be a word unknown before ElIslám, and to have become so much used in its
legal acceptation as to be, when so used, conventionally regarded as proper (MF, TA:) [thus
used,] it signifies a going forth, or departure, from
the right way, (K, TA,) which is said to be the
primary meaning, (TA,) or from the way of truth;
(K, TA;) or from the truth, or that which is
right, as in the phrase وَإِنَّهُ لَفِسْقٌ, (O, K, [in the
CK لَفَسِقٌ, a strange mistake,]) in the Kur [vi.
121]; (O;) or a relinquishment, or neglect, of the
command of God; (Lth, O, K;) and an inclining
to disobedience; (Lth, O;) or also disobedience
[itself]; (K;) or i. q. فُجُورٌ [meaning as above;
or transgression; or unrighteous, sinful, wicked,
vitious, or immoral, conduct]: (O, K:) it is said
by El-Isbahánee to be a more general term than
كُفْرٌ; applying to few sins, misdeeds, transgressions, or acts of disobedience, or to little thereof;
and also, to many, or much thereof; but is commonly known as applying to the latter: and it is
related on the authority of Málik that in the Kur
vi. 146 it means such as is slaughtered: (TA:)
[being used as a subst.,] it sometimes has a pl.,
which is فُسُوقٌ. (TA.)
فُسَقٌ (Lth, O, K) and ↓ فِسِّيقٌ, (Lth, S, O, K,)
applied to a man, Always characterized by فِسْق.
(Lth, S, O, K.) ―
-b2-  يَافُسَقُ means يَا أَيُّهَا الفَاسِقُ
[O thou فَاسِق]; (S, O, K;) like يَا خُبَثُ, meaning يَا أَيُّهَا انخَبِيثُ; فُسَقُ being determinate, as is
shown by their saying يَا فُسَقُ الخَبِيثُ, thus prefixing ال to خبيث: (S, O:) and to a woman they
say ↓ يَا فَسَاقِ, like قَطَامِ, (S, O, K,) meaning
يَا فَاسِقَةُ (K) [or rather يَا أَيُّهَا الفَاسِقَةُ].
فَسْقِيَّةٌ, with fet-h, [often pronounced فِسْقِيَّة,] a
post-classical word, [arabicized, from the Lat.
“ piscina,”] i. q. مُتَوَضَّأٌ [properly A place, here
meaning a tank, or basin, in which the ablution
termed وُضُوْء is performed: now commonly applied
to a basin, or shallow pool, of water, in the court
of a house, or in a room, generally having in the
centre a fountain that throws up water:] pl.
فَسَاقِيُّ. (TA.)
فَسَاقِ: see فُسَقٌ
فِسِّيقٌ: see فُسَقٌ
فَاسِقٌ Going forth, or departing, or one who
goes forth, or departs, [from the right way, or the
way of truth, and the limits of the law, or] from
[the bounds of] obedience; (Msb;) disobedient [to
God]; (Mgh, TA;) [transgressing, or a transgressor; unrighteous, sinful, wicked, vitious, or
immoral;] mostly applied to one who has taken
upon himself to observe what the law ordains, and
has acknowledged its authority, and then fallen
short of observance in respect of all, or of some, of
its ordinances: and when the person fundamentally, or utterly, an unbeliever is thus termed, it
is because he falls short of observing the ordinance
that the intellect renders obligatory on him and
that the natural constitution with which he was
created in his mother's womb requires to be conceded; hence the believer is contrasted with him
in the Kur xxxii. 18; so فَاسِقٌ is a more general
term than كَافِرٌ; and ظَالِمٌ is a more general term
than فَاسِقٌ: (El-Isbahánee, TA:) accord. to IDrd,
(O,) the فَاسِق is thus called because of his divesting himself, or becoming divested, of good: (O,
K:) the word has not been heard in the speech
of the people of the Time of Ignorance, (IAar,
S, O, Msb, K,) nor in their poetry, (IAar, S, O,
K,) though it is an Arabic word, (IAar, S, O,
Msb, K,) and a chaste one, and the Kur-án has
used it: (IAar, Msb:) the pl. is فَسَقَةٌ and فُسَّاقٌ:
(Msb:) فَوَاسِقُ, [pl. of فَاسِقَةٌ,] applied to women,
signifies فَوَاجِرُ [generally meaning adulteresses, or
fornicatresses]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  The five animals, or
living things, (الحَيَوَانَاتُ الخَمْسُ, [specified voce
حَيَوَانٌ,]) are metaphorically termed فَوَاسِقُ [as
though meaning (tropical:)  Transgressors] (Mgh, Msb) because of their noxiousness, (Mgh,) or because of
their much, or frequent, noxiousness and harmfulness, so that they may be killed in the case of
freedom from إِحْرَام and in the state of إِحْرَام, and
in prayer, which is not rendered ineffectual thereby:
(Msb:) or because of their being out of the pale
of inviolability: or, as some [unreasonably] say,
because the eating of them is forbidden. (Mgh.)
فَاسِقِيَّةٌ A certain mode of attiring oneself with
the turban. (Z, O, K.) One says, تَعَمَّمَ فُلَانٌ
الفَاسِقيَّةَ [Such a one attired himself with the turban
in the mode termed الفاسقيّة]. (TA.)
الفُوَيْسِقَةُ The rat, or mouse; syn. الفَأْرَةُ: (S, O,
K:) so called because it comes forth from its hole
upon people: (O, K:) or, accord. to Z, because
it does mischief in houses: and it is said in a trad.
that it is to be killed: the word is the dim. of فَاسِقَةٌ.
(TA.)
أَفْسَقُ [More, or most, characterized by فِسْق].
The Arabs say, لَعَنَ اللّٰهُ أَفْسَقِى وأَفْسَقَكَ, meaning,
الأَفْسَقَ مِنَّا [i. e. May God curse the more characterized by فِسْق, of us, or of me and thee]. (Fr, O.)
