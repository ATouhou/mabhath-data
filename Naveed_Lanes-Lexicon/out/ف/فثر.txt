فثرفَاثُورٌ A [basin such as is termed] طَسْت; (M, L,
K;) thus it means with the vulgar: (L:) or a
طَسْت of gold, or of silver: (O:) or the طَسْتَخَان,
(T, K,) or طَشْتَخَان, (O, and so in some copies
of the K,) [i. e. a large circular tray, of brass or
other metal, which serves as a table for food, being
generally placed upon a stool, the persons who
eat sitting on the floor]; (Lth, T, Z, O, K;)
thus it means with the vulgar: (Lth, T, Z, O:)
or a خِوَان [or table upon which food is eaten],
made of marble, (Lth, T, S, M, O, K,) by the
people of Syria, who thus call it, (Lth, T, O,) or
of silver, (T, S, M,) and the like, (S,) or of gold:
(M, K:) or of any kind accord. to some: (TA:)
or a جَام [q. v.] of silver, (T, Nh, TA,) or of gold:
(Nh, TA:) [but this seems to be virtually a repetition; for it is said that] ↓ فَاثُورِيَّةٌ, occurring in
a verse of Lebeed, means أَخْوِنَةٌ [pl. of pauc. of
خِوَانٌ] (T, O) and جَامَاتٌ [which is pl. of جَامٌ
accord. to IAar, or of جَامَةٌ accord. to IB, who
holds جَامٌ to be likewise a pl. of جَامَةٌ]: (T:)
فَاثُورٌ is a word of the people of Syria and ElJezeereh: (M:) and it signifies (S, O, L) in the
dial. of the people of El-Jezeereh, (L,) a مَائِدَة
[sometimes meaning table in an absolute sense,
but properly one with food upon it]: (S, O, L:)
[hence,] one says, هُمْ عَلَى فَاثُورٍ وَاحِدٍ (Lth, T, S,
M, O, L, TA) i. e. عَلَى مَائِدَةٍ وَاحِدَةٍ, (S, O, L,
TA,) and مَنْزِلَةٍ وَاحِدَةٍ, (S, O, TA,) and بَسَاطٍ
وَاحِدٍ, (O, TA, [in both of which the former word
is without any vowel-sign to the ب so that it
may be either بَسَاطٍ or بِسَاطٍ,]) or بَسْطٍ واحدٍ, (TT
as from the M,) or as though meaning على بساطٍ
واحدٍ, thus expl. by Lth, as said of the people of
Syria and El-Jezeereh: (TT as from the T:) [it
means, app., They are living upon one kind of
fare; upon one footing; upon one level or stratum:]
in the copies of the K, [or in the generality of the
copies thereof,] الفَاثُورُ is expl. as signifying المَنْزِلَةُ
and النَّشَاطُ; but النشاط is a mistake for البساط.
(TA. [My MS. copy of the K has the right
reading (البساط), without any trace of alteration.])
