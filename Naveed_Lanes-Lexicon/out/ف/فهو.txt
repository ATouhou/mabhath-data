(JK,) I was unmindful, forgetful, or neglectful,
of it. (JK, K.) ―
-b2-  ISd says, فَهَا فُؤَادُهُ is like
هَفَا, [which, said of the heart, accord. to explanations in the TA in art. هفو, means It fluttered,
or palpitated: and it was flurried by reason of
grief or of beating:] and no inf. n. of it has been
heard, therefore I think it to be formed by transposition. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And فَهَا signifies also He
spoke clearly, or distinctly, after doing the contrary thereof. (TA.)

فَاهٍ, formed by transposition from فَائِهٌ, A man
who reveals, or discloses, everything that is in his
mind; like فَاوُوهَةٌ; (Fr, in S and TA, art. فوه;)
and so فَاهٌ: (Fr, in TA ibid.:) and فَاهٍ بِجُوعِهِ one
who reveals his hunger. (TA ibid.)
[
الافهيانِ, said by Freytag to signify The elephant
and the buffalo, is a mistranscription for الأَقْهَبَانِ.]
أَفْهَآءٌ [a pl. of which the sing. is not mentioned]
i. q. بُلْهٌ [pl. of أَبْلَهُ; signifying Heedless; or
