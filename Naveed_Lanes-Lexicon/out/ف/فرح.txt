transitory, or fleeting, not lasting, as is the case
in bodily and worldly pleasures. See فَرَحٌ.] ―

-b3-  And He, or it, made him to
exult, or rejoice above measure; or to exult greatly,
and to behave insolently and unthankfully, or ungratefully. (Msb, K.)
-A2-  Also He, or it, grieved

S, TA, or a thing, TA) burdened him, burdened
him heavily, or overburdened him. (AA, S, K,
TA.)
فَرَحٌ [inf. n. of فَرِحَ, q. v.: as a simple subst.,]
Joy, mirth, or gladness; or happiness; (S, L,
Msb, K;) syn. سُرُورٌ; (Msb, K;) contr. of حُزْنٌ,
(L,) and of تَرَحٌ: (S and A in art ترح:) or a sensation of lightness of the heart: (Th, TA:) or dilatation of the bosom with delight, or pleasure, of
short continuance, transitory, or fleeting, not lasting, as is the case in bodily and worldly pleasures;
whereas سُرُورٌ is dilatation of the bosom with

-b6-  In the saying of Muteea Ibn-Iyás,
قَدْ ظَفِرَ الحُزْنُ بِالسُّرُورِ وَقَدْ
أُدِيلَ مَكْرُوهُنَا مِنَ الفَرَحِ
[Sorrow, or sadness, has overcome happiness, and
the object of our dislike, or hatred, has been given
a turn to prevail over the object of our love], by
مِنَ الفَرَحِ he means مِنَ المَفْرُوحِ بِهِ, i. e. المَحْبُوبِ.
(Ham p. 391.)
فَرُحٌ: see the paragraph here following.
فَرِحٌ and ↓ فَرْحَانُ (Msb, K) and ↓ فَرُحٌ, as in
some copies of the K and in the L and other
lexicons, or ↓ فَرُوحٌ, as in other copies and mentioned by IJ, (TA,) and ↓ فَارِحٌ and ↓ مَفْرُوحٌ, (K,)
the last mentioned by IJ; (TA;) fem. [of the
first] فَرِحَةٌ and [of the second] فَرْحَى (Msb, K)
and فَرْحَانَةٌ, (K,) but of the correctness of this last
ISd was not certain: (TA:) pl. [of the first]
فَرِحُونَ (S, Msb) and [of the second] فَرَاحَى and
فَرْحَى: (K, TA:) Rejoicing, joyful, or glad; or
happy: (Msb, K:) [or experiencing a sensation
of lightness in the heart: or having the bosom
dilated with delight, or pleasure, of short continuance, transitory, or fleeting, not lasting, as is
the case in bodily and worldly pleasures. See فَرَحٌ.]
Hence, in the Kur [iii. 164], فَرِحِينَ بِمَا آتَاهُمُ
اللّٰهُ مِنْ فَضْلِهِ [Rejoicing by reason of that which
God has given them of his bounty]. (Msb.) ―
-b2-
And Well pleased, or content: whence, in the Kur
[xxiii. 55 and xxx. 31], كُلُّ حِزْبٍ بِمَا لَدَيْهِمْ فَرِحُونَ
[Every sect is well pleased, or content, with that
religion which it has]. (Msb.) ―
-b3-  And Exulting,
or rejoicing above measure; or exulting greatly,
and behaving insolently and unthankfully, or ungratefully: (S, Msb, K:) whence, in the Kur
[xxviii. 76], إِنَّ اللّٰهَ لَا يُحِبُّ الفَرِحِينَ [Verily God
does not love those who exult, or rejoice above
measure; &c.]. (S, Msb.)
فَرْحَةٌ [A joy, or gladness; or a happiness]: see
an ex. voce تَرْحَةٌ. ―
-b2-  See also the next paragraph,
in two places.
فُرْحَةٌ A cause of joy or gladness, or of happiness; a thing whereby one is made joyful or glad,
or happy; as also ↓ فَرْحَةٌ; syn. مَسَرَّةٌ. (K.) ―
-b2-
And A thing that thou givest to him that rejoices
thee; (L, K;) a recompense that thou givest him;
(L;) [as also ↓ فَرْحَةٌ; for] you say, لَكَ عِنْدِى
فَرْحَةٌ إِنْ بَشَّرْتَنِى, (S, A, [in one of my copies of
the S أَىْ بَشَّرْتَنِى, as though this were an explanation, but the former is the right reading,]) and
فُرْحَةٌ, (S,) meaning بُشْرَى [i. e. There is for thee,
with me, a gift for announcing a joyful event, if
thou announce to me such an event]. (A.)
فَرْحَانُ; fem. فَرْحَى, and accord. to the K فَرْحَانَةٌ
also: see فَرِحٌ.
فَرْحَانَةٌ White كَمْأَة [or truffles]: (K:) from
Kr: but ISd states the word transmitted to him
to be with ق [i. e. قُرْحَانٌ, of which قُرْحَانَةٌ is mentioned as a n. un.]. (L, TA.)
فَرُوحٌ: see فَرِحٌ.
فَارِحٌ: see فَرِحٌ.
مُفْرَحٌ A man burdened, or burdened heavily, or
overburdened, by debt, (A'Obeyd, S, TA,) or by
a fine, or the like, and unable to pay it: (A'Obeyd,
TA:) or needy, or in want; overcome; and poor:
(K:) or poor, possessing no property: (TA:) one
who is not known to have any kinsfolk or near
relations; (K, TA;) but in a trad. in which it
occurs in this sense as related by some, it is, as
others relate the trad., with ج; and so in the
sense next following: (TA:) and a slain person
found between two towns or villages. (K.) In the
trad. in which it is said لاَ يُتْرَكُ فِى الإِسْلَامِ مُفْرَحٌ
it has the first of the significations mentioned
above accord. to A'Obeyd [i. e. the saying means
One who is burdened, or burdened heavily, or overburdened, by debt, &c., shall not be left unbefriended
among the Muslims]. (TA.) And in the writing
that the Apostle of God wrote [as a covenant]
between the Muhájirs and the Ansár were the
words, لاَيَتْرُكُوا مُفْرَحاً حَتَّى يُعِينُوهُ عَلَى مَا كَانَ
مِنْ عَقْلٍ أَوْ فِدَآءٍ, in which مُفْرَحاً means مَفْدُوحاً,
(Ez-Zuhree, As, S,) i. e. [They shall not leave]
one who is burdened, or burdened heavily, or overburdened, by debt, [until they aid him to acquit
himself of what has become incumbent on him, of
a bloodwit or a ransom,] meaning that his debt
shall be paid for him from the treasury of the
state: so says As; and he disallowed the saying
[in this case] مُفْرَجٌ, [q. v.,] with ج. (S.)
مُفْرِحٌ A thing that makes joyful or glad, or
that makes happy: (T, L:) [and بِهِ ↓ مَفْرُوحٌ a
thing by which one is made joyful or glad, or by
which one is made happy:] one says, مَا يَسُرُّنِى
بِهِ مُفْرِحٌ, (As, T, S, L,) and بِهِ ↓ مَفْرُوحٌ, for which
one should not say مَفْرُوحٌ [alone], (As, S,) [i. e.
Nothing that makes joyful &c., and by which one
is made joyful &c., renders me happy by means of
it,] relating to an affair, or event. (S.) [See also
فُرْحَةٌ.]
مُفَرِّحٌ A certain well-known [exhilarating] medicine; (S, K;) a certain medicine which is given
to drink to him who is in grief, and in consequence
of which he becomes happy; thus called by the
physicians, and by others called سُلْوَانٌ. (S in art.
سلو.)
مِفْرَاحٌ One who rejoices much, or often: (K:)
or one who rejoices [app. much] whenever fortune
renders him happy. (S.)
