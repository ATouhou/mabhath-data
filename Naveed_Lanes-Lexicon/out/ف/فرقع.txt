فرقعQ. 1
فَرْقَعَ الأَصَابِعَ i. q. نَقَّضَهَا, (S, * O, * K, [in
copies of the K written نَقَضَهَا, but correctly with

inf. n. فَرْقَعَةٌ i. q. تَنْقِيضٌ (S, O) and تَفْقِيعٌ, (TA,)
[He cracked the joints of his fingers;] i. e. he
pressed his fingers so that a sound was heard to
proceed from their joints: (TA:) the doing of
which is forbidden, (O, TA,) in prayer. (TA.
[See also 2 in art. فقع.]) And one says, سَمِعْتُ
فَرْقَعَةً لِرَجُلٍ and صَرْقَعَةً [I heard a cracking of the
joints of the fingers of a man]: both signify the
same. (TA.) ―

He ran vehemently, (O, K, TA,) going back, or
retreating: so in the Tekmileh. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And
فِرْقَاعٌ (as an inf. n. of which the verb is فَرْقَعَ, TK)
signifies The emitting of wind from the anus with
a sound: (O, K:) mentioned by IDrd as from

Q. 2
تَفَرْقَعَتْ الأَصَابِعُ The fingers produced a
sound or sounds [by their joints' being cracked];
(O;) quasi-pass. of 1 in the first of the senses
expl. above; (S, K;) as also ↓ اِفْرَنْقَعَت, (K,
TA,) inf. n. اِفْرِنْقَاعُ and [quasi-inf. n., being app.
the inf. n. in this case of فُرْقِعَت,] ↓ فَرْقَعَةٌ, (TA,)
[and this is app. what is meant by its being said
that] ↓ الاِفْرِنْقَاعُ is [syn. with] الفَرْقَعَةُ. (K.) ―
-b2-
Accord. to IDrd, تَفَرْقُعٌ signifies The sounding of
two things striking against each other. (O.) ―
-b3-
And تفرقع الرَّجُلُ The man drew himself together,

Q. 3
إِفْرَنْقَعَ see Q. 2, in two places. ―
-b2-  الاِفْرِنْقَاعُ also
signifies The withdrawing, or removing, and going
away, from a thing (عَنْ شَىْءٍ); (K;) and the
dispersing of itself, or becoming dispersed. (IAth,
TA.) اِفْرَنْقِعُوا عَنِّى, a phrase used by 'Eesà Ibn-
'Omar, (S, O,) to people who had congregated
about him on an occasion of his having fallen
from his ass, (O,) means Withdraw ye, or remove,
(S,) or disperse yourselves, (O,) from me, (S,) and
go away. (S, O.) And 'Eesà Ibn-'Omar is related to have read, [in the Kur xxxiv. 22,] حَتَّى
إِذَا افْرَنْقَعَ عَنْ قُلُوبِهِمْ; meaning, كُشِفَ; [الفَزَعُ,
or the like, being understood;] but the common
reading is فُزِّعَ, q. v. (TA.)
الفُرْقَعَةَ The اِسْت [here app. meaning anus
(see 1)]; (Lth, IAar, K;) of the dial. of ElYemen: (O:) also called القُرْفُعَةُ. (TA.)
