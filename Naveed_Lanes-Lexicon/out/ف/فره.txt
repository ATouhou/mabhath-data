فَرُهَ, aor.

(K) [and app. also فُرُوهَةٌ, expl. below as a simple
subst.], He was, or became, skilled, or skilful. (S,
K.) ―
-b2-  And فَرُهَ and فَرَهَ, aor. of each
فَرُهَ, [inf. n.
app. فُرُوهَةٌ and فَرَاهَةٌ and فَرَاهِيَةٌ, expl. below as
simple substs.,] said of a horse or similar beast,
&c., He was, or became, brisk, lively, sprightly,
active, agile, or light. (Msb.) ―
-b3-  [And فَرُهَ, inf. n.
فَرَاهَةٌ, (of which see an explanation below,) probably signifies He was, or became, beautiful,
comely, pretty, or elegant; like صَبُحَ, inf. n.
صَبَاحَةٌ.] ―
-b4-  And فَرِهَ, (S, K,) aor.
فَرَهَ, (K,) inf. n.
فَرَهٌ, (TK,) He exulted, or rejoiced above measure;
or he exulted greatly, and behaved insolently and
unthankfully, or ungratefully: (S, K:) the ه in
this verb, accord. to Fr, is substituted for the ح
in فَرِحَ, which has this meaning. (TA.)

فَرَّهَ see what next follows.

أَفْرَهَت She (a camel) brought forth [young
ones such as are termed] فُرْهٌ (S) or فُرَّهٌ (K) [i. e.
such as were brisk, lively, sprightly, active, agile,
or light]; as also ↓ فرّهت, inf. n. تَفْرِيهٌ. (K.) ―
-b2-
And She (a woman) brought forth beautiful
children. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And افره He (a man) took
for himself a غُلَام [i. e. youth, young man, or
male slave,] such as is termed فَارِهٌ (IAar, K)
meaning beautiful, or comely, of countenance.
(IAar, TA.)

هُوَ يَسْتَفْرِهُ الأَفْرَاسَ means يَسْتَكْرِمُهَا [i. e. He
seeks the horses, or mares, that are of generous
race]: (aK, TA:) and the like is said in the A,
but with الدَّوَابَّ in the place of الافراس. (TA.)
فَرِهٌ [part. n. of فَرِهَ, meaning Exulting, or rejoicing above measure; &c.]. In the Kur xxvi.
149, some read فَرِهِينَ, from فَرِهَ, signifying as
expl. above: others reading فَارِهِينَ, which is
from فَرُهَ: (S, TA:) ―
-b2-  but فَرِهٌ is also syn. with
فَارِهٌ, as an epithet applied to a youth, or young
man, or male slave; and thus the reading of
فَرِهِينَ in the Kur has been expl. as meaning
Possessing skill. (TA.)
فُرَاهٌ i. q. فُرَاتٌ, as an epithet applied to water,
signifying Sweet, &c.: both are chaste forms,
and well known, like تَابُوهٌ and تَابُوتٌ: so in the
Towsheeh. (MF and TA in art. فرت.)
فَرَاهَةٌ [mentioned in the first paragraph as an
inf. n. is also expl. as a simple subst.]: see فُرُوهَةٌ.
―
-b2-  Also Beauty, or comeliness. (Msb, TA.)
فُرُوهَةٌ [app. an inf. n., but mentioned as a
simple subst., meaning] Skilfulness. (K.) ―
-b2-
And فُرُوهَهٌ and ↓ فَرَاهَةٌ and ↓ فَرَاهِيَةٌ denote a
quality of a hackney and of a mule and of an
ass, (S,) or of a horse, or similar beast, &c.,
(Msb,) all signifying Briskness, liveliness, sprightliness, activity, agility, or lightness. (Msb, TA. *)
فَرَاهِيَةٌ [mentioned in the first paragraph as an
inf. n.]: see what next precedes.
فَارِهٌ Skilful, or possessing skill; (S, Msb, K;)
part. n. of فَرُهَ, irregularly formed, for by rule it
should be فَرِيهٌ: (S:) accord. to Z, it is applied
to a man; and also, without ة, to a قَيْنَة [i. e.
female slave, or slave-songstress]. (Msb.) ―
-b2-
And it is applied as an epithet to a hackney,
(Az, S, Msb,) and a mule, (S,) and an ass, (Az,
S, Msb,) or to a horse, or similar beast, (Az,)
meaning Brisk, lively, sprightly, active, agile, or
light; (Az, * Msb;) sharp; strong; that goes, or
journeys, much; a great goer: (Az, TA:) it is
not applied to a فَرَس, (Az, S,) i. e. to an Arabian
horse; (Az, Msb;) such being termed جَوَادٌ, (Az,
S, Msb,) and رَائِعٌ: (S:) 'Adee Ibn-Zeyd has
applied it to the latter; but As has charged him
with error in so doing; saying that he possessed
not knowledge of horses: (S:) the pl. is فُرْهٌ, (S,
Msb,) like بُزْلٌ and حُولٌ pls. of بَازِلٌ and حَائِلٌ,
(S,) or فُرُهٌ, like كُتُبٌ, (K,) and فَرَهَةٌ, with two
fet-hahs, (Msb,) or فُرْهَةٌ, (S, K,) but this is held
by Sb to be a quasi-pl. n., (ISd, TA,) and فُرَّهٌ,
like رُكَّعٌ, and فُرَّهَةٌ, like سُكَّرَةٌ, (K,) as in the A,
but MF says that no pl. of this measure is known.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  Also, applied to a غُلَام [i. e. youth,
young man, or male slave], Beautiful, or comely,
of countenance. (IAar, TA.) And [the fem.]
فَارِهَةٌ signifies A beautiful, or comely, girl, or
young woman: (K:) [and] so ↓ فَرْهَآءُ, [of which
the masc. is أَفْرَهُ, and] of which the pl. is فُرْهٌ;
but Az says, I do not think that they use this
word in relation to girls, or young women, though
they may apply it peculiarly to female slaves like
as they apply فَارِهٌ and فَارِهَةٌ peculiarly to hackneys
and mules and jades, exclusively of Arabian
horses. (Msb.) ―
-b4-  And فَارِهَةٌ is also syn. with
فَتِيَّةٌ [i. e. A youthful females, or one in the prime
of life]: (thus accord. to several copies of the K
and accord. to the TA:) or قَيْنَةٌ [i. e. a female
slave, or a slave-songstress: see the first sentence
of this paragraph]. (Thus in the CK.) ―
-b5-  And
it signifies also [A woman] who eats vehemently:
(K:) and فَارِهٌ applied to man, A vehement eater.
(IAar, TA.)
أَفْرَهُ: see its fem., فَرْهَآءُ, in the next preceding
paragraph. ―
-b2-  فُلَانٌ أَفْرَهُ مِنْ فُلَانٍ means Such a
one is more beautiful, or comely, than such a one.
(Msb.)
مُفْرِهٌ and مُفْرِهَةٌ (S, K) and مُفَرِّهَةٌ (S) are epithets
applied to a she-camel, meaning Bringing forth
[young ones such as are termed] فُرْهٌ (S) or فُرَّهٌ.
(K.) [See 4.]
