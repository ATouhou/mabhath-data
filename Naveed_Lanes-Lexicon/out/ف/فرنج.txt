فرنجالفِرَنْجُ, n. un. فِرَنْجِىٌّ: see what follows.
الإِفْرَنْجَةُ (O, K) [and الإِفْرَنْجُ, which is the
more common,] and ↓ الفِرَنْجُ, (MF, TA, [but in
the Commentary of MF written without any of
the syll. signs,]) in which last manner it is correctly written accord. to the sheykhs of El-Andalus, who are the nearest to, and the best acquainted
with, the country of the people thus called, and
so written by Suh, (MF,) A certain people; [the
Franks; an appellation given originally, by the
Arabs, to the French; and afterwards to all
Europeans except those of the Turkish Empire:]
an arabicized word from إِفْرَنْك, (K,) or افرنگ,
(O,) or from فرنك [or فِرَنْگ]: (Suh, MF:) accord.
to general analogy, it should be الإِفْرِنْجَةُ, with
kesr to the ر: (O, K:) so called because the seat
of their dominion is [named] فرنجة or فرانسة [i. e.
France]; and their king is called الفرنسپس, [more
properly الفَرَنْسِيْسِىُّ,] which is likewise an arabicized word. (Suh, as cited by MF.) [The n. un.,
or appellation given to a single person of this
people, is إِفْرَنْجِىٌّ and فِرَنْجِىٌّ.]
