فلح1
فَلَحَ, aor.

or cracked; and he cut: (K: [compare فَلَجَ, and
فَلَقَ, and فَلَذَ:]) he clave, and cut, iron. (T, Msb.)
Hence, the saying of a poet, (T, TA,)
إِنَّ الحَدِيدَ بِالحَدِيدِ يُفْلَحُ
Verily iron with iron is cloven, and cut. (T, S,
Mgh, * K. *) And فَلَحَ رَأْسَهُ, inf. n. as above, He
clave, split, or cracked, his head. (TA.) And
فَلَحَ شَفَتَهُ, aor. and inf. n. as above, He slit, or
cracked, his lip. (L.) And فَلَحَ الأَرْضَ, (S,
Msb,) aor. and inf. n. as above, (Msb.) He furrowed, or ploughed, the land, to cultivate it; he
tilled the ground. (S, Msb. [And فَلَجَهَا has a
similar meaning.])
-A2-  Also, aor. and inf. n. as
above, He acted with artifice, fraud, or guile;
(K, TA;) and so ↓ فلّح, inf. n. تَفْلِيحٌ. (K, TA.)
You say, بِهِمْ ↓ فلّح He acted with artifice, fraud,
or guile, towards them, and said what was not true.
(TA.) And بِهِ ↓ فلّح He mocked at him, or

above, inf. n. فَلْحٌ and فَلَاحَةٌ, He defrauded him
in a sale; syn. of the inf. n. بَخْسٌ فِى بَيْعٍ: (so
in the CK:) or he bade high for an article of
merchandise in order to inveigh another into purchasing it at a high price: syn. of the inf. n.
نَجْشٌ فِى بَيْعٍ. (So in other copies of the K, and
in the L and TA.) You say, فَلَحَ بِهِ [He so
acted towards him in a sale]: this is when one
trusts to thee, and says to thee, “Sell to me a
slave,” or “ an article of merchandise,” or “ buy
it for me,” and thou comest to the merchants,
and buyest it at a high price, and sellest by
defrauding, and obtainest something from the
merchant: or, accord. to the T, فَلْحٌ signifies a
hirer's exceeding [in an offer] in order that another
may do so; thus inciting him. (L.)

افلح He prospered; was successful; attained, or acquired, that which he desired or sought,
(MA, L, Msb,) or what was good, or felicity, or
that whereby he became in a happy and good
state: (L:) he was, or became, fortunate, happy,
or in a happy and good state. (MA.) It is commonly known as an intrans. verb; but Talhah
Ibn-Musarrif and 'Amr Ibn-'Obeyd, read قَدْ
أُفْلِحَ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ, [the first verse of ch. xxiii. of the
Kur-án,] with the verb in the pass. form. (MF.)
[See also 10.] ―
-b2-  He was, or became, in a state

prosperous, state, (MA, L,) and in the enjoyment of ease, comfort, or the blessings of life. (L.)

by means of the thing. (K.) The saying of
'Abeed,
أَفْلِحْ بِمَا شِئْتَ فَقَدْ يُبْلَغُ بِا??
(??) وَقَدْ يُخَدَّعُ الأَرِيبُ
means Live thou by what thou wilt: whether by
stupidity or by intelligence; for [one's object is
sometimes attained by stupidity, and the intelligent, or sagacious, is sometimes deluded, or much
deluded; or] the stupid is sometimes supplied with
the means of subsistence, and the intelligent is
[sometimes] denied: (T, L:) or the meaning is
prosper thou, &c. (L.)
10
اِسْتَفْلِحِى بِأَمْرِكِ, said by a man to his wife,
(S,) a form of words used in divorcing (L, K)
in the Time of Ignorance, (L,) Prosper thou in
thy case, (AO, S, Mgh, TA,) and be independent
therein: (AO, Mgh, TA:) when a man says thus
to his wife and she consents, his saying so once
separates her from him so that he cannot take
her back: (L, from a trad.:) but as it is merely
an allusive expression, intention is necessary to
render it binding: as some relate the trad, it is
with ج [i. e. استفلجى: see art. فلج]. (MF.)
[See also 4, above.]
فَلْحٌ A fissure, cleft, slit, or crack: pl. فُلُوحٌ.
(Msb.) One says, فِى رِجْلِهِ فُلُوحٌ In his (a man's,
S) foot are fissures, or cracks, (S, K, TA,) preduced by cold: (TA:) as also فُلُوجٌ. (S, TA.)
فَلَحٌ A fissure, or crack, in the under lip; (T,
K;) [or] ↓ فَلَحَةٌ has this meaning; (S;) or signifies the place of such a fissure or crack: (L:)
[or the former is a coll. gen. n.; and the latter,
its n. un.:] that which is in the upper lip is termed
عَلَمٌ: (T, TA:) or فَلَحٌ signifies a fissure, or
crack, in the lip: or, in the middle of the lip, less
than what is termed عَلَمٌ: or a slitting, or cracking, in the lip, such as happens to the lips of the
[Africans called] زَنْج. (L.) ―
-b2-  [And] The
having the under lip slit, or cracked. (S. [App.
an inf. n. of which the verb is ↓ فَلِحَ: like as it
is of فَلِحَت said of the under lip as mentioned
above.])
-A2-  See also فَلَاحٌ.

-b2-  Also A [field, or land, such
as is termed] قَرَاح, (AHn, L, K,) furrowed, or
ploughed, for cultivation: its pl., فَلَحَات, occurs

as others relate it, it is فَلَجَات, with ج.
(AHn, L.)
فَلَاحٌ (S, A, Mgh, L, Msb, K, &c.) and ↓ فَلَحٌ
(S, L, K) the latter a contraction of the former,

A, Mgh, L, Msb, K,) or of that whereby one becomes in a happy and good state. (L.) And
Safety, or security. (S, L, K.) And Continuance, or permanence, in a good, or prosperous,
state, (A, L, K,) and in the enjoyment of ease,
comfort, or the blessings of life; and the continuance of good: (L:) and simply continuance,
permanence, lastingness, duration, or endurance.
(ISK, S, L.) There is not in the language of the
Arabs any word more comprehensive in its significations of what is good in the present life
and in the final state than الفَلَاحُ. (TA.) حَىَّ
عَلَى الفَلَاحْ, in the call to prayer, means Come
ye to the means of the attainment of Paradise,
and of permanence therein: (IAth, L:) or hasten
to the attainment of everlasting life: (L:) or
come to safety, or security: (S:) or come ye to
the way of safety and prosperity: (Msb:) or
come to the continuance of good. (L.) And you
say, لَا أَفْعَلُ ذٰلِكَ فَلَاحَ الدَّهْرِ I will not do that
while time lasts. (L.) A poet says,
وَلٰكِنْ لَيْسَ لِلدُّنْيَا فَلَاحُ
meaning [But there is not to the present state of
existence] lastingness, or endurance. (S, L.) ―
-b2-

فَلَاحَةٌ: see what next follows.
فِلَاحَةٌ, (thus in my copies of the S, and in the
L and Msb,) with kesr, (Msb,) [agreeably with
general analogy,] or ↓ فَلَاحَةٌ, with fet-h, (K, [but
I think that fet-h is here a mistake for kesr,
because فَلَاحَهٌ deviates from general analogy, and
because it is a general rule of the author of the
K to omit the mention of the vowel of a word
when it is fet-h,]) Agriculture; or the art, work,
or occupation, of ploughing, tilling, or cultivating,
land. (S, L, Msb, K.)

أَفْلَحُ Having a fissure, or crack, in the under
lip: (S, Mgh:) or a man having what is termed
فَلَحٌ in his lip: fem. فَلْحَآءُ. (L.) 'Antarah El-
'Absee was surnamed الفَلْحَآءُ because of a fissure
in his under lip; the fem. form of the epithet
being used because الشَّفَةُ (the lip) is fem.; (S,
L;) or because his name is fem. (L.) [See also
أَعْلَمُ.]
قَوْمٌ أَفْلَاحٌ [i. q. مُفْلِحُونَ] A people prospering;
successful; attaining, or acquiring, that which
