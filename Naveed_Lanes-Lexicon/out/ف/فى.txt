فىفِى is a particle governing the gen. case [and
used in the manners and senses expl in what here
follows]. (T, S, M, Mughnee, K.) ―
-b2-  It relates
to a receptacle; (Sb, S, M;) and, when used in
a wider sense, to that which has some near resemblance thereto; (Sb, M;) [i. e.,] and also to
what is considered as a receptacle: (S:) [in other
words,] it denotes inclusion, or inbeing, (Msb,
Mughnee, K, TA,) either in relation to place or
in relation to time: (Mughnee, K, TA;) properly
and tropically. (Msb, Mughnee, TA.) غُلِبَتِ
الرُّومُ فِى أَدْنَى الْأَرْضِ وَهُمْ مِنْ بَعْدِ غَلَبِهِمْ سَيَغْلِبُونَ
فِى بِضْعِ سِنِينَ [The Greeks have been overcome in
the nearer, or nearest, part of the land, and they,
after the overcoming of them, shall overcome in
some few years], in the Kur [xxx. 1 — 3], is an
ex. of its relation to place and to time. (Mughnee.) And وَلَكُمْ فِى الْقِصَاصِ حَيٰوةٌ (tropical:)  [And there
is, to you, in retaliation, life, or an advantage,
(respecting the meaning of which see art. حى,)
in the Kur ii. 175,] is an ex. of its being used
tropically, (Mughnee.) أَدْخَلْتُ الخَاتَمَ فِى أُصْبَعِى
is an ex. of its relation to place, but the proposition is inverted [i. e. the meaning is I inserted
my finger into the signet-ring]. (Mughnee.)
[Using it properly,] you say, المَآءُ فِى الإِنَآءِ [The
water is in the vessel]: (S:) and هُوَ فِى الجِرَابِ
[It is in the wallet,] and فِى الكِيسِ [in the purse]:
and هُوَ فِى بَطْنِ أُمِّهِ [He is in the belly of his
mother]: and هُوَ فِى الغُلِّ [He is in the shackle
for the neck]: (M:) and زَيْدٌ فِى الدَّارِ [Zeyd is
in the house], (S, M, * Msb,) or within the house,
and in the midst of it, for فِى الدَّارِ, means دَاخِلِهَا,
and وَسْطَهَا: (T:) and [using it tropically, you
say,] الشَّكُّ فِى الخَبَرِ (assumed tropical:)  [Doubt, or uncertainty, is
in the information]. (S.) The saying فِيهِ عَيْبٌ
[In him is a fault, or blemish], if relating to a
real عَيْب, is proper; and if relating to an ideal
عَيْب, tropical: the former is such as the amputation of the hand of the thief, and the redundance
of a hand; and the latter, such as the runningaway of a slave. (Msb.) [When relating to
time, it may in some cases be rendered In, or
during; as in the phrase فِى أَيَّامٍ مَعْدُودَاتٍ, in
the Kur ii. 139, i. e. In, or during, certain numbered days. إِنَّ أَصْحَابَ الْجَنَّةِ الْيَوْمَ فِى شُغُلٍ
فَاكِهُونَ, in the Kur xxxvi. 55, may be rendered
(assumed tropical:)  Verily the inmates of Paradise this day shall be
in the midst of diverting occupation, cheerful, or
happy. The phrase أَمَّا قَوْلُهُ كَذَا فِيهِ مَا فِيهِ, lit.
(assumed tropical:)  As to his saying thus, in it is what is in it, is
used as a polite expression of objection, or contradiction; like فِيهِ تَأَمُّلٌ, q. v. In many instances, فِى may be rendered Of, or concerning,
or in respect of; as in قَالَ فِيهِ كَذَا (assumed tropical:)  He said of,
or concerning, him, or it, thus; for قَالَ فِى ذِكْرِهِ
كَذَا (assumed tropical:)  He said in mentioning him, or it, thus,
or فِى وَصْفِهِ in describing him, or it; or the like
hence, for ex., one says كَتَبَ كِتَابًا فِى عِلْمِ اللُّغَةِ
(assumed tropical:)  He wrote a book of, or concerning the science of
lexicology: and hence, in the Kur ii. 133, أَتُّحَاجُّونَنَا
فِى اللّٰهِ  (assumed tropical:)  Do ye argue with us concerning, or in
respect of, God?] ―
-b3-  It also denotes concomitance, (Mughnee, K,) and (K) in this ease
(Mughnee) it is syn. with مَعَ. (Msb, Mughnee,
K.) Thus in the phrase, قَالَ ادْخُلُوا فِى أُمَمٍ [He
shall say, Enter ye with peoples]. (Msb, Mughnee,
TA,) in the Kur [vii. 36]: (Msb, TA:) or, as
some say, the meaning is, فِى جَمَاعَةِ أُمَمٍ [in the
company of peoples]. (Mughnee.) Thus. too, in
the phrase, in the Kur [xlvi. 15], فِى أَصْحَابِ
الجَنَّةِ [With the inmates of Paradise]. (Msb,
TA.) [Or in these and similar instances, فِى
may be rendered, more agreeably with the primary
signification, as meaning Among.] In the K, the
meaning as denoting concomitance and that which
is identical with مَعَ are made distinct: and it has
been said that بِ denotes the continuance of concomitance and مَعَ denotes its commencement;
though this is not invariably the case. (MF,
TA.) [Hence it is used to denote a combination
of two qualities: as in the phrase طُولٌ فِى اسْتِرْخَآءٍ
(assumed tropical:)  Length together with laxness: (occurring in the
K voce طَنَبٌ:) and سَوَادٌ فِى حُمْرَةٍ (assumed tropical:)  Blackness
blending with redness: and the like. And in like
manner it is used to denote the combination of
the length and breadth of a thing: as in the phrase
طُولُهُ عِشْرُونَ ذِرَاعًا فِى ثَلَاثِ أَذْرُعٍ عَرْضًا Its length is
twenty cubits with (or as we say by) three cubits
in breadth: in which case the number of square
cubits is expressed by the phrase عِشْرُونَ فِى ثَلَاثٍ
as though meaning Twenty as a multiplicand with
three as its multiplier; i. e. twenty multiplied by
three: see ضَرَبَ as signifying “ he multiplied. ”].
―
-b4-  It also denotes the assigning of a cause. (Msb,
Mughnee, K.) Thus in the phrase فِى أَرْبَعِينَ شَاةٌ
i. e. On account, or because, of completing [the
possession of] forty sheep or goats, [the giving of]
a sheep or goat [for the poor-rate] is incumbent
[on the possessor: or this may be rendered, in
the case of the possession of forty, a sheep or
goat is to be given]. (Msb.) And thus in the
saying, [in the Kur xii. 32,] فَذٰلِكُنَّ الَّذِى لُمْتُنَّنِى
فِيهِ [And that is he because of whom ye blamed
me]. (Mughnee.) Thus also in the saying, in a
trad., إِنَّ امْرَأَةً دَخَلَتِ النَّارَ فِى هِرَّةٍ حَبَسَتْهَا [Verily
a woman entered the fire of Hell because of a she-cat which she confined without food]. (Mughnee.)
[And thus in the phrase أَسْلَفَ فِى كَذَا He paid
in advance, or beforehand, for, or on account of,
such a thing.] ―
-b5-  It also denotes superiority;
(Mughnee, K, TA;) i. e. (TA) it is used in the
sense of عَلَى. (T, S, M, Msb, TA.) Thus in
the saying, in the Kur [xx. 74], وَلَأُصَلِّبَنَّكُمْ فِى
جُذُوعِ النَّخْلِ [And I will assuredly crucify you
upon the trunks of palm-trees]. (T, S, Msb,
Mughnee, TA.) And so in the verse of 'Antarah
cited voce سَرْحٌ. (T, M, Mughnee, TA.) And
Yoo asserts that the Arabs say, نَزَلْتُ فِى أَبِيكَ,
meaning عَلَيْهِ [i. e. I alighted, or descended and
stopped, &c., at the abode of thy father]. (S.)
―
-b6-  It is also syn. with بِ, (T, S, M, Mughnee,
K,) sometimes. (S.) Thus in the saying of
Zeyd-el-Kheyl,
وَتَرْكَبُ يَوْمَ الرَّوْعِ فِيهَا فَوَارِسُ
بَصِيرُونَ فِى طَعْنِ الأَبَاهِرِ والكُلَى
(S, Mughnee, TA,) meaning, بِطَعْنِ الاباهر والكلى
[i. e. And horsemen skilful in piercing the aortas
and the kidneys ride in the day of fear therein].
(S, TA.) And thus in a verse cited by Fr, أَرْغَبُ
is made trans. by فِى and عَنْ instead of بِ and
عَنْ. (T, TA.) [Thus, also, لَيْسَ فِى شَىْءٍ is
sometimes used for لَيْسَ بِشَىْءٍ, meaning It is
nought; or not of any account or weight; &c.:
see more in art. شيأ.] ―
-b7-  It is also syn. with إِلَى.
(Mughnee, K.) Thus in the Kur [xiv. 10], فَرَدُّوا
أَيْدِيَهُمْ فِى أَفْوَاههم [And they put their hands to
their mouths]. (Mughnee, TA.) ―
-b8-  It is also syn.
with مِنْ. (M, Mughnee, K, TA.) Thus in the
Kur [xxvii. 12], فِى تِسْعِ آيَاتٍ [Of, or among,
nine signs]. (M, TA.) And in the saying, خُذْ لِى
عَشْرًا مِنَ الإِبِلِ فِيهَا فَحْلَانِ [Take thou for me ten
of the camels; of, or among, them let there be
two stallions. (M, TA.) [Thus too in the saying هُوَ فِى أَصْلِ قَوْمِهِ He is of, or among, the
purest in race, &c., of his people: and the like
thereof.] ―
-b9-  It also denotes comparison; and this
is when it occurs between a preceding [mention of
a] thing excelled and a following [mention of a]
thing excelling: as in the saying, [in the Kur ix.
38,] فَمَا مَتَاعُ الْحَيٰوةِ الدُّنْيَا فِى الْآخِرَةِ إِلَّا قَلِيلٌ [But
the enjoyment of the present life, in comparison
with that which is to come, is no other than little].
(Mughnee, K.) ―
-b10-  It is also used for compensation; and this is when it is redundant as a
compensation for another [فِى] which is suppressed: as in the saying, ضَرَبْتُ فِيمَنْ رَغِبْتَ for
ضَرَبْتُ مَنْ رَغِبْتَ فِيهِ [I beat, or struck, him whom
thou desiredst]: (Mughnee, K:) but this is
allowed by Ibn-Málik alone. (Mughnee.) ―
-b11-
And it is used for corroboration: (Mughnee, K:)
this is when it is redundant without its being for
compensation: and this El-Fárisee allows in a
case of necessity in verse; citing as an ex.,
أَنَا أَبُوا سَعْدٍ إِذَا اللَّيْلُ دَجَا
تَخَالُ فِى سَوَادِهِ يَرَنْدَجَا
[I am Aboo-Saad; when the night becomes dark,
thou imagining its blackness to be black leather].
(Mughnee.) And it is thus used in the saying,
in the Kur [xi. 43], وَقَالَ ارْكَبُوا فِيهَا [for ارْكَبُوهَا,
i. e. And he said, Embark ye therein, the like
of which occurs also in xviii. 70 and xxix. 65],
(Mughnee, K,) accord. to some. (Mughnee.)
-A2-
فِى as a prefixed noun in the gen. case, syn. with
فَم, and فِىَّ as syn. with فَمِى, see voce فُوهٌ, in
art. فوه.
فَىَّ is a word expressive of wonder: they say,
يَا فَىَّ مَا لِى أَفْعَلُ كَذَا [O my wonder! What has
happened to me that I do thus?]: or it is expressive of regret on account of a thing that is passing
away [so that this exclamation may be rendered
Oh! What has happened to me &c.]: Ks says
that it is not to be written withء [though it is so
written in several of the lexicons in art. فيأ, i. e.
فَىْءَ]; and that it means يَا عَجَبِى [as first expl.
above]: and in like manner one says, يَا فَىَّ مَا
أَصْحَابُكَ [O my wonder! What are thy companions? i. e. what manner of men are thy companions? ما here denoting interrogation respecting qualities, or attributes; as in the Kur xxvi.
22]: and he says that ما in this case occupies the
place of a noun in the nom. case. (M, TA.) Ks
is also related to have said that some of the Arabs
express wonder by فَىَّ and هَىَّ and شَىْءَ; and
some add مَا, saying يَا فَيَّمَا and يَا هَيَّمَا and يَا
شَيْئَمَا, meaning How good, or beautiful, is this!
the K is faulty here; mentioning only يَا فَيَّمَا, and
explaining it as denoting wonder. (TA.)
تَفِيَّةٌ: see تَفِيْئَةٌ, in art. فيأ.
