TA,) i. q. فَرْقَعَهَا, (S, O, * K, * TA, *) [He cracked
the joints of his fingers;] i. e. he pressed his fingers
so that a sound was heard to proceed from their
joints: (TA:) the action signified thereby is forbidden to be performed in prayer: (O, TA:) [but
it is said that] this is the contracting of the fingers
to the inner side of the hand and making a sound
with the outer side [app. by pressing the fist upon
the ground so as to make the joints of the fingers
crack, when rising; for I think that any action
more irregular than this would be too obviously
wrong to need prohibition]. (O.) ―

5
تَفَقَّعَ see 1. ―
-b2-  [Reiske, as stated by Freytag,
has explained this verb as signifying It was, or
became, contracted; said of a hand: but probably, I think, in consequence of his having
found تَفَقَّعَت erroneously written for تَقَفَّعَت.]
6
تفاقعت عَيْنَاهُ His eyes became white: (O,
K, TA:) or became cleft, or fissured: or had in

ISk, (S, O,) A species of كَمْأَة [or truffles]; (S,
O;) accord. to A 'Obeyd, (S, O,) the white and
soft thereof: (S, O, K;) which is the worst
thereof; or, as IAth says, a species of the worst
[kind] of كمأة, accord. to AHn, it comes forth
from the ground so as to appear, white, and is
bad; the good being that which is extracted by
digging: Lth says, It is a كَمْء [or truffle] that
comes forth from the base of the plant called إِجْرِد
[q. v.], and is of the worst of كمأة, and the
quickest in becoming corrupt: (TA:) the pl. is
فِقَعَةٌ, (S, O, K,) which is of both forms of the
sing.; (S, O, TA;) and فَقْعٌ, with fet-h, has for
pls. أُفْقُعٌ [a pl. of pauc.] and فُقُوعٌ [a pl. of mult.].
(AHn, TA.) A vile man is likened thereto: (S,
O, K: *) one says, هُوَ أَذَلُّ مِنْ فَقْعِ قَرْقَرٍ, (S,) or
مِنْ فَقْعٍ بقَرْقَرَةٍ, (O, K,) [He is more vile than the
فقع of, or than فقع In, a (??) and soft tract of
ground,] because the beasts kick it along, (S,) or
because it offers not resistance to the gatherer
thereof, or because it is trodden with the feet, (O,
K,) and the beasts kick it along. (O.) ―
-b2-  [From
a mention of the pl. فَقُوعٌ in art. ذأن, and in the
present art. in the TA, it appears that فَقْعٌ is also
applied to The species of fungus called ذُؤْنُون, and
to the species called طُرْثُوث, &c.] ―
-b3-  And [hence,
perhaps,] فَقْعٌ [as a coll. a.] signifies also (assumed tropical:)  Pointed
toes (خَرَاطِيم of a sort of boots (O, TA.)
فِقْعٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
فَقَاعٍ; see what next follows.
فُقَاعٍ; (O, and thus in my MS, copy of the K;
in other copies of the K فُقَاع or فُقَاعٌ; and in all
the copies is added بالضَّمِّ كَرُبَاع or كَرُبَاعٍ; [but
there is no such word as رُبَاعٍ. nor رُباعٌ; whence
it seems to be meant that we should read كَرُبَاعَ;
i. e. فُقَاعُ, like رُباعُ, imperfectly decl.; but see
what follows;]) so says Ibn-Buzurj: (O:) or,
(O, K,) accord. to AZ, (O,) ↓ فقاعٍ, (O, K, *) like
رُبَاعٍ, (O.) [i. e.] with fet-h, like ثَمَانٍ (كَثَمَانٍ):
(K:) [which suggests that كَرُبَاعٍ may be an
early mistranscription for كَربَاعٍ, and that فُقَاع is
wrong, and only فَقَاعٍ right, though it is said in
one place in the TA that فَقَاع is like سَحَاب, i. e.
that it is فَقَاعٌ:] or it is ↓ فَقِيعٌ, like أَمِيرٌ; (K,
TA;) so accord. to El-Jáhidh, as mentioned by
Az: (TA:) applied to a man, as meaning Red;
(O, K, TA;) intensely so; by reason of إِغْرَاب
[i. e. app., goodliness of condition]: (O, TA:) and
↓ فُقَاعِيٌّ, as an epithet applied to a man, signifies
red. (TA.)
فَقِيعٌ, (so in the O,) or ↓ فِقِّيعٌ, like سِكِّيتٌ, (K,)
but the former, like أَمِيرٌ, is the right, [a coll. gen.
n.,] and its n. un. is with ة, (TA,) The white, of
pigeons; (K, TA;) said by El-Jáhidh to be such,
of pigeons, as are like the صِقْلَابِىّ [or Sclave] of
men; (O, TA;) a kind of white pigeon; so called
as being likened to a [white] species of truffle
[i. e. the فَقْع]. (TA.) ―

O,) or ↓ ابيض فِقِّيعٌ, like سِكِّيتٌ, (K,) White that

فَاقِعٌ.] ―

see فُقَاعٍ.

or vehement; and bad, corrupt, or wicked. (Lth,
O, K.)
فُقَّاعٌ. 1 certain beverage, (S, O, L, K,) [a sort

are several sorts thereof, perhaps peculiar to postclassical times: (see De Sacy's Chrest. Arabe,
see, ed., vol. i., pp. 149-154:)] so called because
of the froth that rises upon its head. (O, K. [See
فُقَّاعَةٌ.]) ―
-b2-  And A certain plant, (AHn, O, K.)
such as is termed ↓ مُتَفَقِّعٌ, i. e., (AHn, O, K. *)
which, when it dries up, becomes hard, and as
though it were horns. (AHn, O, K.) [Now applied in North-Western Africa to The toadstool,
which is called in other parts فُطْرٌ.]
فِقِّيعٌ: see فَقِيعٌ, in two places.
فُقَّاعَةٌ, like رُمَّانَةٌ, sing. of فَقَاقِيعُ, (TA,) which
signifies The bubbles that rise upon water, (S, O,
K, TA,) and upon wine, (O,) [&c.,] round, [or
globular.] (TA,) like قَوَارِير [or vessels of glass].
(S, O, TA.)
فُقَّاعِىٌّ A seller of [the beverage called] فُقَّاع.
(TA.)
فَاقِعٌ (S, O, K) and ↓ فُقَاعِىٌّ (K) Yellow intensely yellow; (S, O, K;) thus both signify:
(Lh, K, TA:) or red intensely red: (K:) or red
free from an admixture of whiteness: or purely
red: (TA:) or فَاقِعٌ is applied to white and to
any other colour as signifying free from admixture; (K;) and ↓ فُقَاعِىٌّ is applied in this sense
to white: (TA:) and ↓ أَفْقَعُ, of which the pl. is
فُقْعٌ, signifies intensely white. (K.)

فَقْرٌ مُفْقِعٌ, accord. to the K, signifies مُدْقِعٌ [as
though meaning Poverty causing to cleave to the
dust or earth]: but the right phrase is فَقِيرٌ مُفْقِعٌ,
signifying مُدْقِعٌ [i. e. a poor person cleaving to
the dust or earth: for أَدْقَعَ is intrans. as well as
trans.]; which denotes the worst condition, like
مَجْهُودٌ. (TA.) [See 4.]

with a sound]: see 1, last sentence but one.
