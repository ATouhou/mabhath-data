(S,) excessive, immoderate, enormous, exorbitant,
beyond measure, exceeding the proper bounds or
limits, (S, O, Msb, TA,) or overmuch: (O, K,
TA:) anything not agreeable with truth, and with
rule or measure: (TA:) foul, evil, bad, abominable, or unseemly; [gross, immodest, lewd, or
obscene;] applied to a thing or an affair, (Mgh,
Msb,) and to speech or language. (TA.) It is
said in a trad., He was asked respecting the
blood of fleas, [whether it rendered a garment
impure,] and said إِنْ لَمْ يَكُنْ فَاحِشًا فَلَا بَأْسَ بِهِ If
it is not excessive, or beyond measure, there is no
harm in it. (TA.) ―

reply: (K, * TA:) who is foul, evil, bad, abominable, or unseemly; [gross, immodest, lewd, or
obscene;] in speech or language, (Mgh, TA,) and
in action: (TA:) and ↓ فَحَّاشٌ signifies the same;
(S, * A, * Mgh;) or has an intensive signification:
(TA:) pl. of the former فُحَشَآءُ, like as جُهَلَآءُ is
pl. of جَاهِلٌ, since فُحْش is a sort of جَهْل, and
contr. of حِلْم. (IJ.) It is said in a trad., لَا
تَكُونِى فَاحِشَةً, meaning Be not thou a trangressor
of the proper bounds or limits in reply: which
words were addressed to 'Áïsheh: (K, TA:) but
accord. to one relation, the words were لَا تَقُولِى
فَاحِشَةً. (TA.) [See فَاحِشَةٌ, below.] ―

evil in disposition. (IB.) ―

exceeding the bounds of rectitude:] a thing excessively, enormously, or beyond measure, foul, evil,
bad, abominable, or unseemly; [gross, immodest,
lewd, or obscene:] (Mgh:) or anything not agreeable with truth: (Lth, Mgh:) or a sin, or crime,
that is very foul, evil, bad, &c.: or anything forbidden by God: (K:) or any saying, or action,
that is foul, evil, bad, &c.: (TA:) and ↓ فَحْشَآءُ
signifies the same as فَاحِشَةٌ; (S;) or an enormity,
or excessive sin, beyond measure foul, evil, bad, &c.;
or a thing that reason disapproves, and the law
regards as foul, evil, bad, &c.: (Bd in ii. 164:)
the pl. of فَاحِشَةٌ is فَوَاحِشُ. (Msb, TA.) Also,
particularly, Adultery, or fornication; (S, Mgh,
Msb, K;) and so ↓ فَحْشَآءُ: (Bd in xii. 24; &c.:)
so in the Kur iv. 23 and lxv. 1 [as well as in
numerous other instances]: or the فاحشة [or
excess] there mentioned is the women's going
out without permission: (Mgh, Msb:) or their
using foul language against their husband's relations, by reason of the sharpness of their tongues.
(Esh-Sháfi'ee.) And ↓ فَحْشَآءُ particularly signifies Niggardliness, tenaciousness, or avarice, (A,
K,) in the payment of the poor-rate: or the
abstaining [altogether] from paying it. (TA.)
