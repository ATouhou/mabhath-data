(M, Msb, K,) He separated, or divided, (S, O,
Msb, K,) and put apart, (Msb,) a thing, (S, O,
Msb, *) عَنْ غَيْرِهِ [from another thing], (Msb,)
and بَعْضَهُ مِنْ بَعْضٍ [or عَنْ بَعْضٍ i. e. part thereof
from part]. (M and TA in art. ميز.) And (K,)
He made a separation, or partition, (M, K, TA,)
بَيْنَهُمَا (M, TA *) i. e. between them two, meaning,

فَصَلَ الحَدُّ بَيْنَ الأَرْضَيْنِ, [aor. and] inf. n. as
above, The limit, or boundary, made, or formed,
a separation between the two lands: (Msb:) and
فَصَلْتُ بَيْنَ القَوْمِ I made a division, or separation,
between, or among, the people, or party. (O.) ―
-b2-
[Hence,] فَصَلَ الرّضِيعَ عَنْ أُمِّهِ, (S, Mgh, O,) or
المَوْلُودَ (M, K) عَنِ الرَّضَاعِ, (M,) aor. as above,
(M, K,) inf. n. فِصَالٌ, (S, O,) or فَصْلٌ, and the
former is a simple subst., (M, K,) or both, (Mgh,)
He weaned [the suckling from his mother, or the

Mgh, O, K;) as also ↓ افتصلهُ: (S, M, O:) or

or this latter means distinct, or plain speech; which
he to whom it is addressed distinctly, or plainly, understands; which is not confused, or dubious, to him:
(Ksh in explanation of it in the Kur xxxviii. 19,
and Mgh:) or such as decides, or distinguishes,
between what is true and what is false, (Ksh ibid.,
Mgh, O, K,) and what is sound and what is corrupt, (Ksh, Mgh,) and what is correct and what
is erroneous: (Ksh:) or such as decides the judgment, or judicial sentence: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or
the evidence, or proof, that is obligatory [as a condition of his justification] upon the claimant, or
plaintiff, and the oath that is obligatory [in like
manner] upon him against whom the claim, or
plaint, is urged; (Ksh, O, K; [an explanation
of which a part is dropped in the CK;]) thus
accord. to 'Alee: (Ksh:) or the [using of the]
phrase أَمَّا بَعْدُ. (Ksh, O, K. [Respecting this
phrase, and for other explanations, see 3 in art
خطب.]) كَلِمَةُ الفَصْلِ in the Kur xlii. 20 means
The sentence of God's deciding between mankind
on the day of resurrection, (O,) which is called
يَوْمُ الفَصْلِ. (TA.) And الفَصْلُ [alone] means The
deciding judicially between what is true and what
is false; (M, O, K;) and, (O, K,) sometimes,
(O,) so ↓ الفَيْصَلُ; (S, O, K;) or this latter is [a
simple subst, i. e.,] a name for such decision;
(TA;) and is also an epithet [expl. below]. (M,
O, K.) هٰذَا يَوْمُ الدِّينِ هٰذَا يَوْمُ الْفَصْلِ, in the Kur
xxxvii. 20 and 21, means [This is the day of requital:] this is the day wherein a decision, or a
distinction, shall be made (يُفْصَلُ فِيهِ) between the
doer of good and the doer of evil, and every one
shall be requited for his work and with that wherewith God will favour his servant the Muslim. (M.)
And إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ يَفْصِلُ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ فِيمَا كَانُوا
فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ, in the Kur xxxii. 25, means [Verily
thy Lord] He shall decide [between them], and
distinguish what is true from what is false, [on the
day of resurrection,] by distinguishing the speaker
of what is true from the speaker of what is false,
in respect of that wherein they used to disagree,
of what concerned religion. (Bd.) And one says
also فَصَلَ الحُكْمَ [He decided the judgment, or
judicial sentence]. (M.) فَصَلَ النَّظْمَ, in the K, is a
mistake: see 2. (TA.)
-A2-  فَصَلَ مِنَ النَّاحِيَةِ, (S, O,)
or مِنْ البَلَدِ (K,) or عَنْ بَلَدِكَذَا, aor.
فَصُلَ, (M,) inf.
n. فُصُولٌ, (M, K,) He went forth [from the part of
the country, or from the town or country, or from
such a town or country]. (S, O, K.) And فَصَلَ
العَسْكَرُ عَنِ البَلَدِ [The army went forth from the
town or country]: whence the saying of the Prophet respecting Ibn-Rawáhah, كَانَ أَوَّلَنَا فُصُولًا
وَآخِرُنَاقُفُولًا i. e. He was the first of us in going
away (↓ اِنْفِصَالًا) from his house and his family
and the last of us in returning to [it and] them.
(Mgh.) And فَصَلَ فُلَانٌ مِنْ عِنْدِى, inf. n. فُصُولٌ,
Such a one went forth [from my presence or
vicinage, or from me]. (TA.) And فَصَلَ مِنِّى
كِتَابُ إِلَيْهِ [A letter] passed from me to him.

its inf. n. when it is trans, being فَصْلٌ; when

-b5-  whence
تَفْصِيلٌ means The cut of a garment (See also
De Sacy's Chrest. Ar., see. ed., i. 86-7.)] ―
-b6-  And
[hence, likewise,] تَفْصِيلٌ also signifies [The dissecting, or analyzing, of speech, or language: the
explaining distinctly, or in detail: and] the making
distinct, clear, plain, manifest, or perspicuous;
i. q. تَبْيِينٌ. (S, O, K.) فَصَّلْنَاهُ in the Kur vii.
50 [referring to the book of the Kur an] means
بيّنَّاهُ [Which we have made distinct, &c.]: or, as
some say, whereof we have divided the verses by
means of the فَوَاصِل [pl. of فَاصِلةٌ, q. v.]. (TA.)

―
-b4-  As used by the Basrees, [in grammar,] it is

[viii. 32], إنْ كَانَ هٰذَا هُوَ الْحَقَّ مِنْ عِنْدِكَ [lit.
If this, it, be the truth from Thee], هو is termed
فصل and عماد, [more commonly the former,] and
الحقّ is in the accus. case as being the predicate
of كان. (O.) ―
-b5-  Also sing. of فُصُول in the

opposed to أصْلٌ under the latter of these words ;)
-A2-  [It is also used as an epithet;] One say (??)
فَصْلٌ A true say or saying: (M, K;) not false:
thus in the Kur [lxxxvi. 15]: (M.) or (??)

times such a young one of the bovine kind: (TA:)

a general sense], because he is, or will be, weaned
from his mother: (Msb:) [in the T, voce حُوَارٌ,
and in other lexicons &c., it is applied to a young,
newly-born, camel: and in the L, voce سُخْدٌ, to
a fœtus in a she-camel's belly: see an ex. of its
meaning a young sucking camel (one of many
such exs.) in the first paragraph of art. رجل;
and a strange similar usage of the first of the following pls. in a verse cited voce خَسْفٌ:] the pl.
is فُصْلَانٌ, (Sb, S, M, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) agreeably with rule, (Sb, M,) and فِصْلَانٌ, (Sb, Fr,

than the قَبِيلَة: (TA:) [see شَعْبٌ in two places:]
or the nearest to him of the آبَآء [meaning male
ancestors and including paternal uncles] of a man:
(Th, M, K, TA:) [or any one of such persons;
for] El-'Abbás [one of Mohammad's paternal
uncles] was called فَصِيلَةُ النَّبِيِّ: the term is like

meaning [Whoso expends expense] such as distinguishes between his belief and his unbelief [i. e.
such as distinguishes him as a believer, it shall be
rewarded with seven hundred fold]: (S, O, K,

his property. (TA.) And one says كَلَامٌ فَاصِلٌ

(TA,) between two persons. (O, TA.) ―

it is also an epithet: see فَاصِلٌ, in four places. ―
-b3-
And [hence] it signifies (assumed tropical:)  A judge, one who decides
judicially, an arbiter, or arbitrator; (S, O, K;)
and so ↓ فَيْصَلِىٌّ: (Ibn-'Abbád, O, K:) in the
Expos. of the “ Miftáh ” [of Es-Sekkákee] by the
seyyid [El-Jurjánee] it is implied that it is in this
sense a tropical intensive appellation. (TA.)

members: (S, O, Msb, K:) [a joint such as the
elbow and knee and knuckle: and sometimes a
joint as meaning a bone having an articulation
at each end, or at one end, together with the flesh
that is upon it:] in a trad. in which it is said that
the mulct for any مَفْصِل of a human being is the
third of the mulct for the [whole] finger, it means
the مَفْصِل of any of the fingers or toes; i. e. the
portion between any أَنْمَلَتَانِ [here meaning two
knuckles; but this is a loose and an imperfect
explanation; for to it should be added, and also
the ungual portion, or portion in which is the nail;
for the word is here applied to denote any of the
phalanges with the flesh that is upon it: in the T
&c., in art. نمل, one of the explanations of الأَنْمَلَةُ
is “ the مَفْصِل in which is the nail ”]. (TA.) ―
-b2-
And [hence] one says, يَأْتِيكَ بِالأَمْرِ مِنْ مَفْصِلِهِ
(assumed tropical:)  [He will tell thee the thing, or affair, tracing it
from the point on which it turns, or hinges; (like
as one says, مِنْ فَصِّهِ, q. v.;) or], from its utmost

saying may be originally a hemistich, thus:
وَيَأْتِيكَ بِالأَمْرِ مِنْ مَفْصِلِهْ
like the similar saying ending with فَصِّهِ.] ―
-b3-  In
the following saying of Aboo-Dhu-eyb, [the
former half of which I give from art. طفل in the
S, the latter half only being cited in the present
art. in the S and M and O,]
وَإِنَّ حَدِيثًا مِنْكِ لَوْ تَبْذُلِينَهُ

تُشَابُ بِمَآءٍ مِثْلِ مَآءِ المَفَاصِلِ
[And verily discourse from thee, if thou wouldst
bestow it, would be (like) gathered honey of bees
in the milk (lit. milks) of camels such as have
recently brought forth, having young ones with
them, such as have young ones with them [and]

forth has been recent, such milk being mixed with

As, S, O) the place of separation (↓ مُنْفَصَل) of
the mountain from the tract of sand, these two

glistens, (وَيَبْرُقُ, S, O,) or and is shallow; (وَيَرِقُّ;)
the poet meaning to describe the clearness of the
water because of its descending from the mountain and not passing by dust nor earth: (M:) or
it signifies hard stones (M, K) compactly disposed,
or heaped up: (M, K: in the former, مُتَرَاصِفَة:
in the latter, مُتَرَاكِمَة:) and (M, K) it is said to
signify (M) what is between two mountains, (M,
K,) consisting of sand and crushed pebbles, the
water whereof is clear: (K:) or, accord. to AO,
the water-courses of a valley: (O:) accord. to
Abu-l-'Omeythil, the clefts in mountains, from
which water flows; and only said of what are
between two mountains: in the T, the مَفْصِل is
said to be any place, in a mountain, upon which
the sun does not rise: (TA:) and it is said that
مَآءُ المَفَاصِلِ means what flows from between the
two joints (مِنْ بَيْنِ المَفْصِلَيْنِ) when one of them
is cut from the other; like clear water; and the
sing. is مَفْصِلٌ: (M:) AA says that the مفاصل in
the verse are the مفاصل of the bones; and that it
likens that water to the مآء of the flesh: (O, TA:)
and IAar says the like thereof. (TA.)

-b3-  And المُفَصَّلُ is an
appellation of The portion of the Kur-án from
[the chapter entitled] الحُجُرَات [i. e. ch. xlix.] to
the end; accord. to the most correct opinion: or
from الجَاثِيَة [ch. xlv.]: or from القِتَال [ch. xlvii.]:
or from قَاف [ch. l.]: or from الصَّافَّات [ch.
xxxvii.]: or from الصَّفّ [ch. lxi.]: or from تَبَارَكَ
[ch. lxvii.]: or from إِنَّا فَتَحْنَا [ch. xlviii.]: or
from سَبِّحِ اسْمَ رَبِّكَ [ch. lxxxvii.]: or from
الضُّحَى [ch. xciii.]: (K:) this portion is thus
called because of its many divisions between its
chapters: (Msb, K:) or because of the few
abrogations therein: (K:) accord. to the A, it
is the portion next after that called المَثَانِى.
(TA.)
مُنْفَصَلٌ: see مَفْصِلٌ, latter half.
