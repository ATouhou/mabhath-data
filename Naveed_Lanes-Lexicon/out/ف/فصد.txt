-b3-  لَمْ يُحْرَمْ مَنْ فُصْدَ لَهُ He has
not been denied the entertainment of a guest for
whom a camel has been bled by the slitting [or
opening] of a vein and who has had the blood so
obtained, (M, A, * K,) is a prov.; (S, M, A, O;)
فُصْدَ being for فُصِدَ, (S, M, O, K,) like ضُرْبَ for
ضُرِبَ, and قُتْلَ for قُتِلَ; (M;) and some, also,
say فُزْدَ; (S, M, O, K;) for every quiescent ص
before د may be changed into ز; and every
movent ص before د may have somewhat of the
sound of ز given to it, (S, M, O,) but may not in
this case be altogether changed into ز; so that for
صَدَرَ and صَدَفَ you may not say زَدَرَ and زَدَفَ:
(M:) some, also, say مَنْ قُصِدَ لَهُ, with ق, meaning مَنْ أُعْطِىَ قَصْدًا i. e. [who has been given] a
little: (S, O, K:) the origin of the saying was
this: two men passed the night at the abode of
an Arab of the desert, and, meeting in the morning, one of them asked his companion respecting
the entertainment given by the host, and the
latter answered, “I was not entertained as a
guest, but only a vein [of a camel] was slit [or
opened] to draw blood for me; ” whereupon the
other replied in the words above: (O, K:) or a
man used to entertain another as his guest in a
time of scarcity, and, having no food to offer him,
and being unwilling to slaughter his camel, bled
it by slitting [or opening] a vein, and heated the
blood that came forth, for his guest, until it
became thick, and gave it to him to eat; and
hence this prov.: (M, L:) it is applied to him
who has obtained a part of that which he wanted.
