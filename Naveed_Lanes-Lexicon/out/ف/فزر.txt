فِزْرٌ A flock of sheep, or herd of goats: (S, O:)
or a flock of sheep from ten to forty: (AZ,
A'Obeyd, S, O, K:) or from three to ten; thus
in the copies of the K; but in the L, to twenty:
(TA:) and two, and more: (S, O, K:) and hence,
(S, O,) الفِزْرُ was a surname of Saad Ibn-ZeydMenáh: he came to the مَوْسِم [or fair, and place
of meeting, app. of the pilgrims,] with some goats,
and allowed them to be taken as spoil, saying,
“ Whoso takes of them one, it shall be his, but a
فِزْر [i. e. a pair or more] of them shall not be
taken; ” فِزْرٌ here meaning two and more: whence
the prov., لَا آتِيكَ مِعْزَى الفِزْرِ, meaning [I will
not come to thee] until the goats of El-Fizr shall
become gathered together; and [that means never,
for] those goats will never become gathered together: (S, O, K:) or, accord. to ISd, this surname was given to him because he said to his
sons, one after another, “Pasture ye these goats,”
and they were incompliant to him; so he called
to the people, “Collect yourselves together; ” and
they did so; and he said, “Take ye them as spoil;
but I do not allow to any one more than one; ”
therefore they separated them at once, and they
became scattered in the country: this was the
origin of the prov.: and one of their provs. relating to leaving a thing undone is the saying, لَا
أَفْعَلُ ذَلِكَ مِعْزَىالفِزْرِ [I will not do that until
the goats of El-Fizr shall become gathered together. (TA.) Accord. to AO, (S, O, TA,) فِزْرٌ
means The kid (S, O, K, TA) itself: (S, O, TA:)
and one says, لَاأَفْعَلُهُ مَا نَزَا فِزْرٌ [I will not do it
as long as a kid leaps]. (TA.) ―

Tekmileh: (TA:) and فِزْرَةٌ signifies the female
young one thereof; (O, K, TA;) or, as some say,
the sister thereof: (TA:) and ↓ فَزَارَةٌ signifies the
female of the بَبْر; (O, Msb, TA;) thus says
IAar, (O,) [and] thus is said in the T: (TA:)

signifies slits, rents, or fissures, and clefts, or

cleaves them as though it made furrows upon their
heads: you say, أَخَذْنَاالفَازِرَ and أَخَذْنَاطَرِيقَ الفَازِرِ,
meaning [We took] the road that made a track
upon the heads and the base of the mountains.
