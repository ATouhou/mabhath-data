فظع1
فَظُعَ الأمْرُ, (S, O, Msb, K,) aor.
فَظُعَ, (O,)
inf. n. فَظَاعَةٌ, (S, O, Msb,) and perhaps فَظَعٌ [respecting which see فَظِعَ]; (Mbr, TA;) as also
↓ افظع; (S, O, Msb, K;) The affair, or event,
was, or became, hard, difficult, or distressing;
bad, evil, abominable, foul, or unseemly; excessive,
or exorbitant: (S:) or excessively bad, evil,
abominable, foul, or unseemly. (O, Msb, K.)
-A2-
And فَظِعَ الأَمْرَ, (K, TA,) thus in the copies of
the K, and in like manner in the O, [where I
find, AZ says, فَظِعْتُ الأَمْرَ, aor. أَفْظَعُهُ,] but [SM
says] in the “ Nawádir ” of AZ, فَظِعَ بِالأَمْرِ, inf. n.
فَظَاعَةٌ, (TA,) He reckoned the affair, or event,
or judged it to be, great, hard, difficult, or distressing, syn. اِسْتَعْظَمَهُ, (K,) or was made to fear, or
be frightened, and was overcome, by it, (AZ, O,
TA,) and trusted not that he had power to accomplish it, or to bear it: (AZ, O, K, TA:) it is said
in a trad., أُرِيتُ أَنَّهُ وُضِعَ فِى يَدَىَّ سَوَارَانِ مِنْ ذَهَبٍ
فَفَظِعْتُهُمَا [I was made to see, meaning I imagined,
or dreamt, that two bracelets of gold were put upon
my arms, and I regarded them with fear]; in
which instance, as IAth says, the verb is thus
made trans. in accordance with its meaning,
which is أَكْبَرْتُهُمَا, and خِفْتُهُمَا: but the phrase
commonly known is فَظِعْتُ بِهِ and مِنْهُ: (TA:)
you say, فَظِعْنُ بِكَذَا I was unable to do, or
accomplish such a thing: (Ibn-'Abbád, O, K: *)
and فَظِعْتُ بِأَمْرِى occurs in a trad. as meaning [I
found that] my affair, or case, was hard, difficult,
or distressing, to me, and I regarded it with fear,
or dread: فَظِعَ بِالأَمْرِ, inf. n. فَظَاعَةٌ and فَظَعٌ,
means He saw the affair, or event, or case, to be
فَظِيع [q. v.]: Mbr says, فَظَعٌ is an inf. n. of فَظِعَ
بِهِ: or it may be an inf. n. of فَظُعَ, like as كَرَمٌ
is of كَرُمَ: but I have not heard it save in the
saying of the poet,
قدْ عِشْتُ فِى النَّاسِ أَطْوَارًا عَلَى خُلُقٍ
شَتَّى وَقَاسَيْتُ فِيهِ اللِّينَ وَالفَظَعَا
[I have lived among men during several periods,
conforming to disposition differing in kind, (عَلَى
خُلُقٍ شَتَّى being like the phrase إِنَّ سَعْيَكُمْ لَشَتَّى,
in the Kur xcii. 4, meaning انّ مَسَاعِيكُمْ لَأَشْتَاتٌ,
as is said in the Ksh and by Bd,) and I have
endured therein softness and hardness]. (TA.)
-A3-
فَظِعَ, (O, K,) aor.
فَظَعَ, inf. n. فَظَعٌ, (O,) said of a
vessel, (K,) It became full. (O, K.)
2
فظّع, inf. n. تَفْظِيعٌ, accord. to Freytag, signifies He described a thing as great: but for this
he names no authority: by “ great ” is here
meant hard, difficult, or distressing; &c.: see 1,
first sentence.]

-A2-
أَفْظَعَنِى الأَمْرُ The affair, or event, made me to
