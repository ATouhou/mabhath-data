opposed to أُصُولٌ meaning “ fundamentals,” signifies, in the conventional language of the lawyers and the men of science in general, the derivative institutes of the law, &c.: see 2:] عِلْمُ
الفُرُوعِ [the science of the derivative institutes of
the law] is what is commonly known by the
appellation of عِلْمُ الفِقْهِ [the science of jurisprudence; because it is mainly concerned with institutes derived from fundamentals]. (Hájjee Khaleefeh.) ―
-b4-  And (tropical:)  The hair of a woman: pl. as
above [app. used in a collective sense like the
French “ cheveux ”]: (K, TA:) one says اِمْرَأَةٌ

(TA.) And (K) (tropical:)  Full [or abundant] hair. (S,
O, K, TA.) ―

divided lengthwise (S, O, K, TA) is called قَوْسٌ
فَرْعٌ; (S, O, TA;) such as is [made from a

(K.)
-A3-  Also, i. e. فَرْعٌ, Property that is beneficial, or serviceable, and made ready, or prepared: (O, K, TA:) or, accord. to the S, it is
↓ فَرَعٌ which has this signification; but this is
said by Sgh [app. in the TS], and after him by
the author of the K, to be a mistake; and a verse
in which it occurs with the ر quiescent is cited in
the O and K as an ex. of it in this sense: it may
be, however, that the poet has made the ر quiescent of necessity [by poetic license, for the sake
of the metre]; or it may here [properly] signify
“ a branch,” and be metonymically used as meaning recent property. (TA.)
-A4-  See also the next
paragraph, latter half.
فَرَعٌ The firstling of the camel, (S, Mgh, O,

they used to sacrifice to their gods, (S, Mgh, O,

Msb;) and ↓ فَرَعَةٌ signifies the same: (Mgh,

amounted to a complete hundred, (K, TA,) he
sacrificed a he-camel thereof every year, and gave
it to the people to eat, neither he nor his family
tasting it, or rather, it is said, (TA,) he sacrificed
a young, or youthful, he-camel to his idol: and
the Muslims used to do it in the first part of ElIslám: then it was abrogated: (K, TA:) accord.
to the Bári' and the Mj, the firstling of camels
and also that of sheep or goats are thus called:
(Msb:) the pl. [of فَرَعٌ] is فُرُعٌ, with two
dammehs. (K.) It is said in a prov., أَوَّلُ الصَّيْدِ
فَرَعٌ [The first of what are taken by the chase or
the like is a فرع] as being likened to a firstling:

Arab. Prov., i. 35.]) ―
-b2-  The poet Ows Ibn-
Hajar, (S, O,) or Bishr Ibn-Abee-Kházim, has
used it as meaning The skin of a فَرَع; (S, O; *)
suppressing the prefix جِلْد: (S:) for they used
to clothe with its skin another young one of a
camel, in order that the mother of the one sacrificed might incline to it [and yield her milk]. (O;
and the like is said in the TA.)
-A2-  Also, and
↓ فَرْعٌ, Lice: (S, K:) or, as some say, small lice:

places of the mountain and descend it]: (S, TA:)

فُرُوعُ الجَوْزَآءِ means The most intense degree of
heat: (S, O, TA:) [or rather الفُرُوعُ is a name of
a certain asterism of الجَوْزَآءُ (which is an appel-lation of Orion and of Gemini, either whereof
may be here appropriately meant,) at the season
of the auroral rising of which the heat becomes
most intense:] Aboo-Khirásh says,

the she-asses: (TA:) and Aboo-Sa'eed related it
as above with the unpointed ع in الفروع: (S, *
TA:) in the same manner, also, it is expl. by
him as used in the phrase فَيْحُ نَجْمِ الفُرُوعِ [which
I would render the vehement raging of the heat of
the asterism of the فروع] in a verse of Umeiyeh
Ibn-Abee-'Áïdh: El-Jumahee related it differently,
with غ; but the فُرُوغ [or rather the فَرْغَانِ] are of
the stars of Aquarius; and the season thereof [i. e.
of their auroral rising] is cold; there is then no
فيح. (TA.)
فُرَيْعٌ, occurring [with tenween, perfectly decl.,]
