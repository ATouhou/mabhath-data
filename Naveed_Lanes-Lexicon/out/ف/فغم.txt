became revealed, disclosed, or divulged; syn. فَشَا.
(K, TA.) ―
-b2-  And Its odour became perceptible,

said of saffron: or, as some relate it, the verb in
that instance is ↓ افغى, which means it flowered,
or blossomed. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And, said of seed-produce
(زَرْع), It dried, became dry, or dried up. (K.)
-A2-  فَغِىَ, aor. يَفْغَى, inf. n. فَغًا, said of dates (تَمْر),
i. q. حشف, [app. a mistranscription, unless there
be such as حَشِفَ, which seems to be not improbable, as one says تَمْرٌ حَشِفَ, and حَشَفٌ also; but
it can hardly be doubted that the meaning is,
They became bad, such as are termed حَشِفٌ or
حَشَفٌ, or, which is nearly the same, such as are
termed فَغًا]: so says Aboo-'Alee El-Kálee. (TA.)
4
افغى It (a plant, S, [app., accord. to the K,
the plant حِنَّآء,]) put forth its فَاغَية [i. e. flower,
or blossom]. (S, K.) See also 1. ―
-b2-  افغت النَّخْلَةُ
The palm-tree became in a bad, or corrupt, state
[with respect to its fruit, as is implied in the S:
i. e. bore dates such as are termed غَفًا]. (S, K.)
―
-b3-  And [hence, app.,] افغى (said of a man, TA)
He became poor after being rich: and He became
ugly after being handsome: and He rebelled after
being obedient: (K, TA:) all from IAar: as
though his state became bad, or corrupt, like as
do unripe dates. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And, said of a man,
He kept constantly to the eating of فَغًا, (K, TA.)
i. e. unripe dates in an altered state. (TA.)
-A2-
And افغى فُلَانًا He angered such a one. (K, TA.)
One says, مَاالَّذِى أَفْغَاكَ [What is it that angered
thee? or, hath angered thee?]. (TA.)
فَغْوٌ: see فَاغِيَةٌ.
فَغًا [or فَغًى] i. q. غَفًا [or غَفًى] in its several
meanings (K, TA) that have been mentioned [in
art. غفو and غفى]: and among these it has that
of The bad of anything. (TA.) And The [refuse
termed] حُثَالَة [q. v.] of wheat. (TA.) And A
dust that comes upon unripe dates, spoiling them,
and rendering them [in the skin] like the wings of
the [locusts, or the like, called] جَنَادِب [pl. of
جُنْدَب]. (TA.) And Unripe dates [themselves]
(S, TA) such as are bad and مُغْبَرّ [i. e. of a hue
like dust]; (S;) or such as are مُتَغَيِّر [i. e. altered
for the worse]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And فَغَا الإِبِلِ The
small, or young, of camels. (TA.)
-A2-  And accord.
to the K, الفَغَا signifies العلبة والجفنةوَمَيَلٌ فِي
الفَمِ; but this is a mistake; correctly it signifies
مَيَلٌ فِى الفَمِ وَالعُلْبَةِ وَالجَفْنَةِ, meaning فِى العُلْبَةِ
وَالجَفْنَةِ [i. e. A distortion in the mouth, and in
the kinds of bowl called عُلْبَة and جَفْنَة], as expl.
by ISd: Kr says that it signifies a certain
malady, which ISd thinks to be a distortion in
the mouth, an explanation given by IAar. (TA.)
فَغْوَةُ الطِّيبِ The odour of perfume; like فَغْمَتُهُ:
(TA in art. فغم:) or the state of spreading of the
odour of perfume. (TA in the present art.)
فَاغِيَةٌ and ↓ فَغْوٌ The flower of the حِنَّآء [i. e. Lawsonia inermis, or Egyptian privet]; (Fr, S, K;)
as also فَاعِيَةٌ: (K in art. فعو or فعى:) or both
signify the flower, or blossom, of anything [i. e.
of any plant, or, app., of any fragrant plant:
see Ham p. 713]: or, as is said in a trad., the
فاغية is the prince, or chief, of the sweet-smelling
plants of Paradise: Sh says that ↓ الفَغْوُ signifies
نَوْر ورَائِحَة طَيِّبَة [a flower, or blossom; and a
sweet odour: but I think that we should read
نَوْرٌ ذُو رَائِحَةٍ طَيِّبَةٍ a sort of flower, or blossom,
having a sweet odour]: and IAar says that the
فاغية is the best and the most fragrant of sweetsmelling plants: (TA:) or it is the flower produced
by a branch of the حِنَّآء that has been planted inverted, and which is sweeter than [that of] the
[common] حِنَّآء. (K.)
