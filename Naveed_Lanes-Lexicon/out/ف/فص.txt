J's saying this does not necessarily mean that it

ISk and El-Fárábee; (Msb;) and ↓ فُصٌّ; (A,

of a horse, إِنَّ فُصُوصَهُ لَظِمَآءٌ (tropical:)  Verily his joints
are hard; not flabby nor fleshy. (S, A.) [And
hence, app., from the place in which it is mentioned by Z in this art., the saying,] فُلَانٌ حَزَّازُ
الفُصُوصِ [in a copy of the A, حَزَّارُ; and in the
TA, ضرار; but I have no doubt that the right
reading is that which I have given; lit., Such a
one is the great cutter of joints;] meaning, (tropical:)  Such
a one is often right in his judgment, or opinion,
