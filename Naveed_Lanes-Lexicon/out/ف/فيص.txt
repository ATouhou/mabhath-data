فيص1
فَاصَ فِى الأَرْضِ, aor. يَفِيصُ, (S, O, K,) inf. n.
فَيْصٌ, (TA,) He went away into the country, or
in the land. (S, O, K.) In the following verse
of Imra-el-Keys,
مَنَابِتُهُ مِثْلُ السُّدُوسِ وَلَوْنُهُ
كَشَوْكِ السَّيَالِ فَهْوَ عَذْبٌ يَفِيصُ
respecting which As said, I know not what is
[the meaning of] يَفِيضُ, this word is said to be
from فاص signifying as expl. above: (S, O:)
[but I do not see what meaning that would be
apposite in this case could be thence derived
without straining:] but فاص signifies also it
shone, or glistened; syn. بَرَقَ; (TA;) and some
say that يفيص in this verse means يَبْرُقُ; (O,
TA;) and the pronoun in مَنَابِتُهُ relates to the
front teeth; (O, * TA;) by عَذْبٌ يَفِيضُ being
meant the lustre (مَآء) thereof: (O:) [accordingly,
the verse may be rendered, The places of growth
thereof, i. e. their gums, were like the (garment
called) سُدُوس, and their colour was like the
thorns of the سَيَال (q. v.), so that they were sweet
and glistening: (see the context in “ the Divans
of the six ancient Arabic poets,” edited by Prof.
Ahlwardt:) or, as some relate the verse, the last
word is ↓ يُفِيصُ, (IB, O, TA,) from مَا أَفَاصَ
بِكَلِمَةٍ [q. v.], (O,) so that it is a denotative of
state, the meaning being عَذْبٌ فِي حَالِ كَلَامِهِ
[i. e. sweet when [displayed in] speaking; or
rather, clearly uttering; but it will be seen below
that يَفِيصُ, as well as يُفِيصُ, may, accord. to the
M and K, be used in this sense:] (IB, TA:) see
4. ―
-b2-  مَا اسْتَطَعْتُ أَنْ أَفِيصَ مِنْهُ, meaning I was
not able to turn aside, or away, from, or to avoid,
him, or it. (S, O.) [See also مَفِيصٌ: and see 4.]
―
-b3-  And وَاللّٰه مَا فِصْتُ, like as one says واللّٰه ما
بَرِحْتُ [perhaps meaning By God I did not
quit my place; as well as I did not cease:]
(S, O, K: *) mentioned on the authority of
AHeyth: (TA:) [that it has the latter meaning
is clear; for] one says, مَا فِصْتُ أَفْعَلُ I did not
cease (مَا بَرِحْتُ) doing [such a thing]: (M:) and
↓ استفاص, likewise, signifies بَرِحَ. (IB, TA.)

افاص الضَّبُّ عَنْ يَدِهِ [The lizard called ضبّ
escaped, or slipped, from his hand, is expl. as
meaning] his fingers became unclosed (اِنْفَرَجَت)
from [the grasp of] the ضبّ, so that it escaped
from him. (M, TA.) And one says, قَبَضْتُ
عَلَيْهِ فَلَمْ يُفِصْ I grasped him and he did not
escape, or get loose. (AHeyth, TA.) And قَبَضْتُ
عَلَى ذَنَبِ الضَّبِّ فَأَفَاصَ مِنْ يَدِى حَتَّى خَلَّصَ ذَنَبَهُ
[I grasped the tail of the ضبّ and it slipped from
my hand so that it freed its tail]: (Lth, S, O, TA:)
[but in the O, مِنْ is omitted before يَدِى; not
intentionally, for the verb before من is there
masc., as above:]) this is when thy fingers
become unclosed (تَتَفَرَّجُ) from the grasp of its
tail: (Lth, O:) and this [state of the fingers] is
termed ↓ التَّفَاوُصُ. (TA.) [It is also said that]
أَفَاصَتِ اليَدُ signifies The fingers of the hand
became unclosed (تَفَرَّجَتْ) from the grasp of the
thing. (K, TA. [But I doubt the correctness of
this.]) ―
-b2-  And الإِفَاصَةُ signifies The being clear,
or perspicuous; syn. البَيَانُ; (O, K;) like
المُفَاوَصَةُ, expl. in art. فوص;] and the being
fluent. (O.) [And also The making speech
clear, or perspicuous.] One says, فُلَانٌ ذُو إِفَاصَةٍ
إِذَا تَكَلَّمَ Such a one is a person endowed with
clearness, or perspicuity, and fluency, when he
speaks. (O.) And افاص لِسَانُهُ بِالكَلَامِ His
tongue made speech, or the speech, clear, or perspicuous; and so ↓ فَاصَ, aor. يَفِيصُ; (M;) and
مَا يَفِيصُ بِهِ لِسَانُهُ, (K, TA,) inf. n. فَيْصٌ, (TA,)
his tongue does not make it clear, or perspicuous
(K, TA.) And مَا أَفَاصَ بِكَلِمَةٍ He did not make
clear, or distinct, or perspicuous, a word, or a sentence. (Yaakoob, S, O, TA.) See also 4 in art.
فوص: and see 1 in the present art. [And it is
said that مَا أَفَاضَ بِكَلِمَةٍ signifies the same. Or,
accord. to Mtr, if he be correctly cited in Har
p. 447, the verb in this sense, and app. as thus
used in all the phrases mentioned above, is correctly with ض, and not so with ص: but this I
greatly doubt.] ―
-b3-  One says also, افاص بِبَوْلِهِ He
ejected his urine: (O, K:) or افاض به. (ElGhooree, in Har ubi suprà.)

التَّفَايُصُ is said to be the original and regular form of التَّفَاوُصُ, which signifies The speaking,
talking, or discoursing, each to another, or each
with another: the ى being changed into و because of the dammeh. (M in this art. and in art.
فوص, and TA.) ―
-b2-  See also another explanation
in art. فوص: and see 4 in the present art.

مَا عَنْهُ مَفِيصٌ There is not any place to which
to turn aside, or away, from it: or there is not
any turning aside, or away, from it: syn. مَحِيدٌ
[which may be meant either as a n. of place
or as an inf. n.]: (As, S, O, K:) or مَعْدِلٌ.
(IAar, M.)
