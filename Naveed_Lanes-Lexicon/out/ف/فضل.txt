فضل1
فَضَلَ, aor.
فَضُلَ; and فَضِلَ, aor.
فَضِلَ; and فَضِلَ,
aor.
فَضُلَ; three syn. dial. vars.; (S, O, Msb, K;) the
second mentioned by ISk; and the third [said to
be] anomalous and unparalleled; (S, O;) [but]
it is a compound of two thereof, (S, O, Msb, K,)
accord. to the companions of Sb, (S, O,) i. e. a
compound of the second and the third, (K,) like
نَعِمَ having for its aor. يَنْعُمُ, (Sb, S, O, Msb,)
and نَكِلَ, aor. يَنْكُلُ, [but this I do not find in its
proper art.,] and حَضِرَ, aor. يَحْضُرُ, [but this is
disallowed by some,] and فَرِغَ, aor. يَفْرُغُ, among
perfect verbs, (Msb,) and مِتَّ, aor. تَمُوتُ, and
دِمْتَ, aor. تَدُومُ, (Sb, S, O, Msb,) and كِدْتَ,
aor. تَكُودُ; (Sb, S;) inf. n. فَضْلٌ: (S, * O, * Msb,
K: *) all signify It exceeded; or was, or became,
redundant, or superfluous; [syn. زَادَ;] being used
in relation to الفَضْلُ (K, MF, TA) meaning
الزِّيَادَةُ, as Ibn-Es-Seed says, (MF, TA,) [i. e.] as
meaning the contr. of النَّقْصُ: (K, TA:) or the
first of the three, i. e. فضَلَ, aor.
فَضُلَ, inf. n. فَضْلٌ,
signifies thus, i. q. زَادَ, (Msb,) and فُضْلٌ and فُضُلٌ
are also inf. ns. [of the same, i. e.] signifying زِيَادَةٌ,
as in the saying, in a trad., accord. to different
relaters, إِنَّ لِلّٰهِ مَلَائِكَةً سَيَّارَةً فُضْلًا عَلَى المَلَائِكَةِ
المُرَتَّبِينَ مَعَ الخَلَائِقِ and فُضُلًا [i. e. Verily to God
belong angels who occupy themselves in ranging
about, in addition to the angels who are stationed
among the created, or human and other, beings]:
(TA:) and all the three dial. vars. mentioned
above signify it remained [of a greater quantity or
number]; syn. بَقِىَ; (S, * O, * Msb;) you say,
فَضَلَ مِنْهُ شَىْءٌ, aor.
فَضُلَ; and فَضِلَ, aor.
فَضَلَ; and فَضِلَ,
aor.
فَضُلَ; somewhat remained thereof: (S, O:) or
from الفَضْلُ as meaning البَقِيَّةُ, you say فَضَلَ like
نَصَرَ, [i. e. aor.
فَضُلَ,] and فَضِلَ like حَسِبَ, [implying that the aor. is
فَضَلَ and
فَضِلَ,] (K,) [accord. to the
TK meaning it had somewhat remaining, but
accord. to SM,] using these verbs [which are said
by him to be like نَصَرَ and سَمِعَ and حَسِبَ, the
last as mentioned by Lh,] in the phrase فَضَلَ مِنْهُ
شَىْءٌ [expl. above]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [فَضَلَ is trans. as
well as intrans.] One says, فَضَلَهُ and فَضَلَ عَلَيْهِ,
[aor.
فَضُلَ,] inf. ns. فَضْلٌ and فُضُولٌ, [but see a distinction made between these two words voce فَضْلٌ,
below,] meaning He, or it, exceeded, or excelled,
him, or it. (MA.) See also 4. [And see فَضْلٌ
below, last signification.] الفَضْلُ as meaning The
overcoming, or surpassing, in highness, elevation,
or eminence, of rank, condition, or estimation, has
but one form of verb, فَضَلَ, aor.
فَضُلَ, like قَعَدَ, aor.
يَقْعُدُ: he who relates the saying of the poet,
وَجَدْنَا نَهْشَلًا فَضَلَتْ فُقَيْمَا
[We found, or have found, that Nahshal (the
tribe so called) overcame &c., or have overcome
&c., Fukeym (another tribe)], pronouncing the
ض [in فضلت] with kesr, errs; not distinguishing
between the two meanings: so says Ibn-Es-Seed,
in the book entitled “ Kitáb el-Fark: ” and Es-
Seymuree says, in his book entitled “ Kitáb etTebsireh,” فَضَلَ, aor.
فَضُلَ, like نَصَرَ, aor. يَنْصُرُ, is
from الفَضْلُ meaning the ruling [others] as a
chief, lord, or master. (TA.) And فَضَلَهُ signifies
also [simply] He overcame him; surpassed him;
or gained ascendency, or the mastery, over him.
(TA.) See also 3.

فضّلهُ (K, TA) عَلَى غَيْرِهِ, (TA,) inf. n.
تَفْضِيلٌ, i. q. مَزَّاهُ, (K, TA,) i. e. He attributed to
him an excellence distinguishing him from [or
above] another, or others: (TA:) or فَضَّلْتُهُ عَلَى
غَيْرِهِ, inf. n. as above, I judged him (S, O, Msb, *
TA) to be more excellent than another, or others:
(S, * O, * Msb, TA: *) or I made him (S, O, Msb, *
TA) to be so. (S, * O, * Msb, TA.) وَفَضَّلْنَاهُمْ عَلَى
كَثِيرٍ مِمَّنْ خَلَقْنَا, in the Kur [xvii. 72, i. e. And
we have made them to excel many of those that we
have created], has been expl. as meaning that the
excellence of the son of Adam consists in his
walking erect, whereas the beasts, the camels
and the asses and the like, walk pronely; and
the son of Adam takes food with his hands,
whereas the other animals take it with the mouth.
(TA.) And وَاللّٰهُ فَضَّلَ بَعْضَكُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ, in the
Kur [xvi. 73, i. e. And God hath made some of
you to excel some others], means, in ability, and
wealth, and rank or station, and power; which
are excellences that may be acquired. (Er-Rághib,
TA.) And you say, فضّلهُ بِهِ, meaning خَصَّهُ [i. e.
He distinguished him particularly, peculiarly, or
specially, by it, namely, a thing]. (A and K in
art. خص.) And فضّل فِى العَطَآءِ He gave to
some more than to others. (S in art. افق.) ―
-b2-  [An
explanation of فضّل given by Golius, as on the
authority of the K, (“ i. q. وسخ, Sordibus infecit,
vel pro sordida habuit, quotidianam vestem,”) is
a strange mistake; app. caused by his finding in
a copy of the K التَّفْضِيلُ التَّوْسِيخُ instead of
التَّفَضُّلُ التَّوَشُّحُ: see 5. ―
-b3-  اِسْمُ التَّفْضِيلِ The noun
of the attribution of excess or excellence is a term
applied to the comparative and superlative noun
or epithet; also called أَفْعَلُ التَّفْضِيلِ, because it
is regularly of the measure أَفْعَلُ: see exs. voce
خَيْرٌ.]
3
الفِضَالُ [and المُفَاضَلَةُ inf. ns. of فَاضَلَ] and
↓ التَّفَاضُلُ [inf. n. of 6 (of which see an ex. in art.
سوى, conj. 6,)] signify التَّمَازِى فِى الفَضْلِ [i. e.
The contending for superiority in excellence]; (K, *
TA;) التَّمَازِى being of the measure تَفَاعُل from
المَزِيَّةُ. (TA.) And you say, ↓ فَاضَلْتُهُ فَفَضَلْتُهُ,
(S, O, K, * in the last فَاضَلَنِى,) aor. of the latter
فَضُلَ,
(TA,) inf. n. فَضْلٌ, (O, TA,) I contended with
him for superiority, or vied with him, in excel-lence, (O, TA,) and I surpassed him, or outvied
him, therein. (S, O, K, TA.) ―
-b2-  And فاضل بَيْنَ
الشَّيْئَيْنِ [app. He made the relation between the
two things to be unequal in respect of excellence;
i. e. he made the two things to be unequal, or
unlike each other, in excellence; contr. of سَاوَى
بَيْنَهُمَا: see also 6]. (TA.)
4
افضل فِى تِجَارَتِهِ He gained; or made gain,
or profit; in his traffic; syn. رَبِحَ. (Az and Msb
in art. ربح.) ―
-b2-  عَنْهُ [and عَنْهُ ↓ فَضَلَ, aor.
فَضُلَ,
inf. n. فَضْلٌ, (see فَضْلٌ below, last signification,
and see also فَاضِلٌ,)] It exceeded it. (K, TA.
[See also 1, latter half.]) Ows says, describing
a bow,
كَقَوْسٍ طِلَاعِ الكَفِّ لَا دُونَ مِلْئِهَا
وَلَا عَجْسُهَا عَنْ مَوْضِعِ الكَفِّ أَفْضَلَا
[Like a bow of which the part that is grasped is
sufficient in size for the filling of the hand, not less
than suffices to fill it, nor does the part that is
grasped thereof extend beyond the place of the
hand: the pret. being here used for the aor. to
suit the metre]. (TA. [But my original has
كَقَوْمٍ, an evident mistranscription.]) ―
-b3-  افضل
عَلَيْهِ: see 5, in two places.
-A2-  أَفْضَلْتُ مِنْهُ الشَّىْءَ
and ↓ اِسْتَفْضَلْتُ signify the same, (S, O, K, TA,)
i. e. I left of it the thing remaining, or redundant.
(O, TA.)
5
تفضّل عَلَيْهِ [in the CK (erroneously) فَضَّلَ]
i. q. تَمَزَّى, (K, TA,) both of which signify He
thought himself to be superior to him in excellence;
(TA in art. مزو;) whence the saying in the Kur
[xxiii. 24], يُرِيدُ أَنْ يَتَفَضَّلَ عَلَيْكُمْ, meaning He
desireth that he may have superiority over you in
rank and station: (TA in the present art.) or
i. q. عليه ↓ افضل, (S, O, Msb, K, TA,) inf. n.
إِفْضَالٌ, (Msb, TA,) i. e. he bestowed, or conferred,
a benefit, or benefits, upon him, syn. أَحْسَنَ, (S,
TA,) or تَطَوَّلَ, (K, TA,) and gave him of his
bounty: (TA:) [and each, followed by بِشَىْءٍ, he
presented him, or favoured him, with a thing:] or
تفضّل signifies, (K,) or signifies also, (S,) he laid
claim to superiority of excellence over his equals,
or fellows; (S, K;) whence [accord. to some] the
saying in the Kur quoted above: (S:) and [you
say] عَلَيْهِ فِى الحَسَبِ ↓ افضل, (K, TA,) meaning
he became possessed of eminence. [or superiority,
over him, in the grounds of pretension to respect
or honour,] as in a verse of Dhu-l-Isba' cited voce
عَنْ, [q. v., p. 2164,] ending with فَتَخْزُوْنِى for
فَتَخْزُوَنِى, [which latter reading I have there
given,] because the rhyme of the whole ode requires the former. (TA.)
-A2-  التَّفَضُّلُ also signifies التَّوَشُّحُ [generally meaning The throwing a
portion of one's garment over his left shoulder,
and drawing its extremity under his right arm,
and tying the two extremities together in a knot
upon his bosom]: and the putting, or disposing,
the extremities of his two garments, or pieces of
cloth, contrariwise, or in contrary directions, upon
his عَاتِق [or part between the shoulder and the
neck]. (K, TA: but in the former, عَلَى عَاتِقَيْهِ is
erroneously put for على عَاتِقِهِ. TA.) ―
-b2-  And
تَفَضَّلَتْ said of a woman in her tent or chamber
or house, She was in a single garment; (S, O,
TA;) [she wore a single garment;] such as is
termed مِفْضَلٌ [q. v.]: (S, TA:) or she (a woman)
wore the garments of her service. (TA.)
6
تَفَاْضَلَ see 3. ―
-b2-  التَّفَاضُلُ بَيْنَ القَوْمِ means The
differing in superiority, or excellence, of some over
others, among the people, or party. (TA.) And
one says, الأَشْيَآءُ تَتَفَاضَلُ [meaning The things are
unequal, or unlike, one to another, in respect of
excellence; contr. of تَتَسَاوَى: see also 3]. (TA.)
10
استفضل أَلْفًا He took a thousand [dirhems]
in excess of his right, or due. (TA.) ―
-b2-  See
also 4.
فَضْلٌ [an inf. n.: (see 1, throughout:) and also
a simple subst., signifying] An exceeding, a redundant, or a superfluous, quantum [of anything,
good or evil]; an excess, a redundance, or a
superfluity; syn. زِيَادَةٌ; (Mgh, Msb;) contr. of
نَقْصٌ: (S, O, K:) [and often meaning superabundance, or exuberance; and surpassingness,
superiority, or excellence. عَلَى غَيْرِهِ over another,
or others, than him, or it: and preponderance:]
the pl. is فُضُولٌ (Mgh, Msb, K:) and this is
sometimes used as a sing.; (Er-Rághib, Msb;)
and [thus used] relates to a thing [or quality] in
which is no good; (Er-Rághib, Mgh, Msb;) by
a predominant application; whence the saying
فُضُولٌ بِلَا فَضْلٍ [excess without excellence]; (Mgh;)
and hence the rel. n. ↓ فُضُولِىٌّ is formed from it:
(Er-Rághib, Msb, TA;) [see this last word, one
of the explanations of which shows that a particular meaning of فُضُولٌ is the quality of busying
oneself with that which does not concern him:]
accord. to Er-Rághib, فَضْلٌ signifies an excess [in
respect of a property or quality, or of an acquisition,] above moderateness; and this is of two
sorts; such as is commended, as the فضل of
knowledge, or science ; and such as is discommended, as the فصل of anger at that whereat
it is not necessary: but فَضَلٌ is more used in
relation to that which is commended; and [the
pl.] فُضُولٌ, in relation to that which is discommended. when the former is used of an excess
[in respect of some attribute, of our of two things
above the other, it is of three sorts; فضل of kind,
as of the animal kind above the vegetable kind;
and of species, as of man above other animals;
and of the individual, as of one man above
another; the first and second of which three are
essential attributes, such that he who is deficient
in [either of] them cannot do away with his
deficiency and acquire فضل, as, for instance, the
horse, and the ass, which cannot acquire the
excellence (فَضِيلَة) of the human being; but the
third may be accidental, such that the way may
be found to acquire it, and of this sort are ability,
wealth, rank or station, and power: and it signifies also any gift whereof the giving to the recipient
thereof is not obligatory: [i. e. a free gift, or
gratuity; and an act of bounty or grace; a
favour; a benefit; and bounty as an abstract
term;] as in the saying [in the Kur iv. 36], وَاسْأَلُوا
اللّٰهَ مِنْ فَضْلِهِ [And ask ye God of his free gift, or
of his bounty, or (as expl. in the Ksh and by Bd)
of his exhaustless treasures]; and in the saying in
the Kur [v. 59 and lvii. 21 and lxii. 4], ذٰلِكَ فَضْلُ
اللّٰهِ يُؤْتِيهِ مَنْ يَشَآءُ [That is the free gift of God;
He giveth it to whom He willeth]; which comprises the three sorts of excellences (فَضَائِل) [mentioned above]: thus says Er-Rághib: El-Muná-
wee says, [explaining one of its meanings,] in the
“ Towkeef,” that it is the commencing, or originating, of an act of beneficence without an efficient
cause [i. e., app., not by reason of any obligation].
(TA.) ―
-b2-  Also A portion remaining, (K, TA,)
of a thing, such as food &c., and of water in the
leathern water-bag, and of wine or beverage in
the vessel; (TA;) and ↓ فَضْلَةٌ and ↓ فُضَالَةٌ signify
the same, (K, TA,) or a redundant portion (S
and O and Msb in explanation of these two
words) of a thing: (S, O:) whence the saying of
the vulgar, ↓ لِلْفَضِيلِ ↓ الفَضْلَةُ i. e. The remaining
portion of the wine or beverage [is for the excel-lent]. (TA.) It is said in a trad., لَا يُمْنَعُ فَضْلُ
المَآءِ لِيُمْنَعَ بِهِ الكَلَأُ [The redundance of water shall
not be denied that the herbage be thereby denied]:
(TA, in the present art.:) meaning that when
there is a well in the desert, with herbage near
it, and a person prevents others from drawing
water, he thereby prevents the latter from availing themselves of the herbage; for when a man
comes with his camels, and pastures them upon
that herbage, and does not then water them,
thirst kills them. (TA in art كلأ,) And it is
said in another trad., فَضْلُ الإِزَارِ فِى النَّارِ [The
redundant portion of the waist-wrapper is in the
fire of Hell]; meaning what one drags [thereof]
upon the around, by reason of pride. (TA;) And
one says, فِى يَدِهِ فَضْلُ الزِّمَامِ, meaning [In his
hand is] the end of the زمام [or nose-rein of the
camel]. (TA.) ذَاتُ الفُضُولِ and ↓ الفضُولِ, with
damm and with fet-h, [The thing having redundant portions] is the name of the coat of mail of
the Prophet, which was thus called because
having redundance and ampleness. (TA.) فُضُولُ
الغَنَائِمِ means The remains of the spoils when they
are divided (TA;) such as a single horse, or a
single camel (KL.) And by the فُضُول of women
are meant The remains of the menstrual discharge
(Ham p. 107: see, there, explanations of a verse
in which this occurs.) (??) [The confederacy, or covenant, of the فضول, a word
which is here of uncertain meaning,] is thus explained: Háshim and Zuhrah and Teym [accord.
to the CK Teymà] went in to 'Abd-Allah Ibn-Jud'án, and united in a confederacy to repel
wrongdoing, and to exact the due from the
wrongdoer; and it was thus called because they
bound themselves by their confederacy not to
leave in the possession of any one aught remaining [of property] whereof he aught despond any
one, without their taking it for him [i. e. the
latter] from him [i. e. the former] (O, K, TA:
[in the CK, يَظْلِمُهُ أَحَدٌ is a mistake for يظلمه
أَحَدًا:]) or it was thus called as being likened to
a confederacy, or covenant, which was made of
old, at Mekkeh, in the days of Jurhum, to act
with mutual equity, and to take for the weak
from the strong, and for the stranger from the
resident, and in which three men, every one of
whom was named El-Fadl, joined: and it was also
called that of the مَطَيَّبُون. (TA. [See art. طيب.])
―
-b3-  The saying لَا يَمْلِكُ دِرْهَمًا فَضْلًا عَنْ دِينَارٍ, and
the like may be said of other sayings similar to
it, means He does not possess a dirhem nor a
deenár [or rather much less a deenár]: it is as
though one said, he does not possess a dirhem:
how then should he possess a deenár? for the
negation of that which is much is a necessary
consequence of the negation of that which is
little: فَضْلًا is here in the accus case as an inf. n.;
the implied meaning being فَقَدَ مِلْكَ دِرْهَمٍ فَقْدًا
يَفْضُلُ عَنْ فَقْدِ مِلْكِ دينَارٍ [or rather يَفْقِدُ &c.,
i. e. he lacks the possession of a dirhem with a
lacking exceeding the lacking of the possession of a
deenár]: (Msb:) Kutb-ed-Deen Esh-Sheerázee
says, (Msb, TA,) in the Expos. of the “ Miftáh,”
(TA,) فَضْلًا is used in a case in which the inferior
[of two things] is deemed a thing of which the
existence is improbable, and the impossibility of
the existence of a thing that is above it is meant
thereby; wherefore it occurs between two phrases
differing in meaning; and it is mostly used after
a particle of negation: (Msb, TA:) AHei says
that he had not found any authority for it in the
[classical] language of the Arabs. (Msb. [See
also بَلْهَ, which is used in a somewhat similar
manner.])
فُضُلٌ Wearing a single garment, such as is
termed مِفْضَلٌ; an epithet applied to a woman;
(S, Mgh, * O, K;) and also to a man; (S, O, K;)
like ↓ مُتَفَضِّلٌ: (O, K:) it is of the dial. of Nejd;
like فُرُجٌ in the dial. of El-Yemen. (L in art. فرج.)
―
-b2-  And A woman proud, or self-conceited, or so
in her gait; who makes a portion of her skirt to
be redundant [so that it drags upon the ground
when she walks]. (TA.) ―
-b3-  See also مِفْضَلٌ, in
three places.
فَضْلَةٌ: see فَضْلٌ, former half, in two places. ―
-b2-
[Hence, as used by grammarians,] A dispensable
member of a proposition; such as the objective
complement of a verb, when the suppression
thereof is not detrimental [to the meaning];
contr. of عُمْدَةٌ. (I'Ak, p. 143) [The pl. is
فَضَلَاتٌ.] ―
-b3-  And The clothes that are used for
sleeping [therein]: (K, TA:) [so called] because
they are an addition over and above the clothes
that are used on various [other] occasions. (TA.)
―
-b4-  And Wine; and so ↓ فِضَالٌ [which see also in
what here follows]: (O, K:) الفَضْلَةُ is mentioned
by A'Obeyd as a name for wine: (O:) or it
signifies, accord. to AHn, the wine that alters [or
has become altered] in colour after oldness; and
ISd says that it is so called because the choice, or
best, or most excellent, part thereof [for لأنّ
حميمها in my original (an obvious mistranscription) I read لِأَنَّ صَمِيمَهَا ] is what remains: (TA:)
the pl. is فَضَلَاتٌ and فِضَالٌ [the latter word mentioned above as a syn. of فَضْلَةٌ]. (K.)
فِضْلَةٌ is a n. of the same kind as جِلْسَةٌ and
رِكْبَةٌ: (AZ, S, O, TA:) one says, إِنَّهُ لَحَسَنُ
الفِضْلَةِ, meaning [Verily he is comely in respect of]
the manner of wearing a single garment. (S, * O, *
K, * TA.)

i. q. ↓ مُتَفَضِّلُونَ, (O, K, TA,) i. e. [Men] who

فُضُولِىٌّ a rel. n. formed from فُضُولٌ as pl. of
فَضْلٌ but used as a sing.: (Er-Rághib, Msb, TA:)
see فَضْلٌ, near the beginning: One who busies
himself with that which does not concern him. (Er-Rághib, Mgh, O, Msb, TA.) In the conventional
language of the lawyers, One who is not a commissioned agent, (Mgh, O, KT, TA,) nor a guardian (وَلِىّ), (KT, TA,) nor a proprietor, (TA,)
nor a person of firm judgment (أَصِيلٌ), in a contract. (KT.) The pronunciation with fet-h to
the ف is a mistake. (Mgh, O.) ―
-b2-  Also A tailor.
(IAar, O, K.)
فَضَّالٌ: see مِفْضَالٌ.
فَاضِلٌ [act. part. n. of فَضَلَ: as such signifying
Exceeding; &c.]. One says, مَالُ فُلَانٍ فَاضِلٌ i. e.
[The wealth, or property, of such a one is superfluous; or] abundant, or much in quantity, such
as has exceeded the supply of food sufficient to
sustain life (فَضَلَ عَنِ القُوتِ). (TA.) ―
-b2-  And
[Excelling; or excellent, as also ↓ فَضِيلٌ, of which
the pl. is فُضَلَآءُ, but which is probably postclassical: or it is] applied to a man as [a possessive epithet] meaning possessing فَضْل [i. e. excel-lence]. (TA.) [And conventionally, Erudite; or
excellent in learning.] ―
-b3-  See also مَفْضُولٌ.
فَاضِلَةٌ is a subst. from فَضِيلَةٌ [app. as a concrete
term, signifying An excellent thing, or an excel-lent action; each as distinguished from an excel-lent quality]; (K, TA;) pl. فَوَاضِلُ: (TA:) [but
generally] it signifies a gift, or thing that is given:
(Ham p. 431, and Har p. 184:) or a benefit, or
benefaction: or such as is continual, or uninterrupted: (MA:) pl. as above: (Ham and Har,
ubi suprà; and MA:) [or] فَوَاضِلُ signifies benefits,
or benefactions, that are goodly, or pleasing,
(IDrd, O, K,) or such as are great, or large.
(K.) And فَوَاضِلُ المَالِ signifies What accrues
to one of the proceeds and profits of property, (O,
K, TA,) of the increase of lands and palm-trees

فضو and فضى
1
فَضَا, (M, Msb, K,) aor. يَفْضُو, (M, Msb,)
inf. n. فُضُوٌّ (M, Msb, K) and فَضَآءٌ, (M, K,) It (a
place) was, or became, wide, or spacious; (M,
Msb, K;) as also ↓ افضى; (TA as from the K,
in which I do not find it;) the latter occurring in
a trad., and expl. in the Nh as signifying it became
a فَضَآء [q. v.]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [And It was, or became,
empty, vacant, or void; (for it is said in the TA
that الفضو, by which الفُضُوُّ is evidently meant,
signifies الخُلُوُّ;) as also ↓ افضى, as appears from
an explanation of the part. n. مُفْضٍ, q. v.] ―
-b3-
فَضَا الشَّجَرُ بِالمَكَانِ, inf. n. فضو [i. e. فُضُوٌّ], The
trees became numerous, or abundant, [so as to
occupy much space,] in the place. (IKtt, TA.)
―
-b4-  And فَضَا دَرَاهِمَهُ He did not put his dirhems,
or money, into the purse [app. meaning that he
left his money strewn]. (K.)
4
افصى: see the preceding paragraph, in two
places. ―
-b2-  Also He went forth, (S,) or came,
(TA,) to the فَضَآء [q. v.]. (S, TA.) ―
-b3-  [Hence]
افضى فُلَانٌ إِلَى فُلَانٍ Such a one came to, or
reached, such a one: (M, Mgh, TA:) originally,
became in the space, or the place, or quarter, of
such a one: (M:) or properly, became in the فَضَآء
of such a one. (Mgh.) And in like manner,
افضى إِلَيْهِ الأَمْرُ [The thing, or event, came to, or
reached, him]. (M.) And أَفْضَيْتُ إِلَى الشَّىْءِ I
came to, or reached, the thing. (Msb.) Accord.
to IAar, (TA,) الإِفْضَآءُ properly signifies الاِنْتِهَآءُ
[i. e. The coming at last, or ultimately, or the
reaching, to a person or thing]. (IAar, T, Msb,
TA.) Hence the saying [in the Kur iv. 25],
وَقَدْ أَفْضَى بَعْضُكُمْ إِلَى بَعْضٍ i. e. When one of you
hath come, and betaken himself, to the other;
(TA;) in which the verb is made trans. by means
of إِلَى because having the meaning [of اِنْتَهَى or]
of وَصَلَ: (M:) or this means, when one of you
hath become alone with the other, agreeably with
the original derivation; or, accord. to some, it is
an allusion to mutual contact, skin to skin: or to
copulation. (Mgh.) You say, افضى إِلَى امْرَأَتِهِ
[He went in to his wife: or] he became in contact
with his wife, skin to skin: (S, Msb:) or it signifies, (M, K,) or signifies also, (S, Msb,) (tropical:)  he
compressed his wife: (S, M, Msb, K:) or he was,
or became, with her alone in private, whether he
compressed her or not. (M, K.) ―
-b4-  افضى بِهِمْ He
reached with them, or brought them to, a wide, or
spacious, place. (TA.) And افضى بِهِ الطَّرِيقُ إِلَى
وَعْرٍ مِنَ الأَرْضِ [The road brought him to a rugged
tract of land]. (K * and TA in art. وعر) ―
-b5-
افضى بِيَدِهِ إلَى الأَرْضِ He touched the ground with
the palm of his hand (IF, S, Msb, K) in his prostration [in prayer]. (S, K.) And أَفْضَيْتُ إِلَيْهِ
بِيَدِى مِنْ غَيْرِ حَائِلٍ I put my hand to it without
anything intervening; i. q. مَسَسْتُهُ (Msb in art
مس.) ―
-b6-  أَفْضَيْتُ إِلَى فَلَانٍ بِسِرِى [I communicated,
or made known, to such a one my secret]: (S;) or

(Msb. TA.) ―
-b7-  افضى also signifies (assumed tropical:)  He became
poor: so says IAar: as though he came to the
ground. (TA.)
-A2-  لَا يُفْضِى اللّٰهُ فَاكَ, occurring
in a trad., is a phrase expressive of a prayer,
meaning May God not make thy mouth wide and
empty. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Hence the saying of IAar,
الإِفْضَآءُ أنْ تَسْقُطَ الثَّنَايَا مِنْ تَحْتُ وَمِنْ فَوْقُ [app.
meaning that اِفْضَآءٌ is the inf. n. of أُفْضِىَ signifying His central incisors, below and above, fell out:
or he was caused to lose them]: and hence [the
epithet] المُفْضَاةُ [and therefore hence also what
here follows]. (TA.) ―
-b3-  افضى المَرْأَةَ He made
the woman's مَسْلَكَانِ (i. e. her vagina and rectum,
Msb) to become one, (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K, TA,)
in devirginating her, (Msb,) or in compressing
her; (TA;) the intervening part becoming rent:
(Mgh, TA:) and so أَفَاضَهَا: (M, in which it is
mentioned in art. فضى:) the epithet applied to
her is ↓ مُفْضَاةٌ, (M, Mgh, Msb, K,) which is syn.
with شَرِيمٌ. (S.)

تَفَضَّيْتُ for تَفَضَّضْتُ see in art. فض (conj. 5).
―
-b2-  [التفضّى in a passage of the Fákihet el-Khulafà accord. to several copies thereof is an
obvious mistake for التَّفَصِّى, with the unpointed
ص: see Freytag's Critical Annotations and Corrections in his edition of that work, p. 6.]
فَضًا, (S, M, K,) also written فَضًى, (TA,) A

فَضًا Mixed food: (S:) and تَمْرٌ فَضًا dates mixed,
(AA, * S, M,) as, for instance, (S, TA,) with
raisins, (Lh, S, M, TA,) in one vessel, or bag;
thus says El-Kálee; (TA;) or scattered, or strewn,
and mixed; (M:) and تَمْرَانِ فَضَيَانِ [two sorts of
dates mixed]: and تُمُورٌ أَفْضَآءٌ [several sorts of
dates mixed]. (AA, TA.) And مَتَاعُهْمٌ فَوْضَى
فَضًا Their goods are mixed together: (M:) or are
shared in common. (TA.) And أَمْرُهُمْ فَضًا بَيْنَهُمْ
[Their case is mixed, or promiscuous, &c., like
أَمْرُهُمْ فَوْضَى بَيْنَهُمْ (q. v. in art. فوض); or] their
case among themselves is alike; (M, TA;) i. e.
they have no commander over them. (S, TA.) And

his garment to any one's care. (M, TA.) ―
-b2-  [Also
One; a single thing or person: and alone; by
itself or himself; not having any other with it or
him; apart from others: thus it has two contrmeanings.] You say سَهْمٌ فَضًا One, or a single,
arrow. (K:) or an arrow that is alone, by itself,
not having any other with it, in the quiver. (AA,
TA.) And بَقِيتَ فَضًا I remained alone, (Az, K,
TA,) of such as were fellows: (Az, TA:) or
a part from my brethren and my family. (Akh,
TA)
-A2-  Also, i. e. فَضًا, (M, K,) or correctly
with ى [i. e. (??)], as written by El-Kálee, (TA,)

-A3-  See also what next follows.
فَضْيَةٌ Water collecting and stagnating: pl. فِضَاءٌ,
with medd, accord. to Kr: and also ↓ فَضًى and
فِصًى, with fet-h and with kesr, the former of
these like حَلَقٌ as pl. [or rather a quasi-pl. n.] of
حَلْقَةٌ, and the latter like بِدَرٌ as a pl. of بَدْرَةٌ;
occurring in different relations of a verse of 'Adee
Ibn-Er-Rikáa. (M in art. فضى, and TA.)
فَضَآءٌ is an inf. n.: (M, K, TA:) and is expl.
by Aboo-'Alee El-Kálee as signifying Width, or
spaciousness. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [It is also used as an
epithet:] see فَاضٍ. ―
-b3-  And [as a subst., or an
epithet in which the quality of a subst. is predominant,] it signifies A court, an open area, or
a yard, of a house; syn. سَاحَةٌ: (S, K:) and a
wide, or spacious, tract of land: (ISh, S, M, K:)
or a plain and wide expanse of land: (Sh, TA:)
the pl. is أَفْضِيةٌ. (ISh, TA.)
فِضَآءٌ Water running upon the ground: (K:)
or, accord. to Aboo-'Alee El-Kálee it is [in
measure, but not exactly in meaning,] like حِسَآءٌ
[a pl. of حِسْىٌ], signifying water running upon
the surface of the earth; [or rather waters &c.;
for he adds,] and its sing. is ↓ فَضِيَّةٌ: in the M,
[in art. فضى,] it is said to be a pl. of فَضْيَةٌ,
[q. v.,] on the authority of Kr. (TA.)
فَضِيَّةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
فَاضٍ (Msb, TA) and ↓ مُفْضٍ (M, * TA) Wide,

Er-Rághib, Mgh, Msb, TA,) open and plain,
