فصى1
فَصَىَ الشَّىْءَ مِنَ الشَّىْءِ, (M, K,) or عَنِ الشَّىْءِ,
(Msb, and so in the TA,) improperly written in
the copies of the K فصا, (TA,) aor. يَفْصِيهِ, (Msb,
K,) inf. n. فَصْىٌ, (M, Msb,) He separated the
thing from the thing; (M, K;) or removed it
therefrom: (Msb:) whence فصى اللحم عن العظم
[evidently meaning فَصَى الَّحْمَ عَنِ العَظْمِ i. e.
He separated, or removed, the flesh from the
bone]: (TA:) [but in both of my copies of the
S, I find فَصَىَ الَّحْمُ عَنِ العَظْمِ, as though فَصَى
were used as syn. with تفصّى and انفصى, meaning The flesh became freed, or cleared, from the
bone: perhaps a mistake of copyists; though it
is immediately added,] and مِنْهُ ↓ فَصَّيْتُهُ, inf. n.
تَفْصِيةٌ, i. e. I freed it, or cleared it, from it; (S,
K;) or, accord, to Fr, this signifies I separated
it from it, i. e., anything from another thing.
(Har p. 640.)

فَصَّىَ see the preceding paragraph.

فاصاهُ, inf. n. مُفَا صَاةٌ, as is related on the
authority of Er. Rázee, but accord, to analogy,
not on the ground of received usage, means He
separated himself from him; left, forsook, or
abandoned, him: or forsook, or abandoned, him,
being forsaken, or abandoned, by him, syn. فَارَقَهُ.
(Har p. 640.)

أَفْصَىَ see 5. ―
-b2-  افصى عنْكَ الحَرُّ means The heat
departed, or has departed, from thee: but you
do not say افصى عنك البَرْدُ: (ISk, S, M: but in
the M, عنك is omitted in both phrases:) or you
say, افصى عنَّا الشِّتَآءُ, and الحَرُّ, the winter, and the
heat, departed from as; or left, or quitted, us;
(K, TA;) so says Az, on the authority of IAar:
(TA:) or, accord, to IAar, افصى عَنْكَ الشِّتَآءُ [the
winter departed, or has departed, from thee];
and سقَطَ عَنْكَ الحرُّ. (M, TA.) And افصى المَطَرُ
The rain cleared away. (S, M, K.) ―
-b3-  افصى
said of a sportsman, He had no game caught in
his snare. (K.)

تفصّى, said of flesh, or flesh-meat, It became
separated, or detached, عَنِ العَظْمِ [from the bone];
as also ↓ انفصى; (M;) which is said of anything
that was sticking. (Lth, TA.) He became freed,
free, or released, [and in like manner said of a
thing of any kind,] مِنْهُ [from him, or it]; S,
M, Msb, K;) i. e., from another man, (S,) from
his adversary, or antagonist; (Msb;) from a
thing; (M;) from debts; (S, Msb; *) from straitness, or difficulty, (S, Msb, TA,) or from trial, or
affliction; (S, TA;) or from good, or evil; as
also ↓ افصى (K.) And He, or it, went forth, or
departed, مِنَ الشَّىْءِ [from the thing]; as also
↓ انفصى, and ↓ استفصى. (Msb.) أَشَدُّ تَفَصِّيًا means
أَشَدُّتَفَلُّتًا: (Msb, TA:) thus in the trad. respecting the Kur-án, لَهُوَ إَشَدُّ تَفَصِّيًا مِنْ قُلُوبِ الرِّجَالِ
مِنَ النَّعَمِ [Verily it is more apt to escape from
the breasts of men than are pasturing camels, or
cattle, from their pastor]. (TA. [In my original,
the last word in this saying is without any vowel-sign; but it is not doubtful, as the trad. is well
known.])

إِنْفَصَىَ see the next preceding paragraph, in two
places.

إِسْتَفْصَىَ see 5, last sentence but one.
فَصًى, (M, K, * TA,) incorrectly written in the
copies of the K with ا (TA,) The stones (حَبّ) of
raisins: (M, K:) also mentioned in the K [and
M] as with ض: (TA:) n. un. (??): (M, K:)
of the dial. of El-Hijáz: and they also call the
stones of dates فصية [app. (??), pl. of فَصى, like
as فِتْيَةٌ is pl. of فَتًى]. (TA.)
فَصْيَةٌ the subst, from تَفَصَّى as syn. with تَخلَّصَ;
(S, M, Msb, K;) [thus signifying Freedom. or
release, from a thing or state;] primarily denoting
one's being in a thing and then coming, or going,
forth, or departing, from it; (S;) as also ↓ فصيّةٌ.
(K.) Hence the saying, قَضَى اللّٰهُ لِى بِالفَصْيَةِ مِنْ
هٰذَا الأَمْرِ [God decreed for me, or may God
decree for me, freedom, or release, from this
affair, or case]. (A, TA.) ―
-b2-  فَصْيةُ مَا بَيْنَ الحَرِّ
وَالبَرْدِ means An intermission (سَكْتَةٌ, lit, a quiescence,) between heat and cold: and one says لَيْلَةٌ
فَصْيَةٌ and يَوْمٌ فَصْيَةٌ [A night that is, or that was,
one of intermission, and a day &c.], and لَيْلَةُ فَصْيَةٍ
and يَوْمُ فَصْيَةٍ [meaning the same], (M, K.)
فَصِيَّةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
