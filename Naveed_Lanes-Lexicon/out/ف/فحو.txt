فحو1
فَحَا بِكَلَامِهِ إِلَى كَذَا, (Msb, TA,) aor. يَفْحُو
[like يَعْلُو], the verb being of the class of عَلَى,
(so in the Msb accord. to the TA,) or يَفْحَى [like
يَنْفَعُ], the verb being of the class of نَفَعَ, (so
accord. to my copy of the Msb,) or, as in copies
of the T, يَفْحِى, without teshdeed, the verb being
of the class of رَمَى, (TA, [but this is app. a mistranscription for يَفْحَى, as the last radical letter
is و,]) inf. n. فَحْوٌ; (Msb, TA;) or بكلامه ↓ فحّى
الى كذا, thus accord. to the K, agreeably with
what is said by J; (TA;) [but one of my copies
of the S has إِنَّهُ لَيَفْحَى بِكَلَامِهِ إِلَى كَذَا وَكَذَا;
the other copy having ↓ لَيُفَحِّى;] He meant, or
intended, by his saying, or speech, such a thing.
(Msb, K, TA. [In the S, the meaning is only
indicated by the context.])
-A2-  بَكَى حَتَّى فَحِىَ,
like رَضِىَ, He (a child) wept until he sobbed.
(TA.)

فحّى القِدْرَ, inf. n. تَفْحِيَةٌ, He made the
cooking-pot to have a large quantity of أَبَازِير [or
seeds used in cooking, for seasoning the food: from
فَحًا, q. v.]: (S, * K, TA:) or, accord. to Aboo-
'Alee El-Kálee, he put, or threw, into the cookingpot, أَبَازِير, i. e. تَوَابِل. (TA.) It is said, by Z,
[but with hardly any reason that I can see,] to
be formed by transposition from the letters فوح
thus combined. (TA.)
-A2-  See also 1, in two
places.
3
فَاحَيْتُهُ, inf. n. مُفَاحَاةٌ, I talked, discoursed,
or held a colloquy, with him, and understood what
he intended, or meant. (A, TA.)
فَحًا and فِحًى, (S, K,) the former of which is
the more common, (S,) The seeds that are used
in cooking, for seasoning the food; (S, K;) as
also ↓ فَحْوَآءُ: or the dry thereof: (K:) pl. أَفْحَآءٌ;
(S, K;) which is said by IAth to signify the
[seeds called] تَوَابِل of the cooking-pot, such as
pepper and cumin-seed and the like thereof. (TA.)
And it is said to signify particularly The onion,
or onions collectively. (TA.) Thus in a trad. of
Mo'áwiyeh, in which he is related to have said
to a party who came to him, كُلُوا مِنْ فَحَا أَرْضِنَا
فَقَلَّ مَا أَكَلَ قَوْمٌ مِنْ فَحَا أَرْضٍ فَضَرَّهُمْ مَاؤُهَا [Eat
ye of the seasoning of our land (meaning of the
onions,) for rarely have people eaten of the seasoning of a land and the water thereof has harmed
them]. (TA: and the like is said in the S, but
not so fully.)
فَحْوَةٌ i. q. شَهْدَةٌ [A portion of honey; or a
honey-comb; or a portion of a honey-comb]. (K,
TA. [It is added in the latter that it is as though
it were formed by transposition from فَوْحَة; which
I do not find in this sense in any lexicon.])
فَحْيَةٌ, like جَرْيَةٌ; (so in some copies of the K,
and accord. to the TA, in which it is said to be
“ with fet-h; ”) or فِحْيَةٌ, like جِرْيَةٌ; (so in other
copies of the K; [but I think that both are evidently wrong, because deviating from a common
rule of the K, and for more than one other obvious
reason; and that the right reading is ↓ فِحِّيَّةٌ, like
جِرِّيَّةٌ (accord. to those who hold this to be of the
measure فِعِّيلَةٌ, not فِعْلِيَّةٌ); i. e., that it is originally فِحِّيوَةٌ, the و being necessarily changed into
ى and incorporated into the preceding ى;] and
also ↓ فَحِيَّةٌ; (K, TA;) the former on the authority of AA, and the latter on that of IAar; (TA;)
Thin soup: (K, TA: [in some copies of the K,
حَشْو is erroneously put for حَسْو or حَسُوّ, the
readings in other copies:]) or soup in general.
(K, TA.)
فَحْوَى and ↓ فَحْوَآءُ, (T, S, Msb, K, &c.,) the
latter sometimes used, (Msb,) but AZ is said to
have disallowed the pronunciation with the lengthened alif, (TA,) and ↓ فُحَوَآءُ, (K, TA,) this last
mentioned by ISd and Sgh on the authority of
Fr, (TA,) The meaning of a saying, or speech;
its intended sense or import; syn. مَعْنًى; (S, Msb,
K;) and مَذْهَبٌ; (K;) and لَحْنٌ. (S, Msb.) One

in, or from, the intended sense or import of his
saying, or speech; or,] in [or from] what I elicited
of his meaning, or intent, in what he said. (A.)
