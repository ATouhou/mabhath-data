andفُيُوضٌ (M, O, K) and فِيُوضٌ and فُيُوضَةٌ (M,
K) and فَيَضَانٌ, (M, O, K,) It (water) overflowed:
poured out, or forth, from fulness: (Mgh:) it
(water, S, O, K, or a torrent, Msb) became abundant, (S, O, Msb, K and flowed from [over] the
brink of the valley, (Msb,) or so as to flow over
the side of the valley, (S, O,) or so as to flow like
a valley; (K;) and ↓ افاض signifies the same:
(Msb, TA:) it (water) became abundant: (TA:)
[contr. of غَاضَ, aor. يَغِيضُ:] it (water, and that

out, or forth; or poured out, or forth, vehemently;
gushed out, or forth: (M:) and it (water, and
blood,) fell in drops. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  It (a vessel)
became full: (Msb:) [or it overflowed: for you
say,] فَاضَ النَّهْرُ بِمَائِهِ The river overflowed with
its water: and فَاضَ الإِنَآءُ بِمَا فِيهِ The vessel overflowed with what was in it: (Msb:) and a poet
says,
شَكَوْتُ وَمَا الشَّكْوَى لِمِثْلِىَ عَادَةً
وَلٰكِنْ تَفِيضُ الكَأْسُ عِنْدَ امْتِلَائِهَا
[I complained; and complaint is not a custom of
the like of me; but the cup overflows on the occasion of its being full]. (A) You say also فَاضَتْ
عَيْنُهُ, aor. as above, inf. n. فَيْضٌ, The eye flowed
[with tears]. (TA.) And فَاصَ عَرَقًا, said of a man,
[He sweated;] sweat appeared upon his body, on
an occasion of grief. (IKtt) ―
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  It (a thing)
was, or became, much, abundant, many, or unmerous. (O, K.) You say, فَاضَ اللِّئَامُ (assumed tropical:)  The
mean became many: (S, O:) opposed to غَاضَ,
q. v. (S and A in art. غيض.) And فَاضَ الخَيْرُ
(tropical:)  Good, or wealth, &c., became abundant, (A,
Msb,) فِيهِمْ among them. (A.) ―
-b4-  Aor. as above,
(S,) inf. n. فَيْضٌ, (TA,) (tropical:)  It (a piece of news, or
a story,) spread abroad; (S, M, K;) as also
↓ استفاض; (S, M, A, Msb, K, TA;) it spread
abroad among the people. (Msb and TA in explanation of the latter verb,) like water. (TA.)
↓ The latter is also said of a place, meaning (tropical:)  It
became wide, or ample. (A.) And you say, فَاضَ
عَلَيْهِ الدِّرْعُ (tropical:)  [The coat of mail spread over him;
or covered him]. (A.) ―
-b5-  Aor. as above, inf. n.
فَيْضٌ and فُيُوضٌ, (tropical:)  He (a man, S, O, K) died: (S,
M, O, K:) and, (S, M, O, K,) in like manner,
(S, O,) فَاضَتٌ نَفْسُهُ, (S, M, A, Mgh, O, Msb, K,)
aor. as above, (M,) inf. n. فَيْضٌ, (M, Msb,) (tropical:)  his
soul departed, or went forth; (S, M, A, * Mgh, *
O, Msb, K;) of the dial. of Temeem; (S, M, O;)
on the authority of AO and Fr; and AZ says the
like; but As says that one should not say, فاض
الرَّجُلُ, nor فاضت نفسه, for فاض is only said of
tears and of water: (S, O:) to which is added
in the O, but one says, فَاظَ, with ظ, [as is also
said in the Mgh,] as meaning “ he died,” and
not فاض, with ض, decidedly: (TA:) [see, however, the remarks of IB below:] or the more
chaste expression is فاظ, with ظ, without the
mention of the نفس; and some do not allow any
other: (Msb:) but in the L we find as follows:
IAar says. فاض الرجل and فاظ, meaning “ the
man died: ” and Abu-l-Hasan says, فاظت نفسه,
the verb relating to the نفس; and فاض الرجل
and فاظ: but As says, I heard AA say that one
should not say, فاظت نفسه, but فاظ, meaning
“ he died; ” and not فاض, with ض, decidedly:
IB, however, says that what IDrd has cited
from As is different from that which J has
ascribed to him; for IDrd cites the words of As
thus: the Arabs says, فاظ الرجل, meaning “ the
man died; ” but when they speak of the نفس,
they say فاضت نفسه, with ض; and he quotes
the ex.
فَفُقِئَتْ عَيْنٌ وَفَاضَتْ نَفْسُ
[And an eye was put out, and a soul departed]:
and he [IB] adds that this is what is commonly
known to be the opinion of As: but J has committed and error; for As quotes from AA that one
should not say, فاظت نفسه, but فاظ, meaning “ he
died; ” not فاض, decidedly and he also says,
nor does it necessarily follow from what he relates that he firmly believed it: AO says that
فاظت نفسه is of the dial. of Keys; and فاضت,
of the dial of Temeem and AHát says, I heard
AZ say that Benoo-Dabbeh alone say, فاضت نفسه:
in like manner also El-Mázinee says. on the
authority of AZ. that all the Arabs say, فاظت
نفسه. except Benoo-Dabbeh, who say, فاضت نفسه
with ض. (TA.) [See also art. فيظ. It is further said, that] الفَيْضُ signifies Death: (A, K;)
as occurring in a trad respecting Ed-Dejjál,
where it is said, ثُمَّ يَكُونُ عَلَى أَثَرِ ذٰلِكَ الفَيْضُ
[Then shall be, after that, death] (A, TA:) Sh
says, I asked El-Bekráwee respecting this, and
he asserted الفيض, in this case, to signify
“ death; ” but I have not heard it from any
other; unless it be from فَاضَتْ نَفْسَهُ signifying
His slaver collecting upon his lips at the departure
of his soul [flowed]. (TA.) ―
-b6-  You say also فَاضَ
صدْرُهُ مِنَ الغَيْظِ (tropical:)  [His bosom overflowed with
wrath, or rage], (A, TA.) And فَاضَ صَدْرُهُ
بِالسِّرِّ His bosom disclosed, or concealed, the secret;
(S, O, K;) his bosom could not conceal the secret;
(M;) his bosom was full with the secret, and disclosed it, not being able to conceal it. (TA.) ―
-b7-
And فَيْضٌ is used as meaning (assumed tropical:)  God's suggesting
(إِلْقَآء) [of a thing]: what the Devil suggests
(يُلْقِيهِ) is termed الوَسْوَسَةُ. (Kull p. 277.) ―
-b8-
فَاضَ البَعِيرُ بِجِرَّتِهِ: see 4, latter half.

افاض: see 1, first sentence.
-A2-  He filled a
vessel so that it overflowed: (S, M, O, K:) or
[simply] he filled a vessel, (M, Msb,) accord. to
Lh; but the former. [says ISd,] in my opinion,
is the correct signification. (M.) ―
-b2-  He made
water, and tears, and the like, to run, or flow;
or to pour out, or forth; or to pour out, or forth,
vehemently; to gush out, or forth: (M:) he poured
[water &c.] out, or forth: (A, TA:) or he poured
water out, or forth, copiously. (Mgh.) You say,
افاض المَآءَ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ, (S, O, K,) or على جَسَدِهِ,
(Msb,) He poured the water (S, O, Msb, K) upon
himself, (S, O, K,) or upon his body. (Msb.)
And افاض دُمُوعَهُ, (S,) or دَمْعَهُ, (Msb,) He poured
forth his tears. (Msb.) And افاضت العَيْنُ الدَّمْعَ
[The eye poured forth tears]. (TA.) ―
-b3-  افاض اللّٰهُ
الخَيْرَ (tropical:)  God made good, or wealth, &c., to abound.
(Msb.) ―
-b4-  افاض عَلَيْهِ الدِّرْعَ (tropical:)  He put on him the
coat of mail: like as you say صَبَّهَا [lit he poured
it]. (A, TA.) ―
-b5-  أَفَاضُوا مِنْ عَرَفَاتٍ (tropical:)  They pushed
on, pressed on, or went quickly, syn. دَفَعُوا, (S,
Mgh, O, Msb, K,) or اِنْدَفَعُوا, (M, A,) with multitude, (M, Mgh, O,) from 'Arafát, (S, M, A, Mgh,
O, Msb, K,) to Minè, (S, M, O,) exclaiming لَبَّيْكَ:
(M:) or they returned, and dispersed themselves
from 'Arafát: (O, K:) or they hastened from
'Arafát to another place: (K:) the last rendering
is taken from Ibn-'Arafeh; and agreeably with all
of these renderings, the phrase in the Kur [ii. 194],
فَإِذَا أَفَضْتُمْ مِنْ عَرَفَاتٍ, has been explained: (TA:)
and [in like manner,] you say افاضوا مِنَ مِنَى إِلَى
مَكِّةَ (tropical:)  They returned from Mine to Mekkeh; on
the day of the sacrifice: (Msb:) إِفَاضَةٌ signifies
(tropical:)  the advancing, and pushing on, or pressing on,
in journeying, or pace, (A, * TA,) and the like,
(A,) with multitude, and is only after a state of
separation and congregation: (TA:) it is from
the same word as signifying the “ pouring out, or
forth; ” (A, O, TA,) or from افاض المَآءَ signifying
“ he poured the water out, or forth, copiously ”
(Mgh:) and the original expression is افاض نَفْسَهُ.
or رَاحِلَتَهُ; but they omit the objective complement, and hence the verb resembles one that is
intrans.: (O, TA:) or افاضة signifies the quickly
impelling or urging [a beast] to run, with one's foot
or leg, or feet or legs: and افاض, he (a (??)) made
his camel to exert himself beyond measure, (??)
quick run, between the utmost (??) and what is (??)
than that; افاضة denoting the half [of the fall (??)
of the run of camels having riders upon these;
and being only applied when they have riders
upon them: (Khálid Ibn-Jembeh:) and every
دَفْعَة [or act of pushing on, or pressing (??),] is
termed إِفَاضَةٌ. (S, Msb, K.) Hence, طَوَافُ الإِفَاضَةِ,
signifying The (??) [around the K(??)
the return from Mine to Mekkeh; (Msb, TA)
on the day of the sacrifice: (TA:) or the circuiting of visitation. (Mgh.) ―
-b6-  افاضوا فِى الحَدِيثِ
(tropical:)  They pushed on, or pressed on, in discourse; syn.
اِنْدَفَعُوا: (Lh, S, M, A, O,) they entered thereinto; launched forth, or cut, thereinto: (Lh, M,
O;) they were large, or copious, or profuse, therein;
(O, TA:) or they dilated therein (M:) or they
began, commenced, or entered upon, discourse:
(Msb;) as also ↓ استفاضوهُ, (M, Msb,) accord. to
some; (Msb;) but this latter is disallowed by
most; (M;) or by the skilful, (Msb.) You say
also, افاض فِى عَمَلٍ (assumed tropical:)  He entered into an action,
or employment; and pushed on, or pressed on,
therein: (Bd in x. 62:) or he began it, commenced
it, or entered upon it. (Jel, ibid.) ―
-b7-  افاض بَالشَّيْءِ
He impelled, or thrust, with the thing: (M:) he
cast, or threw, the thing. (M, TA.) ―
-b8-  افاض البَعِيرُ

(S, O, K,) and بِجِرَّتِهِ ↓ فَاضَ, (TA,) (tropical:)  The camel
propelled his cud (Lh, S, M, A, K) from his inside,
(Lh, M, A,) or from his stomach, (S, K,) and
expelled it, or ejected it: (S:) or cast it forth in

made to be heard] the sound of his cud, and of
his chewing. (M.) ―
-b9-  مَا افاض بِكَلِمَةٍ (assumed tropical:)  He did not
make clear, or distinct, or perspicuous, a word, or
sentence. (Msb, TA.) [And ما افاض بكلمة signifies the same.] ―
-b10-  افاض بِالقِدَاحِ, (S, M, A, O,
K,) and عَلَى القِدَاحِ, meaning بِالقِدَاحِ, for prepositions stand in the places of other prepositions,
(S, O,) and افاض القِدَاحَ, (O, K,) (tropical:)  i. q. ضَرَبَ
بِالقِدَاحِ [which has two significations: He turned
about, or shuffled, the gaming-arrows: and he
played with the gaming-arrows]: (S, M, A, O,
K:) and أَجَالَهَا [which has the former of the above
significations]: or he dealt them forth. (TA.)
Aboo-Dhu-eyb says, describing a [wild] he-ass
and his she-asses,
فَكَأَنَّهُنَّ رِبَابَةٌ وَكَأَنَّهُ
يَسَرٌ يُفِيضُ عَلَى القِدَاحِ وَيَصْدَعُ
(S, TA) (tropical:)  [And it was as though they were a
bundle of gaming-arrows, and as though he were
a shuffler thereof, shuffling or] dealing out the arrows, and deciding, and making known what he
produced: (TA:) or, accord. to Kh, and speaking with his loudest voice, saying “ The arrow of
such a one has won,” or “ This is the arrow of
such a one: ” or, accord. to some, distributing, or
dispensing, by means of the arrows: (TA in art.
صدع:) by عَلَى القِدَاحِ is meant بِالقِدَاحِ. (S voce
عَلَى.) One relation of this verse substitutes
يَخُوضُ for يُفِيضُ. (TA.) Az says that إِفَاض [a
mistranscription for إِفَاضَةٌ] is always a consequence
of a state of separation, or dispersion, and abundance, or copiousness. (TA.) ―
-b11-  Hence the saying
in a trad. respecting a thing picked up from the
ground, ثُمَّ أَفِضْهَا مِنْ مَالِكَ, [app. a mistake for
فِى مَالِكَ,] i. e. (assumed tropical:)  Then put thou, or throw thou, it,
