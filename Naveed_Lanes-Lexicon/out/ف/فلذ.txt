as also ↓ فَلَذَ, inf. n. فَلْذٌ; (L, TA;) He cut in
pieces (T, O, L, K) flesh-meat. (T, L.) Hence,
in a trad., كَبِدَهُ ↓ إِنَّ الفَرَقَ مِنَ النَّارِ فَلَذَ [Verily
the fear of the fire of Hell cut in pieces his liver;
but perhaps فَلَذَ is here a mistranscription for

from fear of the fire [of Hell]. (L.)

TA.)

took, for himself, from him, a part, or portion,
of the property. (T.) And اِفْتَلَذْتُ مِنْهُ حَقِّى I

فِلْذٌ The liver of a camel: (S, M, O, L, K:)

M, O, L.)

K,) cut in an oblong from, (O,) and of flesh-meat,

T, M, L:) pl. [of mult.] فِلَذٌ (T, S, L, K) and
[of pauc.] أَفْلَاذٌ, (T, M, L, K,) the latter irregular,
as though the augmentative letter [in the sing.]
were elided; or فِلْذٌ may be a dial. var. of فِلْذَةٌ,
and so this pl. may be regular. (M, L.) ―
-b2-  أَفْلَاذُ
الأَرْضِ, (M, L, K,) or أَفْلَاذُ كَبِدِ الأَرْضِ, occurring
in a trad., (As, T, A, L,) relating to the signs of
the day of resurrection, accord. to different relations thereof, (L,) means (tropical:)  The buried treasures

-b3-  And أَفْلَاذُ كَبِدِ مَكَّةَ means (tropical:)  The principal and choicest persons of the inhabitants of
Mekkeh; of the tribe of Kureysh: so called
because the liver is one of the noble parts of the
body. (L.) ―
-b4-  الفِلَذَاتُ [(not to be mistaken for
الفِلِزَّاتُ) is a pl. of الفِلْذَةُ, and] signifies الأَجْسَامُ
السَّبْعَةُ [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  The seven material substances;
namely, the four elements, (fire, air, earth, and
water,) and the three products composed of these
(which are minerals, vegetables, and animals)].
(MF. [But in the copy of his work which I use,
الاجساد is erroneously put for الجسام.])
فَالُوذٌ (T, S, M, O, L, K) and ↓ فَالُوذَقٌ, but,
accord. to Yaakoob, not ↓ فَالُوذَجٌ, (S, O, L,) or
this is the proper form, because the ه in the
original Pers. word is regularly changed into ج,
(MF,) [the word being] arabicized, (T, S, O, L,)
from the Pers. (M, O, * L) بَالُودَه [or فَالُودَه or
پَالُودَه], (O,) A kind of sweet food, (M, O, * L, K,)
well known, (K,) prepared of the purest substance
of wheat (لُبّ الحِنْطَة), (T, L,) or of starch, (TA

[of which see an ex. in the next paragraph]. (A.)

i. e. purified and refined iron; or the pure part
of iron; (T, M, O, L, Msb, K;) which is added
in other iron: (M, L:) pl. فَوَالِيذُ. (A.) One
says, الضَّرْبُ بِالفَوَالِيذِ خَيْرٌ مِنَ الضَّرَْبِ فِى الفَوَالِيذِ
[The smiting with the weapons of steel in battle is
better than the thick white honey in the sweet
messes of the kind called فالوذ]. (A.)
فَالُوذَجٌ and فَالُوذَقٌ: see فَالُوذٌ, above.
مَفْلُوذٌ A sword made of فُولَاذ [i. e. steel].
(O, K.)
