فَجُرَ, (T, L, Msb,) inf. n. فَجْرٌ, (T,
Mgh, L, Msb,) He clave, [a thing]; cut, or

(Mgh.) He clave, or cut, a subterranean channel
for water. (Msb.) He broke open a dam of a
river or the like, that the water might break, burst,
or pour, through. (T, L.) ―
-b2-  And فَجَرَ المَآءَ, (S,
Mgh, O, Msb, K,) aor. and inf. n. as above; (S,
O;) and ↓ فجّرهُ, (S, O, K,) inf. n. تَفْجِيرٌ; (O, TA;)
but the latter is with teshdeed to denote muchness, or frequency, or repetition, of the action, or

You say, فَجَرَ الرَّاكِبُ, (K,) aor. as above, (TA,)
and so the inf. n., (K,) (tropical:)  The rider leant, or declined, from his saddle. (K.) ―

-b3-  And He erred
in answering, or replying. (El-Muärrij.) ―
-b4-  Hence
also, (S,) He lied; (S, O, Msb, K;) said of a

in this sense the former has also فَجْرٌ for an inf. n.,

The following passage of the Kur, بَلْ يُرِيدُ
الْإِنْسَانُ لِيَفْجُرَ أَمَامَهُ, [lxxv. 5], is said to mean,
[But man desireth, or nay, doth man desire,] to
disbelieve in that which is before him, [or that
which is to come,] namely, the resurrection and
reckoning and retribution: (O, TA:) or to continue in his فُجُور [i. e. vice, immorality, wickedness, unrighteousness, or the like,] in the time to

with, or accused him of, فُجُور [i. e. vice, immorality, unrighteousness, &c. (see 1)]; like فَسَّقَهُ:
whence the phrase, in a trad. of Ibn-Ez-Zubeyr,
فَجَّرْتَ بِنَفْسِكَ [Thou hast attributed to thyself, or
accused thyself of, unrighteousness, transgression,
or the like]. (TA.)

[hence, app.,] (assumed tropical:)  He made [his gift] large; syn.

-A2-  افجر as intrans.:
see 1, in four places.
-A3-  Also افجرهُ He found

K.)
-A4-  And افجر is like اصبح; (S, O;) signifying He entered upon the time of daybreak, or
dawn: (K, TA:) and he was near to entering
upon that time. (TA.) One says, كُنْتُ أَحُلُّ إِذَا
أَسْحَرْتُ وَأَرْحَلُ إِذَا أَفْجَرْتُ [I used to alight when
I entered upon the last sixth of the night, and
depart when I entered upon the time of daybreak].

5
تَفَجَّرَ see the next paragraph, in four places.
7
انفجر (S, O, Msb, K) and ↓ تفجّر, (S, O, K,)
but the latter is with teshdeed [as quasi-pass. of
2,] to denote muchness, or frequency, or repetition, or application to many subjects of the action,
(S, O, *) It (water) had a way, passage, vent, or
channel, opened for it to flow forth; it had vent;
(S, O, Msb;) it poured out, or forth, as though
impelled or propelled; syn. اِنْبَعَثَ; (TA;) it
flowed, ran, or streamed. (Msb, K.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,]
انفجر عَلَيْهِمُ العَدُوُّ (tropical:)  The enemy [poured upon

(L, A.) And انفجرت عَلَيْهِمُ الدَّوَاهِى (tropical:)  Calamities
[poured upon them;] came upon them from every
quarter, (K, * TA,) abundantly and suddenly.
(TA.) ―

بِهِ (assumed tropical:)  [He was profuse of generosity, or liberality]:
(K:) and فِى الخَيْرِ ↓ تفجّر (assumed tropical:)  [he was profuse in
bounty, or beneficence]. (S, O, TA.) ―
-b4-  And انفجر
الصُّبْحُ, and ↓ تفجّر, [The dawn broke forth]: and

it; namely, the rising dawn]. (K.)
8
افتجر فِى الكَلَامِ He forged speech, not having
heard it from any one, nor learned it. (O, K.)
فَجْرٌ [Daybreak; dawn;] the light of morning;
(Mgh, K;) because it is a cleaving of the darkness from before the light; (Mgh;) i. e., the redness of the sun in the darkness of night; (K;) the
فَجْر in the end of the night is like the شَفَق in the
beginning thereof: (S, O:) it is twofold: the
first is called الفَجْرُ الكَاذِبُ [the false dawn]; that
which rises without extending laterally, (المُسْتَطِيلُ,
Mgh, Msb,) which appears black, presenting itself
like an obstacle (مُعْتَرِضًا) [on the horizon]: (Msb:)
[see ذَنَبُ السِّرْحَانِ, in art. سرح:] the second is
called الفَجْرُ الصَّادِقُ [the true dawn]; which is the
rising and spreading [dawn], (المُسْتَطِيرُ, Mgh,
Msb,) which appears rising, and fills the horizon
with its whiteness; and this is what is called عَمُودُ
الصُّبْحِ; rising after the former has disappeared;
and by its rising the day commences, and everything by which fasting would be broken becomes
unlawful to the faster. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  Hence, The
time of the فَجْر. (Mgh.) ―
-b3-  And The prayer of
that time: the prefixed noun being suppressed.
(Mgh.) ―
-b4-  الفَجْرُ and البَحْرُ [in a saying mentioned voce بَحْرٌ, the former here written الفَجَرُ,
and said to be مُحَرَّكَة, but app. by mistake, for
it is afterwards written الفَجْرُ,] are metonymically
applied to (tropical:)  The troubles of the present state of
existence. (TA.)
فَجَرٌ (assumed tropical:)  Donation; (K;) generosity; (AO, S,
K;) bounty, or munificence; (K;) or large, or
ample, bounty or munificence; (AO, TA;) and
goodness, or beneficence. (K.) ―
-b2-  And Property.
(Kr, K.) And Much property. (O.) And Abundance of property. (K, TA.) Aboo-Mihjen EthThakafee says,
فَقَدْ أَجُودُ وَمَا مَالِى بِذِى فَجَرٍ
[And verily, or often, I practise liberality, or
bounty, while my property is not abundant].
(TA.)
فُجَرُ: see فَاجِرٌ, latter half.
فَجْرَةُ is a proper name, [i. e. an attributive
proper name,] imperfectly decl., like بَرَّةُ; [and
signifies the same as الفَجْرَةُ and فَجَارِ;] and
↓ فَجَارِ is altered from فَجْرَةٌ, (IJ, TA,) or from
الفَجْرَةُ, (Sb, TA,) and is a subst. in the sense of
الفُجُورُ [i. e. Vice, immorality, wickedness, unrighteousness, sin, or transgression, &c., (see 1,)]
(S,) or a name for الفَجْرَةُ [which signifies the
same], (O,) like قَطَامِ, (S, O,) determinate, (S,)
occurring in a verse of En-Nábighah cited in the
first paragraph of art. حمل. (S, O.) One says,
رَكِبَ فُلَانٌ فَجْرَةَ, (K, * TA, [in the CK فَجَرَةَ,])
and ↓ فَجَارِ, (TA,) Such a one lied; (K, TA;)
and acted vitiously &c. (فَجَرَ). (TA.) And حَلَفَ
فُلَانٌ عَلَى فَجْرَةَ, and اِشْتَمَلَ عَلَى فَجْرَةَ, [in the L
على فَجْرِهِ, in both instances, but the former is
the right reading,] Such a one commited a foul
deed, by swearing falsely, [relating to the former
phrase,] or by adultery, or fornication, or lying.
(TA.)
فُجْرَةٌ: see مَفْجَرٌ, in two places.

-A2-  أَيَّامُ الفِجَارِ is an appellation
applied to Four أَفْجِرَة; (K, TA;) the four أَفْجِرَة
meaning days [i. e. conflicts] of the Arabs; the
single day thereof being termed الفِجَارُ: (S, O,
TA:) they took place at 'Okádh; and those
engaged therein transgressed, and held to be
allowable everything that should be sacred; as
is said in the A: they were called فِجَارُ الرَّجُلِ
and فِجَارُ المَرْأَةِ and فِجَارُ القِرْدِ and فِجَارُ البَرَّاضِ;
the last, which was the greatest onslaught, being
thus called in relation to El-Barrád Ibn-Keys,
who slew 'Orweh Er-Rahhál: (TA:) they were
between Kureysh with their associates of Kináneh
on the one side and Keys-'Eylán on the other
side, (S, O, K,) in the Time of Ignorance; (S, O;)
and the [final] defeat befell Keys; it occurred in
the sacred months; and when they fought therein,
they said فَجَرْنَا; (S, O, K;) therefore Kureysh
called this war فِجَار; (S, O, TA; *) فِجَارٌ, like
مُفَاجَرَةٌ, being an inf. n. of فَاجَرَ, expl. above, on
the authority of the R. (TA.) ―

first paragraph]. (TA.) And one says يَمِينٌ
فَاجِرَةٌ meaning (tropical:)  A false oath: (Mgh in art. غمس:)
a tropical phrase. (Mgh in the present art.) ―
-b3-
فَاجِرٌ and ↓ فَجُورٌ, (K, TA,) the latter of which is
applied to a woman as well as to a man, (TA,)
and ↓ فَاجُورٌ, (K, TA,) which is mentioned by
Sgh, (TA,) are all epithets from فَجَرَ, and signify
[most frequently Acting vitiously, immorally, unrighteously, sinfully, or wickedly; or vitious, immoral, &c.; transgressing, or a transgressor;
quitting, or one who quits, the way of truth, or
justice; forsaking, or a forsaker of, the command

disobedience: [but the second and third are intensive epithets:] also committing adultery or
fornication; or an adulterer or a fornicator:
(K, TA:) and the first signifies also enchanting,
or an enchanter: (Sgh, K, TA:) the pl. of the
first is فُجَّارٌ and فَجَرَةٌ; and the pl. of the second
and third is فُجُرٌ. (K, TA.) ↓ فُجَرُ is altered
from فَاجِرٌ, for the sake of intensiveness, and is
[determinate, and] seldom used except in the
vocative form of speech: you say [in addressing
a number of men] يَا لَفُجَرَ [for يَا آلَ فُجَرَ, like as
you say يَا لَغُدَرَ for يَا آلَ غُدَرَ, q. v.; and meaning
O ye very vitious, &c.]; occurring in a trad. of
'Áïsheh. (TA.) And ↓ فَجَارِ, (K, TA,) like قَطَامِ,
(TA,) is a noun altered from الفَاجِرَةُ (K, TA) [or
from فَاجِرَةُ]: you say (S, O, K) to a woman (S,
O) يَا فَجَارِ (S, O, K) meaning يَا فَاجِرَةُ [O vitious
woman, &c.]. (S, O.)

مَفَاجِرُ الوَادِى signifies The parts, of the valley,
into which the torrent disperses itself: (S, O, TA:)
and الوَادِى ↓ فُجْرَةُ, (K, TA,) which would seem
to be with fet-h [to the ف] from its not being
restricted by the mention of any syll. signs, [and
is so in the CK,] but is correctly with damm,
(TA,) the wide part of the valley, into which the
water pours. (K, TA.) And مَفَاجِرُ الدِّبَارِ signifies The places opened for the flowing of the
