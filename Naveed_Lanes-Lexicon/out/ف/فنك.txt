O, K; *) as also ↓ افنك. (K.) [See also فَتَكَ;
and see other explanations below.] And فَنَكَ فِى
الكَذِبِ He persisted, or persevered, in lying: asserted by Yaakoob to be formed by transposition
from فَكَنَ: and Aboo-Tálib says that ↓ فانك and
↓ فنّك, of which latter the inf. n. is تَفْنِيكٌ, signify
he persisted, or persevered, in lying, and in evil;
not in good; and denote the like of consecutiveness. (TA.) [See also فَنْكٌ, which may be an
inf. n. of فَنَكَ in this sense, and in others.] And

K;) as also فَنِكَ, (S, O, K,) with kesr, (S, O,)
like عَلِمَ, (K,) inf. n. فُنُوكٌ; (S, O, K;) and so

وَالشَّرَابَ signifies [simply] I kept continually, or
constantly, to the food and the beverage: and also
I loathed them, or turned away from them with
disgust. (Ibn-'Abbád, O.) ―
-b4-  And فَنَكَ فِى الأَمْرِ
[not فانك as in the lexicons of Golius and Freytag,
the latter of whom gives both forms of the v. in
the sense here following, as does also the TK,]
signifies also He entered into the affair. (K.)
―
-b5-  And He mastered the affair, and overcame it.
(O.) ―
-b6-  فَنَكْتَ فِى لَوْمِى, and فيه ↓ افنكت, (both

فَنْكٌ i. q. عَجَبٌ: (IAar, O, K, TA:) [it app.
means A wonderful thing: for] IAar cites as an ex.,
وَلَا فَنْكَ إِلَّا سَعْىُ عَمْرٍو وَرَهْطِهِ
بِمَا اخْتَشَبُوا مِنْ مِعْضَدٍ وَدَدَانِ
[And there is not anything wonderful except the
conduct of 'Amr and his near kinsfolk in their
having taken without selection a sword commonly
used for lopping trees, and one that was blunt]:
(TA:) and ↓ فَنَكٌ signifies the same. (K, TA.)
-A2-  Also Persistence, or perseverence; or the act
of persisting, or persevering. (TA.) [In this and
the following senses, it seems to be an inf. n. of
which the verb is فَنَكَ; as is indicated in the TA.]
―
-b2-  And The act of overcoming. (O, K, TA.
[Accord. to the TA, from IAar; but said in the
O to be from another, not there named.]) ―
-b3-  And
The acting wrongfully, unjustly, injuriously, or
tyrannically. (IAar, O, K, TA.) ―
-b4-  And The
lying, or saying what is untrue. (IAar, O, K,
TA.)
فَنَكٌ A certain beast, (Kr, O, K,) of the skin of
which the furred garment is made; (Kr, S, O;)
[the marten;] the furred garment whereof is the
best sort of such garments, and the highest in estimation, and the most equable, and is suitable to
all temperate constitutions: (K:) it is said to be
a species of the Turkish fox's cubs; and therefore
Az and others say that the word is arabicized;
some of the travellers relate that it is applied to
the young-one of the jackal (اِبْن آوَى) in the
country of the Turks: (Msb:) it is also said to
mean a certain skin that is worn; and to be an
arabicized word: [in Pers. a furred garment is
called فَنَك:] IDrd says, “I do not think it to be
Arabic: ” and MF mentions ↓ فَنِيكٌ as signifying
an animal like the fox; an arabicized word; from
[a work entitled] غَايَة البَيَان; and he says that it
appears to be the فَنَك that is mentioned in the K.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  See also فَنْكٌ.
الفَنِيكُ The مَجْمَع [or part in which is the symphysis] of the لَحْيَانِ [or two lateral portions of
the lower jaw], (Lth, O, K, TA,) in the middle of
the chin, (Lth, O, TA,) of a man; (Lth, O, K,
TA;) this is when the word is used in the sing.
form; (Lth, O; [see also الفَكُّ;]) and it is also
called ↓ الإِفْنِيكُ; (Lth, O;) [and in like manner
Aboo-'Amr Esh-Sheybánee explained what is
meant by the upper فَنِيك as is stated by IF and
in the O:] or the extremity [of each] of the
لَحْيَانِ, at the place of the عَنْفَقَة [or tuft of hair
that is between the lower lip and the chin;] (S, K;)
also called ↓ الإِفْنِيكُ; but Ks knew not this: (S:)
or the فَنِيكَانِ are the two extremities of the عَنْفَقَة:
(O:) or (K, TA, in the CK “ and ”) the sing.
signifies a bone [beneath the temple,] to which the
shaving of the head reaches (عَظْمٌ يَنْتَهِى إِلَيْهِ حَلْقُ
الرَّأْسِ): (K, TA:) and accord. to Lth, the dual
signifies the two extremities of the [lower] jaw, of
whatever has a jaw, that move in the act of chewing, below the temples: (O:) or, accord. to Sh,
the two thin, rising bones, [app. the two coronoid
processes of the jaw,] lower than the ears, between
the temple and the ball of the cheek. (TA.) The
lower فَنِيك is [app. The symphysis of the pubes;
being] said by Aboo-'Amr Esh-Sheybánee to be
the part where the two hip-bones meet together:
(IF, O:) [hence, perhaps, and therefore it may
be erroneously,] the فنيك is said by AA to be the
root, or base, of the tail: (TA:) and it signifies,
as also ↓ الإِفْنِيكُ, (IDrd, O, K,) the زِمِكَّى, (K,)
or زِمِجَّى, [i. e. the place of growth, or the root,
or the whole, of the tail, of a bird, or] of a young
bird; as they assert; (IDrd, O;) but IDrd says,
“ I will not pronounce it to be correct: ” (O:)
and the dual signifies two bones cleaving together:
when, in the female pigeon, they are broken, she
does not retain her eggs [sufficiently], but excludes
them prematurely. (Lth, O.)
-A2-  See also فَنَكٌ.
الإِفْنِيكُ: see the next preceding paragraph, in
three places.
مُتَفَنِّكَةٌ A foolish, or stupid, woman. (Ibn-
'Abbád, O, K.)
