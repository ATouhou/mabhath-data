O, K.)
-A3-  And Places in which water collects and
remains: and a depressed piece of ground into

as is not very deep. (O.)

and ↓ فَشْفَاشٌ, [this last said in the TA to be
written by Sgh with kesr, but it is not so in the
O,] A [garment of the kind called] كِسَآء such as
is thick (IAar, O, K, TA) in texture, (TA,) fine

which may be a secondary meaning, but is not
the meaning in what here follows]. (O, K.) فَشَاشِ

woman from whom wind issues on the occasion of
الجِمَاع: (IDrd, O, K, TA:) or, accord. to the
K, applied to a woman, sonum submissum genitalibus edens in congressu: and also, applied to a
man, who glories, or boasts, vainly: but these two
explanations are there wrongly assigned: (TA:)
the former of them applies to نَجَّاخَة; and the
latter, to فَيُوش; two epithets occurring, with
فَشُوش, in a verse of Ru-beh. (O, TA.) ―
-b2-  And,
applied to a woman, i. q. خَلَّابَةٌ [i. e. Very deceitful]: (O, CK, TA:) thus correctly, with خ: in

جُرْدَان. (TA.)
-A2-  Also, (O, K,) applied to a
she-camel, (S, O, TA,) and to a ewe, or she-goat,
(O, TA,) it signifies مُنْتَشِرَةُ الشُّخْبِ, (S, O, K,
TA,) meaning Whose milk flows forth without its
being drawn, by reason of the wideness of the orifice of the teat: or whose milk flows forth in
separate jets, like the rays of the rising sun, into
the vessel, so as not to make froth: and ↓ فِشَاشٌ
signifies the quality, or state, that is denoted by
this epithet thus applied. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And A skin,
such as is used for water or milk, that sweats, or
exudes moisture. (O, K.)

three places.
