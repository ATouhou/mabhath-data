فرض1
فَرَضَهُ, (S, A, O, Msb, &c.,) aor.
فَرِضَ, (Msb,
TA, &c.,) inf. n. فَرْضٌ, (S, O, Msb, K, &c.,) He
made a mark in it, or upon it, by notching, or
otherwise: (O:) he notched it: made a notch, or
an incision, in it; (S, O, Msb, K;) namely, a
piece of wood, (Msb,) a زَنْد, [or rather فَرَضَهَا
said of a زَنْدَة, from which fire is produced,] and
a سِوَاك [or toothstick], (S, O,) and in like manner
a bow; (A;) as also [↓ افترضهُ; (see this verb
below;) and] ↓ فرّضهُ, inf. n. تَفْرِيضٌ: (K:) or
this last signifies he notched it much; or made
notches in it; (S, O, TA;) or you say, فَرَضَ قَوْسَهُ
and فَرَّضَ قِسِيَّهُ: (A:) and فَرَضَهُ signifies he notched
it with his teeth; namely, a tooth-stick: (As:) and
he cut it; namely, a thing; or a hard thing;
which is said by some to be the primary signification: (TA:) and he (a tailor) cut it out;
namely a garment: (Kull p. 275:) and he cut it
out and made it round; namely a shield: (TA:)
and فَرْضٌ also signifies the cutting, or dividing,
lengthwise; cleaving; or the like; applied in a
general manner; or the making a trench, or an
oblong excavation, in the middle of a grave;
فَرَضْتُ لِلْمَيِّتِ signifying I made a trench, or an
oblong excavation, in the middle of a grave, for
the corpse. (TA.)
-A2-  فَرَضَ لَهُ, [aor. and] inf. n.
as above, (K, &c.,) He apportioned to him [a
thing]: he appointed to him [a thing]: (Bd in
xxxiii. 38, and TA: *) because that which is
apportioned, or appointed, [to a person] is cut
off from the thing from which it is apportioned,
or appointed: (TA:) he made [a thing] lawful,
or allowable, to him; (Jel in xxxiii. 38, and
Kull in p. 275, and TA; *) relating to a case into
which a man has brought himself: (Kull:) this
is said to be the meaning when the phrase فَرَضَ
اللّٰهُ لَهُ occurs in the Kur: (TA:) he appointed,
or assigned, to him a definite portion; (K;) as
also له ↓ افرض. (O, L, K.) You say فَرَضَ لَهُ فِى
العَطَآءِ [He appointed, or assigned, to him a definite portion in the gift]. (As, S.) And فَرَضَ
لَهُ فِى الدِّيوَانِ (As, S, A) [He appointed, or
assigned, to him a definite portion in the register
of soldiers or pensioners; or] he registered his
stipend therein. (As, A, TA.) And فَرَضَهُ, (S,)
and ↓ افرضهُ, (S, K,) He gave to him. (S, O, K.)
―
-b2-  فَرَضَ, (S, A, Mgh, Msb,) aor. as above, (TA,)
and so the inf. n., (Msb, TA,) also signifies He
(God, S, A, Mgh, Msb) made a thing, (S, TA,)
or prayer, (A, Mgh,) or statutes or ordinances,
(Msb,) obligatory, or binding, syn. أَوْجَبَ, (S, A,
Mgh, Msb, TA,) by a known decree, (TA,) [or
He imposed a thing &c.,] عَلَى إِنْسَانٍ on a man,
(TA,) or عَلَيْنَا on us; (S;) and so ↓ اِفْتَرَضَ: (S,
A, Mgh, O, K:) or فَرْضٌ is like إِيجَابٌ; but the
latter is so termed in consideration of its befalling; and the former is so called in consideration
of the sentence, or decree, respecting it: (B:)
[this is said in books on the law, in explanation
of the opinion of Aboo-Haneefeh, as opposed to
that of Esh-Sháfi'ee: for] accord. to Esh-Sháfi'ee,
these two terms are alike; (L, TA;) but accord.
to Aboo-Haneefeh, the difference between الوَاجِبُ
and الفَرْضُ is like the difference between heaven
and earth: (TA:) this distinction, however, is
founded upon contested derivations of the two
terms: (Kull p. 276:) and it is said that wherever
the phrase فَرَضَ اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ occurs, it means إِيجَابٌ.
(TA.) Also He (the apostle of God) instituted,
or prescribed, [a thing as a statute, or an ordinance, or a command or prohibition;] syn. سَنَّ;
(O, K;) on the authority of IAar alone: (O,
TA:) but accord. to others, he made necessarily
obligatory or binding; and this, says Az, is the
obvious meaning. (TA.) Also He (a judge)
decreed, or adjudged, [TA.) Also He (a judge)
decreed, or adjudged, [a thing, as, for instance,]
expenses [&c.]. (Msb.) Also He assigned, or
appointed, a particular time for doing a thing;
or he determined, defined, or limited, a thing as
to time, or otherwise; the inf. n., فَرْضٌ, being syn.
with تَوْقِيتٌ: (Ibn-'Arafeh, A, O, K:) as in the
phrase فَمَنْ فَرَضَ فِيهِنَّ الحَجَّ [And whoso determineth the performance of the pilgrimage therein];
(Ibn-'Arafeh, O, K;) occurring in the Kur [ii.
193]; and in like manner it is expl. by Ibn-
'Arafeh as occurring in xxxiii. 38 of the Kur
(O, TA:) but the phrase quoted above is also
expl. as meaning and whoso maketh it obligatory,
or binding, on himself to perform the pilgrimage
therein, by his entering upon the state of إِحْرَام.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  سُورَةٌ أَنْزَلْنَاهَا وَفَرَضْنَاهَا, (K,) in the Kur,
[commencing chap. xxiv.,] (TA,) means [This is
a chapter which we have revealed and] in which
we have set down the obligatory statutes: (O, K:)
or in which we have bound you to do according to
what is made obligatory therein: (Az, O:) or, as
some read, ↓ وَفَرَّضْنَاهَا, (S, O, K, *) meaning and
in which we have set down obligatory statutes, (O,
L, K,) one after another: (O, K:) or which we
have distinctly explained: (Az, S, O, K:) or we
have distinctly explained what is in it, of lawful

-b4-  فَرْضٌ also

He was, or became, skilled in the فَرَائِض; (A, O,
K, TA;) i. e. in the science of the division of inheritances. (TA.) MF says that, accord. to IKtt,
the verb is also written فَرَضَ, like كَتَبَ: but
[says SM] what I find in his “ Kitáb el-Abniyeh ”
is the mention of the two modes of writing in the
instance of فرضت said of a cow; and the verb
applied to a man he has not mentioned. (TA.)
-A4-  فَرَضَتْ, aor.
فَرِضَ, inf. n. فُرُوضٌ; and فَرُضَتْ, inf. n.

the first half of the paragraph.
-A2-  أَفْرَضَتِ المَاشِيَةُ
The beasts amounted to the number which rendered
it obligatory on the owner to give from among
them a فَرِيضَة. (S, O, K. *)

افترضهُ: see 1, first sentence. ―
-b2-  لَمْ يَفْتَرِضْهَا
وَلَدٌ, occurring in a trad., means [A child had not

stipends. (A, K.)

فَرْضٌ A mark [made by notching, or otherwise;
as is shown by the first explanation of 1]: (TA:)
a notch, or an incision, in a thing: (O, TA:) of
a bow, (S, A, K,) the place of the string; (K;)
the notch (S, A, O) in the curved extremity
thereof, (A,) into which the string falls; (S, O;)
as also ↓ فُرْضَةٌ; (A, TA;) or this is the place of
the notch for the string thereof: (Msb:) pl. of
the former فِرَاضٌ (S, O, K) and فُرُوضٌ; (TA;)
and of the latter فُرَضٌ (Msb, TA) and فِرَاضٌ:
(Msb:) also, of a زَنْد, (S, K,) or [rather] of a زَنْدَة,
(A,) the notch; (K;) or the place, or part, whence
the fire is produced; (S, K;) the hole, or perforation, that is made in the head thereof, into which
the زَنْد is put, and then twisted round, in producing fire; also called وَكْرٌ; (A;) and ↓ فُرْضَةٌ
signifies the same: (TA:) and فُرَضٌ also signifies notches in an unfeathered and headless
arrow [such as is used in the game called المَيْسِر].
(TA.)
-A2-  I. q. ↓ مَفْرُوضٌ (A, Msb, K) [Apportioned: appointed; made lawful, or allowable:
and] a thing made obligatory, or binding, by
God; (S, A, O, K;) for neglecting which one
will be punished; like وَاجِبٌ; accord. to EshSháfi'ee; (TA in art. وجب;) because it has
marks and limits; (S, O, TA;) said to be from
the same word signifying “ a mark,” because it
inseparably pertains to a man, like a mark;
(TA;) or, as some say, because it necessarily
pertains to a man like as does the فَرْض, i. e.
notch, to the arrow; (O, TA;) as also ↓ مُفْتَرَضٌ:
(TA:) pl. فُرُوضٌ. (Msb.) As a law-term, it is
of two sorts, فَرْضُ عَيْنٍ and فَرْضُ كِفَايَةٍ: the
former is That whereof the observance is obligatory
on every one, and does not become of no force in
respect of some in consequence of the observance
[thereof] by some [others]; as religious belief,
and the like: the latter is That whereof the observance is obligatory on the collective body of the
Muslims, and, in consequence of the observance
[thereof] by some, becomes of no force in respect
of the rest; as warring against unbelievers, and
the prayer over the dead in the bier. (KT.) You
say, هٰذَا أَمْرٌ فَرْضٌ عَلَيْهِمْ, and ↓ مَفْرُوضٌ, and
↓ مُفْتَرَضٌ, This is [a thing] made obligatory, or
binding, on them by God. (TA.) And حَقُّكَ
فَرْضٌ, and ↓ مَفْرُوضٌ, and ↓ مُفْتَرَضٌ, Thy right, or
due, is [a thing] made obligatory, or binding, by
God. (A.) ↓ نَصِيبًا مَفْرُوضًا, in the Kur [iv. 8
and 118], means A share, or portion, determined,
defined, or limited, as to time, or otherwise: (Zj,
Ibn-'Arafeh:) or, in iv. 118, a share, or portion,
cut off and limited. (S, O.) [See also فَرِيضَةٌ.]
―
-b2-  A statute, an ordinance, a command or prohibition, of the Apostle of God; syn. سُنَّةٌ. (IAar,
O, K.) [But فَرْضٌ is generally distinguished from
سُنَّةٌ: the former, for instance, being applied to
prayer appointed in the Kur-án; and the latter,
to prayer appointed by Mohammad without allegation of a divine order.] ―
-b3-  A gift, or a soldier's
stipend or pay, syn. عَطَآءٌ, (A,) or عَطِيَّةٌ, (S, O, K,)
assigned, or appointed. (S, O, K. *) In the copies
of the K, مَوْسُومَة is put by mistake for مَرْسُومَة.
(TA.) You say, مَا أَصَبْتُ مِنْهُ فَرْضًا وَلَا قَرْضًا I did
not obtain from him an assigned, or appointed,
gift, or soldier's stipend, (S, O, TA,) nor a gift
to be requited, or a loan. (O, TA.) And فَرْضٌ
also signifies A thing which one makes obligatory,
or binding, on himself, and freely gives: or a thing
which one gives liberally, not for a recompense.
(IDrd, O, K.)
-A3-  Also Soldiers who receive stipends; (K:) so accord. to Lth, as related by Az;
but [Sgh says] I have not found it in the book
of Lth: (O:) or soldiers having definite portions
assigned to them: (A:) pl. فُرُوضٌ. (A, TA.) You
say, عِنْدَهُ مِائَةٌ مِنَ الفَرْضِ He has with him a
hundred soldiers &c. (A.)
-A4-  A shield. (S, O,
K.) Sakhr-el-Gheí says, describing lightning,
(O, TA,) likening it to a light shield which an
announcer of tidings was turning over and over
with his hands that a party might see it and be
gladdened [by the signal], (TA,)
أَرِقْتُ لَهُ مِثْلَ لَمْعِ البَشِيرِ
يُقَلِّبُ بِالكَفِّ فَرْضًا خَفِيفًا
[I was sleepless by reason of it, it being (in its
flickering) like the signalling of the announcer of
tidings turning over and over with the hand a
light shield]: one should not say قُرْصًا خفيفا. (S,
O, TA: but my copies of the S have قَلَّبَ instead
of يُقَلِّبُ.) [See also what follows.] ―
-b2-  And A
stick, or piece of wood; syn. عُودٌ; thus [it means]
in the verse (فِى البَيْتِ) accord. to El-Jumahee,
(O, TA,) i. e. in the verse above-cited: (TA:)
he says, الفَرْضُ فِى البَيْتِ عُودٌ: (O, TA:) whence
the author of the K has been misled to explain
الفَرْضُ as meaning عُودٌ مِنْ أَعْوَادِ البَيْتِ. (TA.)
―
-b3-  And An arrow before it has been furnished
with feathers and a head: (Akh, S, O, TA:) a
meaning also heard by El-Jumahee: (O, TA:)
and to this, in the hand of the player, 'Abeed ElAbras has likened lightning, accord. to the S;
but Sgh says, in the TS, that he did not find the
verse cited by J in the poetry of 'Abeed. (TA.)
―
-b4-  And A piece of rag: another explanation
heard by El-Jumahee. (O.) ―
-b5-  And A garment,
or piece of cloth: (O, K:) a meaning mentioned
by As on the authority of some one or more of
the Arabs of the desert, of Hudheyl. (O.) [See
also فِرَاضٌ.] ―
-b6-  And it is said that in the verse
cited above it means the notch in the زَنْد [or
rather زَنْدَة, mentioned in the first sentence of
this paragraph]. (O, TA.)
-A5-  A sort of dates
(S, O, Msb, K) of 'Omán: (Msb:) As says that
the best dates of 'Omán are these and the بَلْعَق:
(S, O:) and AHn says, Certain of the desertArabs of 'Omán informed me that when the tree
thereof has its fruit ripened, and the gathering is
delayed, the fruit falls from its stones, and the
raceme remains with nothing upon it but stones
hanging to the ثَفَارِيق [by which they are attached
to the ends of the stalks]. (TA.)
فِرْضٌ The fruit of the دَوْم [or Theban palm]

the ships, or boats, ascend; (Msb;) i. e. (Mgh)
its مَشْرَعَة: (As, A, Mgh:) pl., in this and the
following senses, فُرَضٌ (TA) and فِرَاضٌ. (A, TA.)
Hence the saying, in a trad., فَاجْعَلُوا السُّيُوفَ
لِلْمَنَايَا فُرَضًا (assumed tropical:)  Therefore make ye the swords to be
مَشَارِع [here used in the sense of means of access]
to death; (O, TA;) and offer, or expose, yourselves to martyrdom. (TA.) Hence also, فِرَاضٌ
is used in the sense of ثُغُورٌ [pl. of ثَغْرٌ, q. v.].

measure مَفْعُولَةٌ: pl. فَرَائِضُ: said by some to be
derived from فَرْضٌ signifying the act of “ apportioning,” or “ appointing; ” because فرائض are
