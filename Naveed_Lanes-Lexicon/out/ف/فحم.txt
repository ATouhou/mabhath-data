called فَحْمَةُ العِشَآءِ [q. v.]: like أَعْتَمَ. (TA.) ―

-A2-  افحمهُ is said of weeping [as
meaning It stopped his voice, or his breath]: (TA:)
see 1. And He silenced him, (S, Msb, TA,)

meaning is We contended with you in satirizing
and found you not to be مُفْحَمُون]): or, accord.
to IB, this means, and we caused you not to hold
the tongue from answering, or replying; because
المُهَاجَاةُ is between two persons: but you [may]
say هَجَوْتُهُ فَأَفْحَمْتُهُ meaning [I satirized him]
and I found him to be مُفْحَم. (TA.)

إِفْتَحَمَ [الاِفْتِحَامُ is expl. in some copies of the K as
signifying الاِغْتِبَاقُ; in some, الاِعْتِنَاقُ; and app.
in the copy used by Golius, الاِعْتِيَاقُ: the first,
which is that followed in the TK, is evidently, I
think, the right; meaning The drinking an evening draught; such as is termed a غَبُوق. See also
the next paragraph, second and last sentences.]
فَحْمٌ and ↓ فَحَمٌ, (S, Msb, K,) the latter sometimes occurring, (S, Msb,) like نَهْرٌ and نَهَرٌ, (S,)

of مَعْزٌ, &c.: (TA:) the n. un. [meaning a piece
of charcoal] is ↓ فَحْمَةٌ, (S, K, TA,) but not فَحَمَةٌ.

-A2-  And فَحْمٌ signifies also The draught
that is drunk in [any one of] the times denoted
by the word فَحْمَةٌ [q. v.]: (K, TA:) like the غَبُوق

it is an inf. n. of which the verb is ↓ فَحَمَ, aor.

the blackness of the night, and its darkness; which
is in its first part: or the time next after the عشاء:
(TA:) the pl. is فِحَامٌ and فُحُومٌ: (K, TA:) or
the latter of these may mean darkness; as though
it were an inf. n. of فَحُمَ. (TA.) فَحْمَةُ السَّحَرِ

night]. (K.) And فَحْمَةُ بْنُ جُمَيْرٍ is [a proper
