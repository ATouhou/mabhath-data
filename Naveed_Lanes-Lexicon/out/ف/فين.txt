فين1
فَانَ, aor. يَفِينُ, (K,) inf. n. فَيْنٌ, (TA,) He,
or it, came. (K.)
فَيْنَةٌ A time; syn. وَقْتٌ, or وَقْتٌ مِنَ الزَّمَانِ;
(T;) or حِينٌ; (T, S, M, K;) and سَاعَةٌ. (S,
K.) You say, لَقِيتُهُ الفَيْنَةَ بَعْدَ الفَيْنَةِ [I met him
time after time]: (AZ, S, M, K; but some copies
of the K omit the words بعد الفينة:) and لَقِيتُهُ فَيْنَةَ
[I met him at a certain time]: (AZ, S, M, K;
but in some copies of the S and K, فَيْنَةً:) thus
فينة is made determinate in two different ways;
by its having the article ال prefixed to it [in the
former case], and as a proper name [in the latter
case; with which compare what is said of بُكْرَةَ
&c.]: (AZ, M:) and you say, إِنِّى لَآتِى فُلَانًا
الفَيْنَةَ بَعْدَ الفَيْنَةِ i. e. [Verily I come to such a one]
time after time; not continually repairing to him:
(AZ, T:) and, accord. to ISk, مَا أَلْقَاهُ إِلَّا الفَيْنَةَ
i. e. [I do not meet him save occasionally, or] time
after time. (TA.) [See also فَنَّةٌ.]
فَيْنَان Having beautiful and long hair: (K:)
or so فَيْنَانُ الشَّعَرِ; applied to a man: (S:) فَيْنَان
[is also applied as an epithet to hair; and] has
been mentioned in art. فن q. v.: (K:) if it be
from فَنَنٌ, meaning “ a branch,” it is [of the
measure فَيْعَالٌ, and therefore] perfectly decl. when
indeterminate, and likewise when determinate [as
a proper name]; but if from فَيْنَةٌ, meaning “ a
time,” [which seems to be hardly reasonable,] it
is [of the measure فَعْلَان, and therefore] perfectly
decl. in the former case and imperfectly decl. in
the latter case. (Lh, T.) ―
-b2-  One says also ظِلٌّ
فَيْنَانٌ, meaning Wide, extensive, shade. (TA.)
أَفْيُونٌ, also written أُفْيُونٌ and إِفْيَوْنٌ, held by
some to belong to this art. and by others to
belong to art. افن, has been mentioned in
page 70.
