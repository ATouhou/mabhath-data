فح1
فَحَّتِ الأَفْعَى, aor.
فَحُ3َ and
فَحِ3َ, (S, K,) the
former dev. from a general rule, which requires
the aor. of a verb of this class when intrans. to
be with kesr only, (S,) inf. n. فَحِيحٌ (S, K) and
فَحٌّ and تَفْحَاحٌ, (K,) [the last an intensive form,]
The viper [hissed, or] made a sound to proceed
from its mouth: (S, K, TA: [see a verse cited
voce مِطْحَانٌ:]) or what is meant by this verb is
[it made a sound by] the rubbing of one part of
its skin against another part: or (TA) its making
a sound to proceed from its skin is termed كَشِيشٌ,
(S, TA,) or خَفِيفٌ: (As, TA:) some use this
verb (فحّت) in relation to any serpent: others,
peculiarly in relation to the female of the [serpents called] أَسَاوِد. (TA.) [J gives here a list of
intrans. verbs of this class which have the aor. with
damm, anomalously, and also with kesr; and a
list of trans. verbs of the same class which have the
aor. with kesr, anomalously, and also with damm:
but both lists are defective; and it would be difficult to make them complete.] ―
