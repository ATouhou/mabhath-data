فَعُمَ, inf. n. فَعَامَةٌ and فُعُومَةٌ, It was,

فَعَّمَ see what next follows.
4
افعم; [like أَفْأَمَ;] (S, K;) and so افغم;
(K in art. فغم;) as also ↓ فعّم; (thus in some of
the copies of the K;) or ↓ فَعَمَ, (thus accord. to
other copies of the K and accord. to the TA,)
aor.
فَعَمَ, inf. n. فَعْمٌ; (TA;) He filled a vessel;
(S, K, TA;) and exceeded the usual degree, or
strove, or laboured, or did not fall short of what
was requisite, in filling it. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And أَفْعَمْتُ
البَيْتَ بِرِيحِ العُودِ [I filled the house, or chamber,
or tent, with the odour of aloes-wood]. (S.) It is
said in a trad., لَوْ أَنْ امْرَأَةً مِنَ الحُورِ العِينَ أَشْرَفَتْ
لَأَفْعَمَتْ مَا َبيْنَ السَّمَآءِ وَالأَرْضِ رِيحَ المِسْكِ i. e. [If
a woman (or Paradise) of those having eyes like
the eyes of gazelles rose into view,] she would fill
[the space between the heaven and the earth with
the odour of musk]: thus related: and also
لَأَفْغَمَتْ, and لَفَغَمَتْ: but Az says that the right
relation is لافعمت, with ع. (TA in this art. and
in art. فغم.) And one says, افعم المِسْكُ البَيْتَ
The musk filled with its odour, (S,) or perfumed,
(K,) [the house, or chamber, or tent.] ―
-b3-  And
افعم الرَّجُلَ He filled the man with anger; (S,
TA;) mentioned by Az on the authority of Aboo-Turáb: (TA:) or he angered him: or he filled his
nose with odour, (K, TA,) i. e. with sweet odour:
(TA:) as also ↓ فَعِمَهُ and ↓ فَعَمَهُ, aor. of both
فَعَمَ,
(K, TA,) inf. n. فَعْمٌ; but better known with the
pointed غ. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And افعمهُ and افغمهُ He
filled him with joy, or happiness. (Aboo-Turáb,
TA.)
12
اِفْعَوْعَمَ It became full, and overflowed.
(K.) ―
-b2-  And افعوعم طِيبًا It (a house, or chamber,
or tent,) became filled with perfume. (TA.)
فَعْمٌ Full; applied in this sense to a سَاعِد [or
fore arm]; (S, K;) and to a vessel; as also
↓ فَعْمَلٌ, in which the ل is augmentative: (K:)
and full of flesh; applied to the place of the
anklet. (TA.) It is said of the Prophet, in a
trad., كَانَ فَعْمَ الأَوْصَال i. e. He was full in
respect of the limbs. (TA.) And one says اِمْرَأَةٌ
فَعْمَةٌ A woman full-formed, and thick in her
shank. (K.) And حَاضِرٌ فَعْمٌ A [great] tribe
filled with its people. (TA.) [See also مُفْعَمٌ:
and see أَفْعَمُ.]
-A2-  And A species of tree: or the
rose. (K.)
فَعْمَلٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
أَفْعَمُ Full [like فَعْمٌ]: or overflowing by reason
of fulness. (TA.)
مُفْعَمٌ Filled; applied in this sense to a skin
for water or milk; as also مُفْأَمٌ: but as to ↓ مَفْعُومٌ,
IAar asserts that he had not heard it except in a
verse of Kutheiyir: Az, however, mentions it as
signifying full [like فَعْمٌ], applied to a river, or
rivulet: and Aboo-Sahl cites an ex. of it from
the verses of the Fs as signifying full of flesh.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  The phrase سَيْلٌ مُفْعَمٌ may be of the
same category as هَمٌّ نَاصِبٌ [for هَمٌّ ذُو نَصَبٍ], the
meaning being A torrent having the quality of
filling; though the possessive epithet in most
instances has the form of the act. part. n., such
as طَالِقٌ [for ذَاتَ طَلَاقٍ] and مُرْضِعٌ [for ذَاتُ رَضِيعٍ]:
or it may be that مَفْعَمٌ in this case is expressive
of muchness, or abundance, like the latter word
in the phrase شِعْرٌ شَاعِرٌ and in مَوْتٌ مَائِتٌ. (Ham
p. 106.)
مَفْعُومٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.

in the evilness of his disposition. (TA.)

-b2-  And [the fem.] فَاعِيَةٌ A woman (TA)
wont to calumniate; syn. نَمَّامَةٌ. (K, TA: in the

Lawsonia inermis, or Egyptian privet]: (K:)
[said to be] a dial. var. of فَاغِيَةٌ [q. v.]. (TA.)
أَفْعًى, (S, Msb, K) of the fem. gender, but with
tenween, (S, Msb,) because it is a subst., not an
epithet; (Msb;) [said in the S and Msb to be
like أَرْوًى; but this is a mistake, for اروى is without tenween;] or it is an epithet and a subst.;
(K, TA;) but mostly a subst.; (TA;) [if used
as an epithet, it is without tenween, written أَفْعَى,
being also of the measure of a verb;] A certain
serpent, (S, Msb, K,) of a malignant kind; [i. e.
the viper;] also called ↓ أُفْعُوٌّ, (K, TA, [in the
CK, erroneously, اُفْعُوان, which see in what
follows,]) occurring in a trad., in which it is said
that there is no harm in the killing of the أُفْعُوّ
and the حُدُوّ by the مُحْرِم, the [final] alif being
changed into و in both of these words in the dial.
of El-Hijáz: (TA:) it is spotted, black and white;
slender in the neck; broad in the head; it is said
that it will not quit its place; (TA;) always coiling itself round; and neither antidote nor charm
is of any avail against it: (Msb, TA:) sometimes it has two horns [i. e. it sometimes signifies
the cerastes, or horned viper]: (TA:) ↓ أُفْفُوَانٌ
signifies the male: (S, Msb, TA:) [see also
خِشَاشٌ:] the pl. is أَفَاعٍ. (S, Msb, K. * [In the
K, the pl. is written أَفَاعِى, which, when indeterminate, is wrong.]) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] by way of comparison [to vipers], (TA,) الأَفَاعِى signifies (tropical:)  Certain veins (عُرُوق) that branch off from the حَالِبَانِ
[q. v.]. (K.)
أَفْعآءٌ [a pl. of which the sing. is not mentioned]
