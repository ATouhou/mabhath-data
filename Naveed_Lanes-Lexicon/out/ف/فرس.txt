فرس1
فَرَسَهُ, aor.
فَرِسَ, inf. n. فَرْسٌ, (S, M, O, Msb, K,
&c.,) He (a lion) broke, or crushed so as to break,
its neck; (S, A, * Mgh, * O, K;) i. e., the neck of
his فَرِيسَة; (S, O, K;) as also ↓ افترسهُ: (S:) this
is the primary signification: (S, Mgh, TA:) or
he (a beast of prey) seized it, (a thing,) and broke,
or crushed so as to break, its neck; as also ↓ افترسهُ:
(M:) or he (a lion) broke it; i. e., his فَرِيسَة:
(Msb:) and he bruised, or crushed, and broke, it;
namely, a thing. (M.) Accord. to ISk, (S,) you
say, فَرَس الذِئْبُ الشَّاةَ, (S, TA,) meaning The wolf
seized the sheep, or goat, and broke, or crushed so
as to break, its neck: (TA:) accord. to En-Nadr
(i. e. ISh), you say, أَكَلَ الذِّئْبُ الشَّاةَ [The wolf
ate, or devoured, the sheep, or goat], but not
↓ افترسها. (S, O, TA.) ―
-b2-  Hence, (S, Mgh, O,
Msb,) He killed it, in any manner; (S, Mgh, O,
Msb, K;) as also ↓ افترسهُ: (TA:) or ↓ the latter,
he (a lion, O, or a wolf, TA) captured it; or
made it his prey. (O, K, TA. See also 2 [where
a similar but tropical usage of the former verb is
mentioned.]) You say, فَرَسَهُ الأَسَدُ The lion killed
him or it. (Mgh.) ―
-b3-  فَرَسَ الذَّبِيحَةَ, (M, Msb,)
aor.
فَرِسَ, (M,) inf. n. as above, (S, M, Mgh,) He
(the slaughterer) broke the bone of the neck of the
slaughtered animal before it became cold: (S,
Mgh, O:) or broke its neck before its death:
(Msb:) or cut, or severed, its نُخَاع [or spinal
cord]: or divided its neck: (M, TA:) or slaughtered it so as to reach to the نخاع: (AO, TA:)
the action thus [variously] expl. is forbidden. (S,
Mgh, Msb, TA.) ―
-b4-  قَبِيحَةً ↓ فَرَسَهُ فِرْسَةً He struck
him [in an abominable manner, app. in the back,]
so that the part between his hips became depressed
and his navel protruded. (M.)
-A2-  فَرُسَ, aor.
فَرُسَ,
(S, A, O, K,) inf. n. فُرُوسَةٌ (S, A, O, K *) and
فَرَاسَةٌ (S, K, * in the O فِرَاسَةٌ) and فُرُوسِيَّةٌ, (S, * A,
O, * K, *) all of which ns. are mentioned as syn.
by As, (TA,) [as they are also in the S and K,]
and the first and last, in like manner, by IAar,
(TA,) [but the first is expressly said to be an
inf. n. of فَرُسَ in the S and A only, and the
second in the S only, and the third (which seems
to be rather a simple subst.) in the A only,] He
was, or became, skilled in horsemanship, or in the
management of horses, (S, A, O, K, TA,) and in
riding them, (O, * K, TA,) and in urging them to
run, and in remaining firm upon them: (TA:)
or فَرَاسَةٌ and فُرُوسَةٌ are inf. ns. having no verb:
Lh only [says ISd] mentions فَرَسَ and فَرُسَ as
signifying he became a horseman; and this is
extr.: (M, TA:) but [beside what has been cited
above, from the S and A and K,] IKtt also says
that فَرَسَ الخَيْلَ, inf. n. فُرُوسَةٌ and فُرُوسِيَّةٌ, signifies he rode horses well; and in like manner
فَرُسَ [but not followed by الخيل]. (TA.) ―
-b2-
Hence, (assumed tropical:)  He was, or became, skilled in anything
that he endeavoured to do. (TA.)
-A3-  فَرَسَ بِالنَّظَرِ,
[and بِنَظَرِهِ, and بِعَيْنِهِ, and فَرَسَ فِى النَّاسِ, (see
فَارِسٌ,)] aor.
فَرِسَ, (Msb,) inf. n. فِرَاسَةٌ and فَرَاسَةٌ, (As,
IAar, Msb, TA,) accord. to the citation of the
words of As and IAar in the L, but this is at
variance with the opinion generally held, [which
is, that فَرَاسَةٌ is an inf. n. only of فَرُسَ, signifying
as expl. above, and that فِرَاسَةٌ is a subst. from
تَفَرُّسٌ, having no proper verb of which it is an
inf. n.,] (TA,) is said of a man [in the same sense
as تَفَرَّسَ, (q. v.,) as will be seen from the explanations of فِرَاسَةٌ and فَارِسٌ, below]. (Msb.) See
5, latter part, in two places.
-A4-  فَرِسَ He kept
continually, or constantly, to the eating of the
dates called فَرَاس. (O, K.) ―
-b2-  And He pastured
upon, or depastured, the plants called فِرْس. (O, K.)
2
فرّس الغَنَمَ, (inf. n. تَفْرِيسٌ, TA,) He (a wild
beast) seized often the sheep or goats, or seized
many of them, and broke, or crushed so as to
break, their necks. (M, TA.)
-A2-  فرّسه الشَّىْءَ,
(inf. n. as above, TA,) He exposed to him (namely
a wild beast) the thing, [meaning the animal,]
that he might seize it, and break, or crush so as
to break, its neck: and إَيَّاهُ ↓ أَفْرَسَهُ the threw, or
cast, it to him, that he might do so to it: (M:)
and الرَّجُلُ الأَسَدَ حِمَارَهُ ↓ أَفْرَسَ the man left his ass
to the lion, that he might break his neck, or kill
him, or make him his prey, while he himself should
escape. (S, K.) El-'Ajjáj uses the former verb in
relation to the kind of flies called نُعَر, saying,
ضَرْبًا إِذَا صَابَ اليَآفِيخَ احْتَفَرْ
فِى الهَامِ دُحْلَانًا يُفَرِّسْنَ النُّعَرْ
[A beating which, when it falls upon the tops of
heads, digs, in the pates, hollows that afford prey
to the blue stinging flies]; meaning, that these
wounds are wide, and enable the نعر to obtain
thence what they desire. (M.) And one of the
poets uses it in relation to human beings, in the
following verses, [which exhibit an instance of the
license termed إِقْوَآء,] cited by IAar:
قَدْ أَرْسَلُونِى قِى الكَوَاعِبِ رَاعِيًا
↓ فَقَدْ وَأَبِى رَاعِى الكَوَاعِبِ أُفْرَسُ
أَتَتْهُ ذِئَابٌ لَا يُبَالِينَ رَاعِيًا
وَكُنُّ سَوَامًا تَشْتَهِى أَنْ تُفَرَّسَا
[They had sent me among the girls with swelling
breasts, as a guardian; and, by my father, while
guardian of the girls with swelling breasts, or by
the father of the guardian of the girls with swelling breasts, I was (lit. I am) made a prey: there
came thither wolves not caring for a guardian,
and those females were (as) pasturing camels
eagerly desiring to be given as prey]: he likens
these women to pasturing camels, although differing from them inasmuch as the latter do not
eagerly desire to be given as prey, since this
would be a cause of their death, whereas women
do eagerly desire it, since فَرْسُ الرِّجَالِ لِلنِّسَآءِ [lit.
men's making women their prey] is in this case
(assumed tropical:)  men's holding commerce of love with women:
أُفْرَسُ is for فُرِسْتُ; for, as Sb says, they sometimes put أَفْعَلُ in the place of فَعَلْتُ: أَبِى is in
the gen. case as governed by وَ denoting swearing;
and راعى الكواعب may be a denotative of state
relating to the ت [the pronoun of the first person]
understood [in أُفْرَسُ for فُرِسْتُ]; or وأبى may be
prefixed to راعى الكواعب, governing it in the gen.
case, and by the latter expression he may mean
himself: by wolves not caring for a guardian,
he means wicked men not caring for him who
guarded these women: and he uses the word
تشتهى to denote intense desire; for if he did not
mean intenseness, he would have said تُرِيدُ. (M.)
3
فارسهُ, inf. n. مُفَارَسَةٌ and فِرَاسٌ, (M, TA,)
[app., He vied, or contended, with him in horsemanship: this signification seems to be indicated
by what immediately precedes in the M, which is,
فَرَسَ and فَرُسَ “ he became a horseman: ” but
perhaps it may signify he vied, or contended, with
him in فِرَاسَة, meaning insight, &c.: or it may
have both these significations.]
4
افرس He (a pastor) had the neck of one of
his sheep, or goats, broken, or had one of them
killed, (S, O,) or taken, (K,) by the wolf, (S, O,
K,) he being inadvertent. (K.) ―
-b2-  See also 2, in
two places. ―
-b3-  افرس عَنْ بَقِيَّةِ مَالٍ He left a remainder of property [as a prey], having taken all
beside thereof. (AA, O, K.)
5
تفرّس He pretended to others that he was a
horseman, or one skilled in horsemanship. (As, O,
K.)
-A2-  He acted deliberately, (S, O, K, TA,)
and considered, or examined, a thing, or did so
repeatedly, in order to know it, or to obtain a
clear knowledge of it. (S, * K, * TA.) ―
-b2-  تفرّس
فِيهِ الشَّىْءِ [He perceived in him the thing intuitively; or by a kind of thaumaturgic faculty,
and by right opinion and conjecture: or by means
of indications, or evidences, and experiments, and
the make and dispositions: (see فِرَاسَةٌ, below:)
or] he perceived in him the thing by forming a
correct opinion from its outward signs; syn. تَوَسَّمَهُ.
(M.) You say, تَفَرَّسْتُ فِيهِ خَيْرًا, (S, O,) or الخَيْرَ,
(Msb,) [I perceived in him good, or goodness, intuitively; &c.: or] I discovered (تَعَرَّفْتُ) in him
good, or goodness, by right opinion. (Msb.) [↓ فَرَسَ
بِالنَّظَرِ, and بِنَظَرِهِ, and بِعَيْنِهِ, inf. n. فِرَاسَةٌ and فَرَاسَةٌ,
(respecting which, however, see 1, last quarter,)
signifies the same as تفرّس; i. e., He perceived, or
discerned, the internal, inward, or intrinsic, state,
condition, character, or circumstances, by examination of outward indications, &c., and by his
eye. And so فِى النَّاسِ ↓ فَرَسَ He saw into the
internal, inward, or intrinsic, states, &c., of men.
See فِرَاسَةٌ, below.]

فَرْنَسَتْ, as is shown by the mention of the part. n.
مُفَرْنِسَةٌ,] A woman's good managing of the affairs
of her house, or tent: (Lth, K, TA:) the ن is
augmentative. (TA.)
الفُرْسُ: see فَارِسٌ.
فِرْسٌ A species of plant: (Yaakoob, S, M, O,
K:) the قَصْقَاص, (O, and so in copies of the K,)
or قَضْقَاض, (so in the CK,) [each said to be a
name of the أُشْنَان (or kali) of Syria, or of a
species of حَمْض, q. v.,] accord. to Abu-l-Meká-
rim: (O:) or the حَبْن [q. v.]: or the بَرْوَق [q. v.]:

شِرْس. (TA.)
فَرَسٌ [A horse; and a mare;] one of what are

because it crushes and breaks the ground with its
hoofs; (A, O; *) and is applied to the male and
the female; (S, M, A, Mgh, O, Msb, K;) but
mostly applied to the latter; (M;) the female
not being called ↓ فَرَسَةٌ; (S, O;) or the female is
[sometimes] thus called: (Yoo, IJ, M, Msb, K:)
it is applied also to the Arabian, (Mgh, Msb,)
and to the Turkish, (Msb,) or that which is not
Arabian: (Mgh:) or, accord. to Mohammad [the
Hanafee Imám], to the Arabian only; but for
this [says Mtr] I find no authority of a lexicologist, except that ISk, speaking of a solid-hoofed
animal, says, “whether it be a بِرْزَوْن or a فَرَس
or a بَغْل or a حِمَار: ” (Mgh:) the pl. is أَفْرَاسٌ,
(S, M, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) [a pl. of pauc. but used
as a pl. of mult. also,] and أَفْرُسٌ, [a pl. of pauc.
only,] (O,) and فُرُوسٌ: (K:) and as فَرَسٌ is
originally fem., you say ثَلَاثُ أَفْرَاسٍ when you
mean males [as well as when you mean females]:
(M:) or you say ثَلَاثَةُ أَفْرَاسٍ, with ة, when you
mean males; and ثَلَاثُ أَفْرَاسٍ, without ة, when
you mean females: (Msb:) the dim. is فُرَيْسٌ, (S,
O, Msb,) when applied to the male; (Msb;) and
↓ فُرَيْسَةٌ, when applied to the female; (S, O, Msb;)
agreeably with rule; (Msb;) accord. to Aboo-Bekr Ibn-Es-Sarráj: (S, O:) or ↓ فُرَيْسٌ when
applied to the female [also], which is extr. (Sb,
M. [See حَرْبٌ.]) ―
-b2-  هُمَا كَفَرَسَىْ رِهَانٍ [They two
are like two horses running for a wager] is a
saying applied to two persons running a race to
a goal, and being equal: (A, O, K:) the comparison relating to the beginning [of a contest],
for the termination necessarily shows which outstrips; (O, K:) and to two who are equal, and
two who are nearly equal, in excellence &c. (Har
p. 640.) It was said by a man who swore that
he would abstain from his wife for four months,
and then divorced her: for the period during
which a woman may be taken back after a [first
or second] divorce is that of three menstruations
or three periods of purity from menstruation; and
if it ended in this case before the end of the four
months during which he swore to abstain from
her, she became separated from him by that
divorcement: so he likened the two periods to
two horses running for a wager. (O, * TA.) ―
-b3-

of the Nile;] the hippopotamus. (Dmr. [See also

(Kzw.) ―
-b5-  قِطْعَةُ الفَرَسِ (assumed tropical:)  [The Piece of the Horse;]

(assumed tropical:)  [The Complete horse;] a certain constellation
composed of thirty-one stars, in which a portion
of the constellation called الفَرَسُ الأَعْظَمُ is included.
(Kzw. [It is further described by him; but in a
manner that does not enable me to identify it
with any of the constellations named by our
astronomers.])
الفَرْسَةُ, (IAar, S, M, O, K, TA,) or ↓ الفِرْسَةُ,
(M, TA,) the former accord. to A'Obeyd, (M,
TA,) or, accord. to A'Obeyd, it is with ص, and
the vulgar, he says, pronounce it with س, (O,)
Gibbosity [of the back]; syn. الحَدَبُ: (IAar, O,
TA:) or, (M, O, K, TA,) as also الفَرْصَةُ, (M,
O,) which latter is the more approved in this
sense, (M,) the رِيح [or flatus] of gibbosity; (M,
O, K, TA;) [i. e.] the ريح that renders gibbous;
(M;) as though it were breaking, or crushing so
as to break, the back (كَأَنَّهَا تَفْرِسُ الظَّهْرَ أَىْ تَدُقُّهُ),
and cleaving it (تَفْرِصُهُ أَىْ تَشُقُّهُ): (O:) [or الفَرْسَةُ
signifies the displacement of one of the vertebræ;
for,] accord. to As, one says أَصَابَتْهُ فَرْسَةٌ when
one of the vertebræ of one's back has become displaced; but the flatus (الرِّيحُ) from which gibbosity results is termed الفَرْصَةُ, with ص: (TA:)
or الفَرْسَةُ signifies a flatus that attacks in the
neck, and breaks it: (S:) or, as some say, an
imposthume, or ulcer, (قَرْحَة,) that is in the neck,
breaking it: (M:) or a breach (فُرْجَة) in the
neck; thus says AZ: or a breach (فرجة) that is
in [the case of] gibbosity: the pl. is فَرَسَاتٌ, not
أَفْرِسَةٌ, which latter is said to be a pl. of فَرْسَةٌ, but
is anomalous. (TA.)
فُرْسَةٌ and فُرْصَةٌ; the latter of which is the more
approved in both of the following senses; i. q.
نَوْبَةٌ [meaning A turn; or time at which, or
during which, a thing is, or is to be, done, or had,
in succession; as also فُرْزَةٌ: pl. فُرَسٌ]: فُرَسُ الوِرْدِ
[the turns, or times, for coming to water in succession] means [the occasions of] persons' being
left free to come to water. (M. [See فُرْصَةٌ.]) ―
-b2-

the owner of the ass, فَارِسٌ, but I call them بَغَّالٌ
and حَمَّارٌ: (S, O, Msb:) [فَارِسٌ is often best rendered a cavalier:] the pl. is فُرْسَانٌ (S, M, Msb)
and فَوَارِسُ, which latter is [more usual, but]
anomalous, (S, M, O, Msb, K,) for فَوَاعِلُ is [regularly] the measure of the pl. of a sing. of the
measure فَاعِلَةٌ, as ضَوَارِبُ, pl. of ضَارِبَةٌ, or of an
epithet of the measure فَاعِلٌ applying to a female,
as حَوَائِضُ, pl. of حَائِضٌ, or of a sing. of the
measure فَاعِلٌ applying to a thing that is not a
human being or not a rational being, as بَوَازِلُ,
pl. of بَازِلٌ, and حَوَائِطٌ, pl. of حَائِطٌ; and there
are no instances like فَوَارِسُ except those of هَوَالِكُ
and نَوَاكِسُ [and خَوَالِفُ and some other words
enumerated in the Msb and TA]; (S, Msb;) and
as فوارس is not applied to females, no ambiguity
is feared from its usage: (S, O:) [ISd says,] we
have not heard اِمْرَأَةٌ فَارِسَةٌ. (M.) ―
-b2-  Also, (As,)
or فَارِسٌ عَلَى الخَيْلِ, (S,) A man skilful in horsemanship, or in the management of horses. (As, *
S.) ―
-b3-  And hence, the former, (فارس,) (assumed tropical:)  A man
skilful in anything that he endeavours to do. (TA.)
―
-b4-  الفَوَارِسُ is the name of (assumed tropical:)  Four stars of the constellation Cygnus. (Kzw. See دَجَاجٌ.)
-A3-  رَجُلٌ
فَارِسُ النَّظَرِ, (S, O, TA,) and بِنَظَرِهِ, and بِعَيْنِهِ,
(As,) A man who acts deliberately, and examines:
(S, and so in Hr p. 356:) who possesses فِرَاسَة [i. e.

فَارِسٌ فِى النَّاسِ [Seeing into the internal, inward,
or intrinsic, states, &c., of men]. (IAar.)
-A4-  فَارِسُ,
(S, M, Mgh, K,) or فَارِسٌ, (so in some copies of
the K,) [the former if fem., as it is a proper name,
the latter if masc.,] A certain nation; (Mgh, Msb;)
[namely, the Persians;] i. q. ↓ الفُرْسُ: (S, O, K:)
generally fem.: (Msb:) فُرْسٌ is pl. of ↓ فَارِسِىٌّ,
which is a rel. n. from فَارِسُ in the sense next
following: (M:) [or, rather, فُرْسٌ is a coll. gen. n.,
and فَارِسِىٌّ is its n. un.] ―
-b2-  Also, (S, O, but in
the K “ or ”) The country of the فُرْس; (S, O, K;)
[i. e., Persia;] a country of a certain nation. (M.)
فَارِسِىٌّ [Persian: a Persian]: see فَارِسُ. Hence,
التَّمْرُ الفَارِسِىُّ A certain sort of dates, (Mgh, Msb,)
of good quality. (Msb.)
أَفْرَسُ: see مَفْرُوسٌ.
-A2-  It is also a noun of
excess, or a comparative and superlative epithet,
from فِرَاسَةٌ, used by Zj, in the phrase أَفْرَسُ النَّاسِ,
meaning, The best, (M,) or best and most true,
(TA,) in فِرَاسَة, [i. e., insight, or intuitive perception, &c.,] of mankind. (M, TA.) One says also,
أَنَا أَفْرَسُ مِنْكَ I am more endowed with mental
perception, [or insight, or intuitive perception,]
and more knowing, than thou. (TA.)
مَفْرُوسٌ Having the back broken: (M, TA:)
and so مَفْرُوزٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And Humpbacked; as also
↓ فَرِيْسٌ, (M, TA,) and ↓ أَفْرَسُ (Fr in TA voce
أَعْجَرُ) [and أَفْرَصُ and أَفْرَزُ].
المُفْتَرِسُ: see الفَارِسُ.
