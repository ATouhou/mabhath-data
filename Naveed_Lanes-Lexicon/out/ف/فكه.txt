فكه1
فَكِهَ, aor.
فَكَهَ, inf. n. فَكَاهَةٌ (S, Mgh, K) and
فَكَهٌ, (K, TA,) [the latter inf. n. correctly thus,
agreeably with a general rule, in the CK with
the ك quiescent, but said in the TA to be
بالتحريك,] (assumed tropical:)  He was, or became, cheerful, happy,
or free from straitness; (S, Mgh, K;) jocose, or
given to jesting, (S, Mgh,) and to laughing: (Mgh,
K:) or one who talked to his companions and
made them to laugh. (K.) ―
-b2-  See also 5.
2
فَكَّهَهُمْ, inf. n. تَفْكِيهٌ, He brought to them
فَاكِهَة [i. e. fruit]. (K.) ―
-b2-  And [hence] فَكَّهَهُمْ
بِمُلَحِ الكَلَامِ, inf. n. as above, (tropical:)  He entertained
them in a novel manner with facetious sayings or
talk. (K, TA.)
3
فاكههُ, (K,) inf. n. مُفَاكَهَةٌ, (S,) (tropical:)  He jested,
or joked, with him; (S, K, TA;) indulged in
pleasantry with him. (TA.) It is said in a prov.,
لَا تُفَاكِهْ أَمَةً وَلَاتَبُلْ عَلَى أَكَمَةٍ (tropical:)  [Jest not thou
with a female slave, and make not water upon a
hillock, i. e. and publish not what is secret of thine
affair: see art. اكم]. (S, TA.) [See also an
ex. in a verse cited voce تَزَنَّدَ.]
4
أَفْكَهَتْ She (a camel) yielded her milk plentifully on the occasion of eating the [herbage called]
رَبِيع, before her bringing forth: (S, TA:) or she
being near to bringing forth, her صَلَوَانِ [app.
meaning two parts on the right and left of the
tail (see صَلًا in art. صلو)] became lax, or flaccid,
and her udder became large; like أَفَكَّت. (TA in
art. فك. [See also the part. n., below.])
5
تفكّه He ate fruit (فَاكِهَة): (Msb, K:) and
He took fruit with his hand, [he helped himself
to it;] syn. تَنَاوَلَ الفَاكِهَةَ: and hence, as is said
in the A, (TA,) the saying in the Kur [lvi. 65],
فَظَلْتُمْ تَفَكَّهُونَ is ironical, meaning [And then ye
would be in the condition of] making your fruit
to be your saying إِنَّا لَمُغْرَمُونَ Verily we are burdened with debt (which words occur in the next
verse)]: or تَفَكَّهَ here [or rather in a case of this
kind] means He threw away from himself the
fruit: thus says Ibn-'Ateeyeh, (K, TA,) in his
exposition: (TA:) [but see other explanations
in what follows:] and it signifies also He
abstained from fruit: thus it bears two contr.
meanings. (K.) ―
-b2-  And sometimes [it means
(tropical:)  He amused himself with talk; like as one
amuses himself with the eating of fruit after a
meal; i. e.] التَّفَكُّهُ is metaphorically used as
meaning التَّنَقُّلُ بِالحَدِيثِ. (Bd in lvi. 65.) ―
-b3-
And (assumed tropical:)  He affected jesting, or joking. (TA.) ―
-b4-
And تفكّهوا بِفُلَانٍ (assumed tropical:) They spoke evil of such a one;
or did so in his absence; and defamed him; and
did thus with jesting, one with another. (TA.) ―
-b5-
And تفكّه بِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He enjoyed it: (S, Msb, K:) and
[particularly] (Msb) he enjoyed the eating of it.
(Mgh, Msb.) ―
-b6-  And تفكّه also signifies (assumed tropical:)  He
wondered, (S, Msb, K,) مِنْهُ at it; and so ↓ فَكِهَ,
followed likewise by منه. (K.) And hence
[accord. to some] the saying in the Kur cited
above, فَظَلْتُمْ تَفَكَّهُونَ i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [And then ye would be
in the condition of] wondering at what had
befallen you in respect of your seed-produce.
(TA.) ―
-b7-  And He repented, grieved, lamented,
or regretted: (IAar, S, K:) and the words of
the Kur cited in the last sentence above, (S, TA,)
as expl. by some, (TA,) mean [And then ye would
be in the condition of] repenting, &c.: (S, TA:)
and so تَفَكَّنُونَ, which is of the dial. of 'Okl; or,
accord. to Lh, Temeem say تَتَفَكَّنُونَ, and AzdShanoo-ah say تَتَفَكَّهُونَ. (TA.)
6
تَفَاكُهٌ signifies The jesting, or joking, [or
indulging in pleasantry, (see 3,) of a number of
persons,] one with another, (K.) [You say,
تفاكهوا They jested, &c., one with another.]
فَكِهٌ Eating, or an eater of, فَاكِهَة [i. e. fruit];
(K, TA;) a possessive epithet; applied to a man.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  Also, (S, Mgh, K,) and ↓ فَاكِهٌ, (K,
TA, in the CK فَاكِهَةٌ,) and ↓ فيكهان [app. فَيْكَهَانٌ
or فَيْكِهَانٌ, like تيَّهَانٌ], (AZ, TA,) (assumed tropical:)  Cheerful,
happy, or free from straitness; (AZ, S, Mgh, K;)
jocose, or given to jesting, (AZ, S, Mgh,) and to
laughing: (Mgh, K:) or the first, (K, TA,) and
second, (K,) one who talks to his companions and
makes them to laugh: (K, TA:) and فَكِهَاتٌ,
applied to women, cheerful, happy, or free from
straitness. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And فَكِهٌ signifies also
(assumed tropical:)  Exulting, or rejoicing above measure; or exulting greatly, and behaving insolently and unthankfully, or ungratefully: (S, TA:) and thus the
pl. فَكِهِينَ signifies in the Kur (S, Mgh) xlix. 26
[as some there read]: (S:) ↓ فَاكِهِينَ [is the more
common reading and] means enjoying an easy and
a pleasant life; or enjoying case and plenty. (S,
Mgh.) ―
-b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  Wondering: and thus some
explain the pl. فَكِهُونَ in the Kur xxxvi. 55.
(TA.) ―
-b5-  هُوَ فَكِهٌ بِأَعْرَاضِ النَّاسِ means (tropical:)  He is one
who delights in speaking evil of men, or in doing
so in their absence. (K, TA.)
[
فَكِيهْ is said by Golius to signify “ Qui proloqui
non potest,” on the authority of the KL: but in
my copy of the KL, I find that the word to
which this meaning is assigned is فَهِيهٌ.]
فُكَاهَةٌ, a subst. [as distinguished from the inf. n.
فَكَاهَةٌ], (S, K,) A jesting, or joking; (S, Mgh,
Msb, K;) as also ↓ فَكِيهَةٌ. (K.)
فَكِيهَةٌ: see what next precedes.
فَاكِهٌ Possessing فَاكِهَة [i. e. fruit]; (K, TA:)
an epithet of the same class as تَامِرٌ and لَابِنٌ: or,
accord. to Aboo-Mo'ádh the grammarian, one
whose fruit has become abundant. (TA.) ―
-b2-  See
also فَكِهٌ, in two places. ―
-b3-  And [the fem.] فَاكِهَةٌ,
(assumed tropical:)  A palm-tree (نَخْلَةٌ) inducing wonder, or admiration, and pleasure, or joy; or pleasing, or (??)
joicing; [app. by its having much fruit;] syn.
مُعْجِبَةٌ. (K.)
فَاكِهَةٌ a word of well-known meaning, (S,)
Fruit, of any kind; (K;) a thing, or things, the
eating whereof is enjoyed, (Mgh, Msb,) whether
moist or dry, as figs and melons and raisins
and pomegranates: (Msb:) [the words, of the
Kur lv. 68, فِيهِمَا فَاكِهَةٌ وَنَخْلٌ وَرُمَّانٌ have
caused it to be much and vainly disputed whether
dates and pomegranates be, or be not, included
among the things termed فاكهة: it seems to be
the general opinion of the lexicologists that they
are included; but the contrary opinion is held
by many of the lawyers, and by the Imám Aboo-
Haneefeh among them:] the pl. is فَوَاكِهُ, meaning kinds thereof. (S.) ―
-b2-  And (by way of comparison [thereto], TA) (tropical:)  Sweetmeat; syn. حَلْوَآء;
(K;) which is also applied by some to “ fruit ”
(فاكهة), (T in art. حلو,) or to “ sweet fruit. ” (K
in that art.) ―
-b3-  And فَاكِهَةُ الشِّتَآءِ [lit. The fruit
of winter] is metonymically used as meaning (tropical:)  the
fire. (Har p. 594.)
فَاكِهِىٌّ: see فَاكِهَانِىٌّ.
فيكهان:see فَكِهٌ, second sentence.
فَاكِهَانِىٌّ A seller of فَاكِهَة [i. e. fruit]; (S, K;)
as also ↓ فَاكِهِىٌّ; (TA;) but not فَكَّاهٌ. (Sb, TA.)
كَانَ مِنْ أَفْكَهِ النَّاسِ occurs in two trads. [as
meaning (assumed tropical:)  He was of the most cheerful and jocose
of men]. (TA [in which the meaning is indicated
by the context].)
أُفْكُوهَةٌ i. q. أُعْجُوبَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  [A wonderful thing]. (K.)
You say, جَآءَ فُلَانٌ بِأُفْكُوهَةٍ (assumed tropical:)  [Such a one did, or
uttered, a wonderful thing]. (TA.)
مُفْكِهٌ (AZ, S, K) and مُفْكِهَةٌ (K) A she-camel
whose milk is thick, (K, TA,) like biestings: (TA:)
or that yields her milk plentifully on the occasion
of eating the [herbage called] رَبِيع, before her
bringing forth: (S:) or whose milk pours forth
on the occasion of parturition, before her bringing
forth: or, accord. to Sh, the meaning is that
indicated by the second explanation of the verb,
4 [q. v.]. (TA.)
