فخذ1
فَخَذَهُ, (S, O, L, K,) aor.
فَخَذَ, (TA, and so
accord. to some copies of the K, in which the
verb is said to be like مَنَعَهُ,) or
فَخِذَ, (so in other
copies of the K,) inf. n. فَخْذٌ, (L,) He hit, or
hurt, his (another's) thigh: (S, L, K:) or he
broke his thigh: like as one says رَأَسَهُ and رَجَلَهُ.
(O.) And فُخِذَ He was hit, or hurt, in his thigh:
(M, L, K:) or his thigh was broken. (A.)

فَخَّذَ see 5, in two places. ―
-b2-  فخّذ عَشِيرَتَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He
called his عشيرة [or kinsfolk] فَخِذ by فَخِذ [i. e.
one small body of families after another], (S,
Mgh, * O, L, K, *) inf. n. تَفْخِيذٌ: (TA:) from a
trad. (S, O, L.) ―
-b3-  And فَخَّذَهُمْ, inf. n. as above;
(K;) or فخّذ بَيْنَهُمْ; (L;) (assumed tropical:)  He dispersed them,
and abstained from aiding them; syn. فَرَّقَهُمْ
وَخَذَلَهُمْ: (L, K: [but see what follows:]) and
(L) فخّذهم (O, L, Msb) عَنْ فُلَانٍ, (O, L,) inf. n.
as above, (O, L, Msb,) signifies خذلهم, (L, Msb,
[in both written without any of the syll. signs,])
or خذّلهم عَنْهُ [which is evidently the right reading (i. e. he induced them to abstain from aiding
such a one), and I believe it to be the right reading also in the explanation given immediately
before from the L and K]: (O:) and فخّذ بَيْنَهُمْ
he dispersed them. (O, Msb.)

فَاْخَذَ see the next paragraph, in two places.

تفخّذ المَرْأَةَ He (a man, Msb) sat between
the thighs of the woman (Mgh, Msb) as he sits
who performs [or is about to perform] the act of
coïtus; as also ↓ فاخذها, [inf. n. مُفَاخَذَةٌ;] and
↓ فخّذها, inf. n. تَفْخِيذٌ: (Msb:) or he sat above
the thighs of the woman: (Mgh:) ↓ التَّفْخِيذُ signifies the same as ↓ المُفَاخَذَةُ [app. agreeably with
the former or the latter of the explanations above].
(S, O, L.)
-A2-  And تفخّذ He retired, or held back,
(O, K,) عَنِ الأَمْرِ from the affair. (O.)

استفخذ i. q. اِسْتَخْذَى, (Fr, O, K, TA,)
i. e. He was, or became, lowly, humble, or submissive; and so اِسْتَخْذَأَ. (TA in arts. خذى and
خذأ.)
فَخِذٌ and فَخْذٌ (S, O, L, Msb, K) and فِخْذٌ (S,
O, L, K) and فِخِذٌ, (L, TA,) as Ez-Zarkashee
says in his Expos. of El-Bukháree, (TA,) for in
the case of every faucial medial radical of a word
of the measure فَعِل, whether a noun like فَخِذٌ or
a verb like شَهِدَ, there are four dial. vars., namely,
فَعِل and فَعْل and فِعْل and فِعِل; (Seer, O, TA;)
thus it is said in the Tes-heel of Ibn-Málik; and
MF says that the first three forms are common
to every word of the measure of كَتِف though
without a faucial letter; (TA;) The thigh; i. e.
the limb (وصل [i. e. وُِصْل, but in the O written
وَصْل,]) between the سَاق and the وَرِك; (Mgh, * O,
L, K; *) so says Lth; (O;) and in this sense,
the first of the forms above mentioned is the
most chaste: (MF:) it is of the fem. gender:
(Mgh, O, L, Msb, K:) pl. أَفْخَاذٌ, (Sb, L, Msb,
K,) the only pl. form. (Sb, L.) ―
-b2-  Also (tropical:)  A
small sub-tribe, or portion of the tribe, consisting
of the nearest of the kinsfolk of a man; (Kh, A, *
O, L, K; *) less than a بَطْن; the first [i. e.
largest] body being the شَعْب, then the قَبِيلَة, then
the فَصِيلَة, then the عِمَارَة, then the بَطْن, and then
the فَخِْذ: (S, O, L:) or it is below the قَبِيلَة but
above the بَطْن; and is pronounced with the خ
quiescent: (IDrd, O:) or below the فَصِيلَة but
above the بَطْن: (Msb:) or below the بَطْن and
above the فَصِيلَة: (Mgh, Msb:) this last, accord.
to IB and Aboo-Usámeh, is the true order; (TA
voce شعب, q. v.;) and AM says that the فَصِيلَة
is nearer than the فخذ: (L:) in this sense, the
second of the forms above mentioned is the most
chaste: (MF:) and in this sense it is of the
masc. gender; (A, Mgh, O, Msb;) because meaning نَفَرٌ; (Msb;) wherefore you say, هٰذَا فَخْذِى:
(A:) pl. as above. (A, O, L, K.) ―
-b3-  حُلِبَتِ النَّاقَةُ
فِى فَخِذِهَا is a phrase mentioned by Fr, meaning
(assumed tropical:)  [The she-camel was milked] in her half-month
[app. at the period commencing half a month
after her parturition]. (O.)
فَخْذَآءُ A woman that holds a man firmly between her thighs, (Msb, K, TA,) by reason of her
strength. (TA.)
مَفْخُوذٌ A man hit, or hurt, in his thigh: (M,
L:) or whose thigh is broken. (A.)
