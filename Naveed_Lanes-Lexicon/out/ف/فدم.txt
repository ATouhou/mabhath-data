فَدِمَ, and ↓ فدّم,
(M, K, TA,) inf. n. تَفْدِيمٌ; (TA;) he put the
فِدَام upon his, or its, mouth: (M, K:) [app. used
in relation to a man and also to an إِبْرِيق or other
vessel: but the latter verb, and as trans. without
a particle, seems to be more commonly used in
relation to both:] one says of Persians or other
foreigners, and of Magians, on the occasion of
their giving to drink, أَفْوَاهَهُمْ ↓ فَدَّمُوا They bound
the فَدَّام upon their mouths: (T:) and ↓ فدّم
الإِبْرِيقَ, (M, K,) inf. n. تَفْدِيمٌ, (K,) He put the

فَدَّمَ see the preceding paragraph, in three places.
One says also, فدّم البَعِيرَ, meaning He bound upon
the camel's mouth the فِدَامَة, (M,) which means
the غِمَامَة [q. v.]. (TA.)
فَدْمٌ Impotent (T, S, M, K) in speech, (T, M,
K,) and in adducing an argument; (T, M;) [as
though his mouth were covered with a فِدَام, for
it is said in the S to be from فَدَمْتُ عَلَى فِيهِ
بِالفِدَامِ;] heavy, sluggish, or dull; (S;) or with
heaviness, sluggishness, or dulness, and softness, and
paucity of understanding: (M, K:) or unintelligent: (Msb:) and thick; (M, K;) fat; (M;)
foolish, or stupid; rough, rude, or uncivil: (M,
K:) accord. to IAar, the heavy, sluggish, or dull;
as being likened to blood, which is thus called:
(T:) and ثَدْمٌ is a dial. var. thereof, or, accord.
to Yaakoob, the ث is a substitute for the ف: (M:)
the fem. is with ة: (M, Msb, K:) and the pl. is
فِدَامٌ [agreeably with analogy]. (M, K: in a
copy of the T فُدُم [which I think a mistranscription].) ―

Persians or other foreigners, (T, K,) and the
Magians, (K,) bind upon their mouths on the
occasion of their giving to drink; (T, K;) or a
piece of cloth with which the Magian binds his
mouth; (S;) or a sort of thing with which the
Persians or other foreigners wipe [app. the mouth]
when they give to drink; one of which is termed
↓ فَدَّامَةٌ. (M. [In the S it seems to be implied
that this last word is syn. with فَدَّامٌ as expl.
above.]) ―

also called ثِدَامٌ. (M.) ―
-b3-  And فِدَامٌ signifies
also the same as عِمَامَةٌ: thus in copies of the K
[and in a copy of the M]: but the former word
is correctly ↓ فِدَامَةٌ [as is implied in one place in
the M]; and the word by which it is explained is
correctly غِمَامَهٌ, [as in some copies of the K,]
meaning A thing that is put upon the mouth of
