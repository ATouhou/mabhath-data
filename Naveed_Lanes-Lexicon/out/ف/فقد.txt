فَقَدَهُ, (S, A, MA, Mgh, O, L, Msb, K,) aor.
فَقِدَ,
(S, A, O, &c.,) inf. n. فَقْدٌ and فِقْدَانٌ (S, MA,
O, L, Msb, K) and فُقْدَانٌ (S, O, F) and فُقُودٌ;
(IDrd, O, L, K;) and ↓ افتقدهُ; (S, A, MA,
Mgh, O;) He found it not, (L, TA,) lost it,
(MA, PS, &c.,) saw it not, (JK in explanation
of the latter verb,) [missed, or failed of finding
or seeing, it,] it was, or became, absent from him,
(Mgh,) or he had it not, was destitute of it, was
without it, lacked it, or wanted it, syn. عَدِمَهُ;
(Msb, L, K;) but accord. to Er-Rághib, الفَقْدُ
has a more special signification than العَدَمُ, this
latter being the contr. of الوُجُودُ; (TA;) [whereas]
الفَقْدُ [as inf. n. of فُقِدَ, though often used as
meaning the being non-existent, properly] signifies
the thing's being absent from the range of perception by sense so that its place is not known. (Bd
in xii. 71.) [فُقِدَ signifies It was not found, was
lost, was not seen, &c.] It is related of Abu-dDardà that he said, يَفْقِدْ ↓ مَنْ يَتَفَقَّدْ, [lit. He
who seeks will not find,] meaning he who seeks after
good in mankind will not find it; for he saw good
to be rare in mankind: or he who seeks to acquaint
himself with the circumstances of men will not
find what will please him. (L.)
4
أَفْقَدَهُ اللّٰهُ إِيَّاهُ God caused him to lose, or fail
of finding, him, or it. (L, K.) One says, أَفْقَدَكَ
اللّٰهُ كُلَّ جَمِيمٍ [May God cause thee to lose every
relation, or loved and loving relation]. (A.) [Or]
الإِفْقَادُ is not of established authority: as to the
saying الجُنُونُ يُفْقِدُ شَهْوَةَ الجِمَاعِ [meaning Insanity causes to lose, or annuls, the desire of coïtus],
the correct word is يُعْدِمُ or يُزِيلُ. (Mgh.)
5
تفقّدهُ He sought it, or sought for it or after
it; or did so leisurely or repeatedly; (A, * Mgh,
L;) as also ↓ افتقدهُ: (Mgh, L:) or he sought it,
or sought for it or after it, it being absent from
him; (S, O, L, Msb, K;) as also ↓ افتقدهُ: (K:)
or he sought, or sought leisurely or repeatedly, to
obtain knowledge of it, having lost it: so accord.
to Er-Rághib and many others; but this expression and تعَهَّدَهُ are used, by some, each in the
place of the other, and the latter, accord. to Er-Rághib and many others, [properly] signifies he
sought, or sought leisurely or repeatedly, to obtain
knowledge of it, having known it before. (MF.)
You say, ↓ مَا تَفَقَّدْتُهُ مُنْذُ افْتَقَدْتُهُ, meaning منذ
فَقَدْتُهُ [i. e. I have not sought for, or after, him,
or it, since I lost him, or it. (B, TA.) See also
1, last sentence. ―
-b2-  [Also He investigated it.]
6
تفاقدوا means فَقَدَ بَعْضُهُمْ بَعْضًا [i. e. They
lost one another]. (S, O, K.)

الفَقْدُ, (O, K,) by Az, (K,) or in a number of
the copies of the work of Az, (O,) erroneously
written الفَقَدُ, (O, K,) A certain plant, (K,) resembling the [species of cuscuta, or dodder, called]
كَشُوث: (TA:) and a beverage prepared from
raisins or honey or [the plant] كشوث, as also
↓ الفُقْدُدُ: (K:) or, as AHn says, a certain plant
which is thrown into the beverage of honey, which
beverage consequently becomes strong, and is then
called الفَقْدُ: he says, the فَقْد is what is called in
Pers. فَنْجَنْكُشْت: IAar says, ↓ الفِقْدَةُ [or الفَقْدَةُكشوث ?
then. un.] is the كشوث: and a beverage prepared
from raisins and honey; and it is said that a
beverage (نَبِيذ) is made of honey, and then the
فَقْد is thrown into it, and causes it to become
strong: so says Lth: and he says that the فَقْد is
a plant resembling the كشوث: and ↓ الفُقْدُدُ is
the نَبِيذ of the كشوث. (O.)
الفَِقْدَةُ: see the next preceding paragraph.
الفُقْدُدُ: see الفَقْدُ, in two places.
فَقِيدٌ and ↓ مَفْقُودٌ signify the same, (O, Msb,
K,) [Not found, lost, not seen, missed, non-existent,]
absent from one, (Mgh in explanation of the latter,)
not had, lacking or lacked, wanting or wanted.
(Msb, K.) One says, مَاتَ غَيْرَ فَقِيدٍ وَلَا حَمِيدٍ,
(A, K,) and وَلَا مَحْمُودٍ ↓ غَيْرَ مَفْقُودٍ, (A,) [He
died unmissed and unpraised; or,] without his
loss being cared for [and without being praised].
(A, K.)
فَاقِدٌ [as act. part. n. of 1 signifies Not finding
a thing, losing it, not seeing it, missing it, not
having it, being destitute of it, lacking it, or wanting it; or having failed to find it, having lost it,
or having failed to see it. ―
-b2-  And hence,] A
woman who is bereft of her child [by death]:
(A 'Obeyd:) or who loses (تَفْقِدُ) her husband or
child: (S, O:) or whose husband, or child, (L,
K, TA,) or relation, or loved and loving relation,
(TA,) has died: (L, K, TA:) or who marries
after the death of her husband. (Lth, L, K.) The
Arabs say, لَا تَتَزَوَّجَنَّ فَاقِدًا وَتَزَوَّجْ مُطَلَّقَةً [Do
not thou marry a woman whose husband has died,
but [rather] marry thou a divorced woman]. (Lh,
L.) ―
-b3-  And in like manner, (O,) it is applied
also to a she-gazelle, (S, O, L,) and to a cow
[app. a wild cow], (O, L, K,) as also فَاقِدَةٌ, (O,)
meaning Whose young one has been devoured by a
beast, or bird, of prey; (O, L, K;) and to a
pigeon (حَمَامَة) likewise. (L.)
مَفْقُودٌ: see فَقِيدٌ, in two places.
