فطر1
فَطَرَهُ, (S, M, K,) aor.
فَطُرَ, (M, K, TA,) and,
accord. to the K,
فَطِرَ also, but this latter form

camel, and not unrestrictedly, (TA,) inf. n. فَطْرٌ;
(S, M;) and ↓ فطّرهُ, (M, TA,) inf. n. تَفْطِيرٌ;

muchness, or frequency, or repetition, of the

Originater, or Creator, of the heavens] until two
Arabs of the desert came to me, disputing together
respecting a well, and one of them said أَنَا فَطَرْتُهَا,

of those who break their fast, and so though he

occurring in the saying هَلْ تَرَى مِنْ فُطُورٍ [Dost
thou see any clefts?], in the Kur [lxvii. 3]. (TA.)
-A2-  'Omar, being asked respecting [the discharge
termed] المَذْى, answered, It is الفَطْرُ: (O, K:)
thus as related by A 'Obeyd: (TA:) it is said
that he likened it, in respect of its paucity, to
what is drawn from the udder by means of the
milking termed الفَطْرُ: (O, K:) or, as some say,
it is from تَفَطَّرَتْ قَدَمَاهُ دَمًا [expl. above]: (TA:)
or he likened its coming forth from the orifice of
the ذَكَر to the coming forth of the نَاب of the
camel: or, as it is related by En-Nadr, he said
↓ الفُطْرُ, with damm: meaning the milk that
appears upon the orifice of the teat of the udder.

dán; sometimes called الفِطْرُ alone.] ↓ الفِطْرَةُ

the fast], (O, K, TA,) which is a صَاع [q. v.] of
wheat: the prefixed noun (صدقه) is rejected,

language. (TA.)

created in his mother's womb; (AHeyth, K;) i. q.
خِلْقَةٌ. (S, Mgh.) It is said to have this signification in the Kur xxx. 29. (TA.) And so in
the saying of Mohammad, كُلُّ مَوْلُودٍ يُولَدُ عَلَى
الفِطْرَةِ Every infant is born in a state of conformity to the natural constitution with which he is
created in his mother's womb, either prosperous or
unprosperous [in relation to the soul]; and if his
parents are Jews, they make him a Jew, with
respect to his worldly predicament; [i. e., with
respect to inheritances &c.;] and if Christians,
they make him a Christian, with respect to that
predicament; and if Magians, they make him a
Magian, with respect to that predicament; his
predicament is the same as that of his parents
until his tongue speaks for him: but if he die
before his attaining to the age when virility begins
to show itself, he dies in a state of conformity to
his preceding natural constitution, with which he
was created in his mother's womb. (AHeyth,
TA.) [See another explanation of the word, as
occurring in this trad., below.] ―
-b3-  Nature; constitution; or natural, native, innate, or original,

idiosyncrasy. (Th, TA.) ―
-b4-  The faculty of knowing God, with which He has created mankind:
(TA:) the natural constitution with which a child
is created in his mother's womb, whereby he is
capable of accepting the religion of truth: this is
a secondary application: and this is [said to be]
the signification meant in the trad. mentioned
above. (Mgh.) ―
-b5-  Hence, The religion of el-Islám: (Mgh:) the profession whereby a man
becomes a Muslim, which is the declaration that
there is no deity but God, and that Mohammad
is his servant and his apostle, who brought the
truth from Him, and this is (AHeyth, TA) religion. (AHeyth, K, TA.) This is shown by a
trad., in which it is related that Mohammad
taught a man to repeat certain words when lying
down to sleep, and said فَإِنَّكَ إِنْ مُتَّ مِنْ لَيْلَتِكَ
مُتَّ عَلَى الفِطْرَةِ [And then, if thou die that same
night, thou diest in the profession of the true religion]. (AHeyth, TA.) Also by the saying, قَصُّ
الأَظْفَارِ مِنَ الفِطْرَةِ The paring of the nails is [a
point] of the religion of el-Islám. (Mgh.) ―
-b6-  Also
i. q. سُنَّةٌ [app. meaning The way, course, mode, or
manner, of acting, or conduct, or the like, pursued,
and prescribed to be followed, by Mohammad].

K;) and (K) that will not cut: (IAar, O, K:)

though the latter were a rel. n. from the former,
(S,) A breakfast; a thing [i. e. food or beverage]
upon which one breaks his fast. (S, Msb, K.)
فَطِيرٌ Dough unleavened; or not left until it has
become good [or mature]; contr. of خَمِيرٌ: (S,
TA:) and in like manner clay, or mud. (TA.)
[Hence,] عِيدُ الفَطِيرِ [The feast of unleavened
bread; also called, of the Passover;] a festival
of the Jews, [commencing] on the fifteenth day of
their month نِيسَان, and lasting seven days. (Msb.
[See also الفِصْحُ.]) ―
-b2-  Anything prepared, made,
or done, hastily, or hurried, so as to prevent its
becoming mature: (Lth, S, K:) fresh; recent;
newly made: (S, TA:) pl. فَطْرَى: (Sgh, IAth,
TA:) for أَطْعَمَهُ فَطْرَى, in the K, expl. as meaning [He fed him] with فَطِير, is a gross mistake, a
mistranscription of أَطْعِمَةٌ فَطْرَى, as the phrase
stands in the handwriting of Sgh himself, in wellformed letters, and with the syll. signs, meaning
meats [newly prepared, &c.]. (TA.) You say
عِنْدِى خُبْزٌ خَمِيرٌ وَحَيْسٌ فَطِيرٌ [I have leavened
bread, and] fresh, recent, or newly made, حيس
[q. v.]. (S, TA.) You say also إِيَّاكَ وَالرَّأْىَ الفَطِيرُ
(tropical:)  Beware thou of a hastily formed, immature,
opinion. (S.) And شَرُّ الرَّأْىِ الفَطِيرُ (tropical:)  [The worst
opinion is the hastily formed, and immature].

(IAar, O, K, * TA;) such as is termed فَدْم [impotent in speech or actions, heavy, or dull; &c.]:

See 1.
فُوطِيرٌ a subst. for الجِمَاع, in Syriac. (TA.)
أُفْطُورٌ, and the pl. أَفَاطِيرُ: see the next paragraph.
تَفَاطِيرُ, a word similar to تَعَاشِيبُ and تَعَاجِيبُ
and تَبَاشِيرُ [q. v.], none of which four words has
a sing., Pimples that come forth in the face of a
boy or young man, and of a girl or young woman;
as also ↓ نَفَاطِيرُ: thus correctly, with ت and ن:
the author of the K, following Sgh [in the O],
says that ↓ أَفَاطِيرُ is the pl. of ↓ أُفْطُورٌ, and signifies
a cracking, or chapping, in the nose of a young
man, and in his face. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also, thus correctly, with ت, The first of [the herbage of the
rain called] the وَسْمِىّ [q. v.]; and in this sense
also it has no sing.: but it is said in the K that
↓ نَفَاطِيرُ is pl. of ↓ نُفْطُورَةٌ, with ن; [in the O,
that it is pl. of ↓ نُفْطُورٌ;] and [in both] that it
signifies scattered herbage; (TA;) and Lh says,
as is stated by AHn, that مِنْ عُشْبٍ ↓ نَفَاطِيرُ
means small quantities of herbage in land: (O,
TA:) it is also added in the K, in explanation of
↓ نَفَاطِيرُ, or it signifies the first herbage of [the
rain called] the وَسْمِىّ: (TA:) [and it is said
that] تَفَاطِيرُ نَبَاتٍ signifies what break forth of,
or from, plants, or herbage. (TA voce تَبَاشِيرُ.)
مُفْطِرٌ A man breaking his fast; eating and
drinking after fasting: (S, * Msb, * K, TA:) pl.
مَفَاطِيرُ, (Sb, S, Msb, K,) like as مَيَاسِيرُ is pl. of
مُوسِرٌ, (S,) and مَفَالِيسُ of مُفْلِسٌ: (Msb:) and
↓ فِطْرٌ signifies the same, as sing. and pl., (S, Msb,
K,) being originally an inf. n. (S, Msb.)
مُنْفَطِرٌ is used in the Kur [lxxiii. 18], in the
phrase السَّمَآءُ مُنْفَطِرٌ بِهِ [The heaven shall be with
rents by reason of it], in the manner of a
possessive noun, [not as an act. part. n.,] like
مُعْضِلٌ in the phrase دَجَاجَةٌ مُعْضِلٌ. (TA.)
