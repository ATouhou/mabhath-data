فكل8
افتكل فِى فِعْلِهِ i. q. اِحْتَفَلَ [He strove,
laboured, or exerted himself, &c., in his doing];
(IAar, O, K;) said of a man. (IAar, O.)
أَفْكَلُ A tremour, (S, O, K,) from cold or from
fear: (S:) hence, in a trad., أَخَذَنِى أَفْكَلُ [A
tremour seized me]: (S, * O:) and in another,
فَبَاتَ وَلَهُ أَفْكَلُ [And he passed the night having a
tremour, or shivering]: (O:) thus used, as indeterminate, it is perfectly decl.; but if used as a
[proper] name of a man, it is imperfectly decl.
because determinate and also of the measure of a
verb: (S, O:) some say, (IF, O,) no verb is
formed from it; (IF, S, O;) but such is not the
case, for they said رَجُلٌ مَفْكُولٌ [which shows that
it had a verb though none is known to have been
in use]. (IF, O.) [أَخَذَتْ بِى نَاقَتِى أَفْكَلًا مِنَ
السَّيْرِ is a saying mentioned in the O and K, (in
the former as from Ibn-'Abbád,) but the meaning
is not expl., nor indicated by the context, in either
of them; and the strangeness of its phraseology
convinces me that it presents a mistranscription:
I believe that the first word is mistranscribed for
أَحْدَثَتْ, and, consequently, that the meaning is,
My she-camel produced in me a tremour arising
from the rate of journeying: some copies of the
K, as is stated in the TA, for مِنَ السَّيْرِ, have من
السَّبْقِ, from the outstripping.] ―
-b2-  Also The [bird
commonly called] شِقِرَّاق [generally meaning the
green wood-pecker]; (O, K;) because they regard
it as of evil omen; so that when it presents itself
to them, they are frightened at it, and tremble.
(O.)
-A2-  And A company, or collective body, of
men: one says, جَاؤُوا بِأَفْكَلِهِمْ They came with
their company [i. e. all together]. (Ibn-'Abbád, O,
K.) أَفَاكِيلُ [is app. a pl. thereof, and, as such,]
signifies أَفْوَاجٌ [pl. of فَوْجٌ, q. v.]: thus in the
phrase أَفَاكِيلُ مِنْ كَذَا [app. meaning Multitudes of such a kind of thing]: (K:) [or] thus in
the saying, mentioned by Ibn-'Abbád, عِنْدَهُ أَفَاكِيلُ
مِنْ كَلَامٍ [app. meaning He has multitudes of
sayings, or words; for كَلَامٌ (q. v.) is used in a
pl. sense as well as in a sing. sense]. (O. [The
difference of these two exs. in respect of the last
word suggests that there may be in one of them
a mistranscription.])
مَفْكُولٌ [the pass. part. n. of a verb which is not
mentioned,] Affected with a tremour. (IF, O, K,
TA. [See أَفْكَلُ, first sentence.])
