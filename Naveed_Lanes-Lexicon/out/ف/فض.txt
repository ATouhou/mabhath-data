فض1
فَضَّهُ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb,) aor. يَفُضُّ, (S, O,
Msb,) inf. n. فَضٌّ, (S, A, Mgh, O, Msb, K.) He
broke it; namely, the seal (A, Mgh, Msb, K) of
a letter; (A, K;) and any other thing; (TA:)
he broke it asunder, or into several pieces; he
dissundered it; (S, Mgh, O, K;) for instance, the
seal from a letter. (S, O.) فَصَّ الخَاتَمَ is also a
metonymical phrase, meaning (tropical:)  (??): (TA.)
[or rather, i. a.] فَضّ البَكَارَةَ (tropical:)  he destroyed the
virginity: the virginity being likened to a seal,
or this phrase is from فَضَضْتُ اللُّؤْلُؤَةَ I bored, or

meaning May God not break thy teeth, (TA,)
occurs in a trad.: (S, A:) and J says. (TA,)
you should not say ↓ يُفْضِض; (S, TA; [but in
one copy of the S, I find يَفْضِض;]) though some
allow it: and some say that إِفْضَاء [evidently a
mistake for إِفْضَاض] means the falling out of the
teeth from above and below; but the former explanation is the more common. (TA.) ―
-b2-  He
separated it; dispersed it; scattered it; broke it
up; (S, A, Msb, TA;) namely, a thing; (Msb;)

has been mentioned by Sb; but ISd says, I know
not what he meant thereby; whether I took for

افتضّتِ said of a woman, She broke [i. e. ended]
her عِدَّة, (O, K, TA,) meaning a widow's عدّة
[during which she may not marry again, nor use
perfumes &c., and] which is a period of four
months and ten nights, but was before the
Prophet's time a year: (TA:) this she did by
touching perfume, or by some other act, (K, TA,)
such as paring the nail, or plucking out the hair
from the face: (TA:) or she rubbed her body
with [or against] a beast, (K, TA,) i. e. an ass,
or a sheep or goat, (O in art. حفش,) thereby to
quit the state of the عدّة: or it was customary
with them for her to wipe her قُبُل with a bird,
and to throw it away; in consequence of which
it hardly ever, or never, lived: (K, TA:) she
used to enter a حِفْش [or small tent], and wear
the worst of her clothing until a year passed,
when a beast or bird was brought to her, and by
means thereof she broke her عدّة; then she went
forth, and a بَعْرَة [or piece of camel's or similar
dung] was given to her, and she threw it: (TA:
[see 1 in art. بعر:]) she used not to wash herself,
nor to touch water, nor to pare a nail, nor to
pluck out hair from her face; then she would go
forth, after the year, with the foulest aspect, and
break her عدّة by means of a bird, wiping her قُبُل
with it, and throwing it away. (O, TA.) The
verb, thus used, occurs in a trad., but, as some
relate it, with ق and ب [i. e. saying تَقْبِضُ instead of تَفْتَضُّ]; and Az mentions that EshSháfi'ee related this trad. [in like manner] pronouncing the word with ق and ض, from القبض.
