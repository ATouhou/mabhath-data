فغر1
فَغَرَ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.
فَغَرَ (Msb, K)
and
فَغُرَ, (AZ, K,) inf. n. فَغْرٌ (Msb, TA) and فُغُورٌ,
(TA,) He opened his mouth; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;)
as also ↓ افغر. (Zj, Sgh, K.) ―
-b2-  [Also, both verbs,
فَغَرَ and ↓ افغر, He, or it, made, or caused, to open
the mouth. And hence,] فَغَرَ النَّجْمُ, (T, TA,) or
النَّجْمُ ↓ أَفْغَرَ, (S, O,) i. e., الُّرَيَّا, (T, S, O,) The
asterism, meaning the Pleiades, became overhead:
[lit., made one to open his mouth:] (T:) this is in
the winter: (S, O:) for when the Pleiades are in
the midst of the sky, he who looks at them opens
his mouth: (T, S, O:) or the Pleiades began to
rise [after sunset, so as to be overhead in the middle
of the night], in the winter. (TA.)
-A2-  فَغَرَ also
signifies It (the mouth) opened; (S, Mgh, Msb,
K;) as also ↓ انفغر: (K:) and the latter is said
of a blossom, or flower, in the same sense. (S,
Msb, TA.) ―
-b2-  And فَغَرَتِ السِّنُّ (assumed tropical:)  The tooth
showed its point; as though it broke forth to
grow: but some say that its ف is substituted for
ث, and Az inclines to think so [though ثَغَرَ differs
much in meaning from فَغَرَ]. (TA.)
4
أَفْغَرَ and 7: see 1; the former in three places.
هُوَ وَاسِعُ فَغْرِ الفَمِ He is wide in the opening of
the mouth. (Lth, O, K.) ―
-b2-  And accord. to Lth,
(O,) فَغَرٌ signifies also A rose when it opens: (O,
K:) but it is thought by Az to be, in this sense,
a mistake for فَغْوٌ, with و. (O.)
وُلِدَ بِالْفَغْرَةِ He was born at the commencement
of the rising of the Pleiades [after sunset]; (O, K;)
which is in the winter. (TA.) See 1.

is predominant, (TA,) A [certain] دُوَيْبَّة [i. e.

An opening, or a hollow, in a mountain, smaller
than a كَهْف. (K.)
