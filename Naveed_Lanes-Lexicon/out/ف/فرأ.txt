فرأفَرَأْ (T, S, M, O, K) and ↓ فَرَآءٌ, (K,) both of
these forms authorized by the Koofees, (TA,) A
wild ass: (ISk, T, S, M, O, K:) or a youthful
wild ass: (M, K:) but the absolute [i. e. the
former] meaning is that which is commonly
known: (TA:) pl. (of mult., TA) فِرَآءٌ (T, S, M,
O, K) and (of pauc., TA) أَفْرَآءٌ. (M, K.) Hence
the saying, كُلُّ الصَّيدِ فِى جَوْفِ الفَرَا [Every kind
of game is in the belly (or might enter into the
belly) of the wild ass]; (T, S, M, O, K;) meaning that every kind of game is inferior to the
wild ass: (T, O, K:) a prov., (T, S, M, K,) and
therefore [the last word is] without hemz, on
account of the final pause; (K;) but some write
it with hemz: (TA:) it is said to have originated
from the fact that three men went forth to hunt;
and one caught a hare; and another, a gazelle;
and the third, a wild ass; and the first and second
boasted against the third, who thereupon said as
above: it is applied to him who excels his fellows:
(Meyd:) or to a man who is, with respect to
other men, as the wild ass with respect to other
kinds of game: or to the case of a man who,
having several wants, one of which is a great
one, accomplishes that great want, and cares not
for the others' being unaccomplished. (T, TA.
[See also Har pp. 468-9.]) And أَنْكَحْنَا الفَرَا
فَسَنَرَى [We have married our daughter to the
wild ass, and we shall see,] (T, S, M, O) is
another prov.; (T, Meyd;) in which alif is substituted for the hemzeh, (S, M, * O,) for the purpose of the agreement [of الفَرَا in rhyme] with
سَنَرَى: (M:) said by a man to his wife when a
man demanded in marriage his daughter and he
refused, but his wife consented, and overcame the
father so that he gave her in marriage to him
against his wish; then the husband made the
intercourse [with her] to be evil, and divorced
her: it is applied in cautioning against an evil
consequence: (Meyd:) or it is applied to a man
when his affair has been endangered and he has
seen what he does not like; and it means we
have wasted our precaution, and the affair has
brought us to an evil result; (As, T;) or we have
considered the affair, and we shall see what it
will disclose; (T;) or we have sought after high
things, and we shall see what our case will be
afterwards. (Th, M.)
فَرَآءٌ: see above, first sentence.
شَىْءٌ فَرِىْءٌ i. q. فَرِىٌّ [q. v.] (O, K. * See art.
