Q. Q. 1
فَرْوَزَ He died; (IDrd, O, K;) said
of a man: (IDrd, O:) like هَرْوَزَ. (TA.)
فَرْزٌ A depressed tract of land (S, O, K, TA)
between two hills: (TA:) or an intervening space
between two mountains: (TA:) [or] ↓ فُرْزَةٌ has
the latter meaning; mentioned by Ibn-'Abbád. (O.)
فِرْزٌ: see فِرْزَةٌ, in two places: ―
-b2-  and see also
فُرْزَةٌ. ―
-b3-  Accord. to Lth, الفِرْزُ is syn. with الفَرْدُ;
but this is disallowed by Az. (TA.)
فَرْزَةٌ A cleft in rugged ground. (TA.)
فُرْزَةٌ A road in, or upon, an [eminence such as
is termed] أَكَمَة; as also ↓ فِرْزٌ. (Ibn-'Abbád, O,
K.) ―
-b2-  See also فَرْزٌ.
-A2-  Also i. q. فُرْصَةٌ, i. e. نَوْبَةٌ
[meaning A turn; or time at which, or during

'Abbád, O, K.)
فَرْوَازٌ [an arabicized word, from the Pers. پَرْوَاز,
app. as meaning A fringe, or the like; as the
latter word does in Turkish, and probably, sometimes, in Persian]: accord. to some, it is of the
measure فَعْلَالٌ from فَرَزَ in the first of the senses
expl. in this art.; therefore, if so, it is an Arabic
word: the pl. is فَرَاوِزُ. (TA.) See 1, last sentence.
فَارِزٌ A tongue distinct [in utterance]: (O, K,
TA:) and discriminating language. (A, * O, K, *
TA.)
-A2-  Also A species of ant, round and black,
found in dates: so says Ibráheem El-Harbee:
(O and TA in art. عقف:) or the progenitor (جَدّ)
of the black ants: that of the red is termed عُقْفَان:
(K:) but it has been before said by the author of
the K, in art. فزر, that فَازِرٌ signifies “ black ants in
which is a redness: ” and it may be a mistranscription. (TA.)
فَارِزَةٌ A road taking its course in a tract of sand
amid sands that are compact and cleaving to the
ground, and soft, (O, K,) appearing like an
extended natural cleft in the ground: but this is
mentioned in the book of Lth in art. فزر [as
written فَازِرَة]. (O.)
أَفْرَزُ Humpbacked; as also أَفْرَسُ and أَفْرَصُ: so
says Fr. (TA voce أَعْجَرُ.) [The same meaning
is also assigned to أَفْزَرُ, q. v.]
إِفْرِيزٌ, of a wall, an arabicized word, (S, Mgh,
O, K,) [of unknown origin, like our word “ frieze,”
and the French “ frise,” &c., said in the TA to
be from the Pers. پَرْوَاز, mentioned above, voce
فَرْوَازٌ,] A projecting appertenance or roof or covering (جَنَاحٌ) thereof; (Mgh;) the طُنُف [q. v.,
app. meaning a projecting coping, or ledge, or
cornice,] thereof; (O and K in the present art.,
and the same and S in art. طنف;) surrounding
the upper part: (Kr, TA voce زَيْفٌ:) [it is also
expl. as meaning] a hole, or an aperture, in a
wall. (KL. [But this is app. a mistake, caused
by a misunderstanding of the word طَاقٌ, which is
expl. as having this meaning and also as syn. with
إِفْرِيزٌ; and the author of the KL evidently doubted
its correctness, for he adds, “so we have
heard. ”])

مَفْرُوزٌ and ↓ مُفْرَزٌ Put, or set, apart, away, or
aside; removed; or separated: (Mgh:) divided

art. فرس.)
-A3-  ثَوْبٌ مَفْرُوزٌ, (S, O, K,) by some
written مُفَرْوَزٌ, (TA,) is from إِفْرِيزٌ, the افريز of a
wall, (S, TA,) and signifies [A garment, or piece
of cloth,] having تَطَارِيف [app. meaning a fringe,
or fringes; likened to fingers, or the ends of
fingers]. (O, K.) [See 1, last sentence.]
