فدى1
فَدَاهُ, (T, S, M, &c.,) aor. يَفْدِيهِ, (Msb, K,)
inf. n. فِدَآءٌ (T, S, M, Mgh, K,) [omitted in my
copy of the Msb, probably by inadvertence,]) and
فَدًى, (Mgh,) or فِدًى, (so in the M, accord. to
the TT,) or also both of these, (Fr, T, S, Msb,
K,) the latter of them said by Fr, on one occasion, to be the more common, (T, TA,) [which
is the case when it is a subst., like فِدْيَةٌ,] but
'Alee Ibn-Suleymán El-Akhfash [i. e. El-Akhfash
El-Asghar] is related to have said that this is not
allowable except by poetic license, and El-Kálee
says that الفِدَى was used by the Arabs in conjunction with الحِمَى, [see حِمَآءُ, in art. حمى,]
but other forms were used in other cases [among
which he seems to mention فَدَآء, with fet-h and
the lengthened alif, but the words in which I find
this expressed are somewhat ambiguous, and are
also rendered doubtful by an erasure and an
alteration]; (TA;) and ↓ افتداهُ, (M,) [whence
an ex. in a verse which will be found in what
follows,] or بِهِ ↓ افتدى (K, TA) and مِنْهُ, (TA,)
[but I do not know افتدى in either of these
phrases as having any other than the well-known
meaning of فَدَى نَفْسَهُ, which is strangely omitted
in the K;] and know ↓ فادِاهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K, TA,)
inf. n. مُفَادَاةٌ and فِدَآءٌ; (Msb, TA;) but some
explain this differently [as will be shown in what
follows]; (T, Mgh, Msb, TA;) He gave his
ransom; (S;) he gave a thing, (K, TA, [اَعْطاهُ in
the CK being a mistake for أَعْطَى, without the
affixed pronoun,]) or a captive, for him, (TA,)
and so liberated him; (K, TA;) [i. e. he ransomed him;] or he liberated him, or ransomed
him, مِنَ الأَسْرِ [from captivity]: (Mgh, Msb:)
or ↓ فاداهُ signifies he loosed him, or set him free,
and took his ransom: (Mgh, Msb, TA:) or مُفَادَاةٌ
signifies the giving a man and taking a man [in
exchange]: and فِدَآءٌ, [as inf. n. of فَدَاهُ,] the purchasing him [from captivity or the like]: (Mbr,
T, Mgh, Msb, TA:) or the preserving a man
from misfortune by what one gives by way of
compensation for him; as also فَدًى: (Er-Rághib,
TA:) you say, فَدَيْتُهُ بِمَالِى I purchased [i. e. ransomed] him with my property, and بِنَفْسِى with
myself: (T:) or, accord. to Nuseyr Er-Rázee,
the Arabs say, الأَسِيرَ ↓ فَادَيْتُ [I ransomed the
captive], and فَدَيْتُهُ بِأَبِى وَ أُمِى [I ransomed him
in a tropical sense with my father and my mother],
and بِمَالٍ [with property], as though thou purchasedst him and freedst him therewith, when he
was not a captive; and you may say, فَدَيْتُ
الأَسيرَ meaning I freed the captive from the state
in which he was, though ↓ فَادَيْتُ is better in this
sense: as to the reading تَفْدُوهُمْ [in the Kur ii.
79], Aboo-Mo'ádh says, it means Ye purchase
them from the enemy and liberate them; but the
reading ↓ تُفَادُوهُمْ, he says, means ye contend with
them who are in your hands respecting the price
and they so contend with you: (T, TA:) [that
↓ افتداهُ is syn. with فَدَاهُ is shown by what here
follows:] a poet says,
يُفْتَدَى لَفَدَيْتُهُ فَلَوْ كَانَ مَيتٌ
بِمَا لَمْ تَكُنْ عَنْهُ النُّفُوسُ تَطِيبُ
[And if a person dead were to be ransomed,
assuredly I would ransom him with what minds
would not be willing to relinquish]. (M, TA.) ―
-b2-
[The inf. ns. of the first of these verbs are much
used in precative phrases:] they said, فَدًى لَكَ
[for فَدَاكَ فَدًى, and therefore virtually meaning
فُدِيتَ Mayest thou be ransomed; the ل being
لِلتَّبْيِينِ i. e. “ for the purpose of notifying ” the
person addressed]: (TA:) and بِى أَ فَدًى لَكَ [for
فَدَاكَ أَبِى بِنَفْسِهِ فَدًى, and therefore virtually
meaning simply فَدَاكَ أَبِى بِنَفْسِهِ May my father
ransom thee with himself; so that it may be well
rendered may my father be a ransom for thee]:
(S:) and فِدَآء, with tenween, some of the Arabs
pronounce with kesr [to the ء, i. e. they pronounce
فِدَآء with the tenween of kesr], peculiarly when it
is next to [meaning immediately followed by] the
preposition ل, saying فِدَآءٍ لَكَ, because it is indeterminate; they intending thereby the meaning
of a prayer; and As has cited [as an ex. thereof]
the saying of En-Nábighah [Edh-Dhubyánee],
مَهْلًا فِدَآءٍ لَكَ الأَقْوَامُ كُلُّهُمُ
وَمَا أُثَمِرُ مِنْ مَالٍ وَمِنْ وَلَدِ
[Act gently: may the peoples, all of them, and
what I make to be abundant of wealth and of
offspring, give themselves as a ransom, or be a
ransom, for thee: فِدَآءٍ being app. assimilated to
an indeterminate imperative verbal noun such
as صَهٍ in the phrase صَهٍ يَا رَجُلُ, which is as
though one said اُسْكُتْ سُكُوتًا يَا رَجُلُ; thus meaning here لِيَفْدِكَ: but De Sacy mentions, in his
“ Chrest. Arabe,” see. ed., vol. ii., p. 460, three
allowable readings (not the foregoing reading) in
this verse, namely, فدآءٌ and فدآءً and فدآءٍ; and
adds that what here follows is said by a commentator to be, of several explanations, that which is
the right: والقول الآخر وهو الصحيح ان فدآءِ بمعنى
ليُفدِكَ فبناه كما بنى الامر وكذلك تَراكِ و دَراكِ لانه
بمعنى اترك و ادرك: this, it will be observed, is
similar to the explanation which I have offered
of فِدَآءٍ لك; for ليُفدِك is app. a typographical
mistake for ليَفدِك: and I incline to think that
فدآءِ, though supposed to be correct and therefore
likened to تَراكِ and دَراكِ, is a mistake of a copyist
for فدآءٍ; and the more so because I find in Ahlwardt's “ Divans of the Six Ancient Arabic
Poets ” the three readings فِداءٌ and فِداءً and فِداءٍ,
but not فِداءِ]. (S, TA.) ―
-b3-  وَفَدَيْنَاهُ بِذِبْحٍ [in the
Kur xxxvii. 107] means And we made an animal
prepared for sacrifice to be a ransom for him, and
freed him from slaughter. (T, TA.) ―
-b4-  فَدَتْ
نَفْسَهَا مِنْ زَوْجِهَا and ↓ افتدت [alone] mean She
gave property to her husband so that she became
free from him by divorce. (Msb, TA.) ―
-b5-  See
also what next follows.
2
فدّاهُ, (S, * K,) or فدّاهُ بِنَفْسِهِ, (S, * TA,) [or
both, for both are correct,] inf. n. تَفْدِيَةٌ; (S, K;)
and بنفسه ↓ فَدَاهُ, (S, TA, *) aor. يَفْدِيهِ, inf. n. فِدَآءٌ;
(TA;) He said to him ↓ فِدَاكَ جُعِلْتُ [May I be
made thy ransom, i. e. a ransom for thee]. (S,
K, TA.)

فَاْدَىَ see 1, former half, in five places. ―
-b2-  In the
saying respecting bloodwits, وَإِنْ أَحَبُّوا فَادَوْا, the
meaning is, [And if they like,] they free the slayer,
or his next of kin who is answerable for him, and
accept the bloodwit; because this is a substitute
for the blood, like as the ransom is a substitute
for the captive. (Mgh.)
4
افداهُ الأَسِيرَ [in the CK (erroneously) الاسيرُ]
He accepted from him the ransom of the captive.
(M, K.) Hence the saying of the Prophet to
Kureysh, when 'Othmán Ibn-'Abd-Allah and El-
Hakam Ibn-Keysán had been made captives, لَا
نُفْدِيكُمُو هُمَا حتَّى يَقْدَمَ صَاحِبَانَا [We will not accept
from you the ransom of them two until our two
companions shall come], meaning [by the two
companions] Saad Ibn-Abee-Wakkás and 'Otbeh
Ibn-Ghazwán. (M.) ―
-b2-  افدى فُلَانٌ Such a one
danced, or dandled, his child: (K, TA:) because
of his [often] saying, فَدِى لَكَ أَبِى وَ أُمِى [May my
father and my mother be ransoms for thee].
(TA.)
-A2-  افدى also signifies He made for his
dried dates a store-chamber. (K.) ―
-b2-  And (assumed tropical:)  He
became large in his body; (IAar, T, K, TA;) as
though it became like the فَدَآء [q. v.]. (TA.) ―
-b3-
And He sold dates. (IAar, T, K.)
6
تفادوا They ransomed one another. (S, TA.)
―
-b2-  And (assumed tropical:)  They guarded themselves, one by another;
as though every one of them made his fellow to
be his ransom. (Msb, TA.) ―
-b3-  And تفادى مِنْهُ
(tropical:)  He guarded against it, or was cautious of it,
and kept aloof from it. (S, K, * TA.)

إِفْتَدَىَ see 1, first quarter, in two places; and
again, near the middle of the paragraph. ―
-b2-  As
intrans., افتدى signifies [He ransomed himself;]
he gave a ransom for himself. (Er-Rághib, TA.)
You say, افتدى مِنْهُ بِكَذَا [He ransomed himself
from him with such a thing]. (S.) Hence the
usage of the verb in the Kur ii. 229. (TA.) See
1, last sentence but one.
فَدًى and ↓ فِدًى and ↓ فِدَآءٌ and ↓ فِدْيَةٌ all signify the same, (S, K,) i. e. [A ransom;] a thing,
(K, TA,) or a captive, (TA,) that is given for a
man, who is therewith liberated: (K, TA:) [the
first three are also inf. ns. (and have been mentioned as such in the first paragraph); therefore
when you say فَدًى لَكَ أَبِى and فِدًى لك ابى, the
words فَدًى and فِدًى may be either inf. ns. or
substs.: as substs., the second and third are more
common than the first:] فِدْيَةً [is also sometimes
expl. as an inf. n., but accord. to general usage]
signifies as above; (K, TA;) or property given
as a substitute [or a ransom] for a captive: (Mgh,
Msb, TA:) and property by the giving of which
one preserves himself from evil in the case of a
religious act in which he has fallen short of what
was incumbent, like the expiation for the breaking
of an oath and of a fast; and thus it is used in
the Kur ii. 180 and 192: (Er-Rághib, TA:) and
its pl. is فِدًى and فِدَيَاتٌ. (Mgh, Msb, TA.)
فِدًى: see the next preceding paragraph. [Hence
the phrase] جُعِلْتُ فِدَاكَ: see 2. It is also a pl.
of its syn. فِدْيَةً. (Mgh, Msb, TA.)
فِدْيَةٌ: see فَدًى.
-A2-  خُذْ عَلَى هِدْيَتِكَ وَ فِدْيَتِكَ,
accord. to the K, but in the S, خُذْ فِى هِدْيَتِكَ
وَقِدْيَتِكَ, mentioned in art. قدى, is a saying
meaning [Take thou to] that [course] in which
thou wast: the author of the K seems to have
followed Sgh, who has mentioned it here: (TA
in the present art.:) فِدْيَهٌ and قِدْيَهٌ are dial. vars.
(TA in art. قدى.)
فَدَآءٌ An أَنْبَار, (K, TA,) i. e. (TA) a collection,
of wheat: (M, K, * TA:) or it signifies, (K,) or
signifies also, (M,) a collection of food, consisting
of barley and dates and the like: (M, K:) or an
أَنْبَار, i. e. a collection, of food, consisting of wheat
and dates and barley: (S:) and it is said to signify a place in which dates are spread and dried,
in the dial. of 'Abd-El-Keys. (M.) ―
-b2-  And The
حَجْم [or protuberant, or prominent, part, or
perhaps the bulk,] of a thing (M, K) of any
kind. (M.)
فِدَآئٌ: see فَدًى.
الفِدَاوِيَّةُ is the appellation of A class, or rect,
of the خَوَارِج of the دُرْزِيَّة [or دُرُوز, whom we call
the Druses; it is a coll. gen. n., of which the
n. un. is فِدَاوِىُّ; the و being a substitute for ء:
it is used to signify those who undertake perilous
adventures, more particularly for the destruction
of enemies of their party; as though they offered
themselves as ransoms or victims; and hence it is
applied to the sect called in our histories of the
Crusades “ The Assassins ”]. (TA.)
[
مَفْدِىٌّ, originally مَفْدُوىٌ. In the saying بِنَفْسِى
فُلَانٌ مُفْدِىٌّ With my soul, or myself, may such a
one be ransomed, مَفْدِىٌّ is often suppressed; being
meant to be understood.]
