فمفَمٌ The mouth: (MA, KL, &c.:) it is originally
فَوَهٌ, (S, K, and Msb in art. فوه,) with two fet-hahs,
(Msb in that art.,) or فَوْهٌ; (so in some copies of
the S;) the ه being cut off from it, the و is not
susceptible of declension, because it is quiescent,
therefore م is substituted for it; but when you
form the dim. or the pl., you restore it to its original state, saying [in the former case] فُوَيْهٌ and
[in the latter case] أَفْوَاهٌ, and not أَفْمَآءٌ [in some of
the copies of the S not أَفْمَامٌ]: but when you form
the rel. n., you say ↓ فَمِىٌّ; and, if you will,
↓ فَمَوِىٌّ, combining the substitute and the letter
for which it is substituted, like as they say in the
dual فَمَوَانِ; this being held to be allowable
because of there being therein another letter rejected, i. e. the ه, as though they made the م in
this case to be a substitute for the ه, not for the
و: (S, TA:) and one says also فَمَيَانِ, which,
like فَمَوَانِ, is anomalous; (IAar, K in art. فوه;)
but one says فَمَانِ also, as well as فَمَوَانِ: (Msb
in art. فوه:) it has three forms, فَمٌ and فُمٌ and فِمٌ:
(S, K, TA:) and some decline it doubly; saying
in the nom. case فُمٌ, accus. فَمًا, and gen. فِمٍ; (S,
TA;) like اِمْرُؤٌ and اِبْنُمٌ, which have been said to
be the only other instances of the kind: (TA:)
when it is prefixed to the [pronominal] ى, one
says فِىَّ and فَمِى: but when to [a pronoun] other
than the ى, it is declined with the letters و and ا
and ى, so that one says فُوُهُ and فَاهُ and فِيهِ; but
one also says فَمُهُ: (Msb. in art. فوه:) and sometimes the م is musheddedeh, (S, K,) in poetry,
as in the saying, (S, TA,) of Mohammad Ibn-Dhu-eyb El-'Ománee El-Fukeymee, the rájiz,
(TA in this art. and in art. طسم,) addressing
Er-Rasheed, or, accord. to IKh, said in relation
to Suleymán Ibn-'Abd-El-Melik and 'Abd-El-
'Azeez. (TA in art. طسم,)
يَا لَيْتَهَا قَدْ خَرَجَتْ مِنْ فُمِّهِ
حَتَّى يَعُودَ المُلْكُ فِى أُسْطُمِّهِ
(S, TA) or أُطْسُمِّهِ i. e. [O, would that it had gone
forth from his mouth, so that the dominion might
return] to its rightful owner; (S in art. سطم, and
TA in art. طسم;) and it would have been allowable, (S, TA,) accord. to ISk, (S,) or accord. to
Fr, (TA,) if he had said ↓ من فَمِّهِ, with fet-h to
the ف: (S, TA:) the pl. of فم, with teshdeed, is
أَفْمَامٌ; and its dim. is ↓ فُمَيْمٌ, mentioned by Lh.
(TA.) MF says that many of the expositors of
the Tes-heel have collected the dial. vars. of this
word, compounded and uncompounded, and they
have exceeded twenty; that with fet-h, they say,
being the most common and the most chaste.
(TA.) [See more in art. فوه.] ―
-b2-  [Hence,] الفم
is metonymically applied to (tropical:)  The teeth. (Ham
p. 242.) ―
-b3-  [Hence also,] فَمُ الحُوتِ (assumed tropical:)  The star
[a] in the mouth of Piscis Australis. (Kzw &c.:
see art. حوت.) And فَمُ الفَرَسِ (assumed tropical:)  The star [e] upon
the lip of Pegasus. (Kzw.) ―
-b4-  [And فَمُالرَّحِمِ
(assumed tropical:)  The mouth of the womb.] ―
-b5-  And فَمُ النَّهْرِ (assumed tropical:)  The
mouth of the river. (MA.) ―
-b6-  And [hence likewise,] فَمٌ is also used as meaning (assumed tropical:) Branch;
opposed to اِسْتٌ meaning “ root. ” (TA in art.
سته; in which see اِسْتٌ, last quarter.)
-A2-  فَمٌ مِنَ
الدِّبَاغِ means The quantity that is used at one
time, of tan; (Fr, K, * TA;) like نَفْسٌ مِنْهُ. (Fr,
TA.)
فَمِىٌّ and فَمَوِىٌّ: see the preceding paragraph,
near the beginning.
فُمَّ a dial. var. of the conjunction تُمَّ [q. v.]:
(K:) or the ف in the former is a substitute for
the ث in the latter: one says, رَأَيْتُ عَمْرًا فُمَّ زَيْدًا
and ثُمَّ زَيْدًا, both meaning the same [i. e. I saw
'Amr: then Zeyd]: (TA:) and in like manner
one says فُمَّتَ and فُمَّتْ, meaning تُمَّتَ and تُمَّتْ.
(M and TA voce ثُمَّ.)
فُمٌّ and فَمٌّ: see the first paragraph, latter half.
فُمَيْمٌ: see the first paragraph, latter half.
