فalphabetical letter
ف
The twentieth letter of the alphabet: called فَآءٌ
[and فَا]. (TA.) It is one of the letters termed
مَهْمُوسَة [or non-vocal, i. e. pronounced with the
breath only, without the voice], and of those
termed شَفَوِيَّة [or labial]: (TA:) it is a radical
letter, and not augmentative: (TA in باب الالف
الليّنة:) sometimes it is substituted for ث; thus
in the conjunction ثُمَّ, as in the saying جَآءَ زَيْدٌ فُمَّ
عَمْرٌو [“ Zeyd came, then 'Amr ”]; and in الثُّومُ,
“ the well-known herb so called [?],” for which they
say الفُومُ; and in الجَدَثُ, “the grave,” or
“ sepulchre,” for which they say الجَدَفُ, but
using for the pl. أَجْدَاثٌ, and not أَجْدَافٌ, accord.
to IJ, (MF, TA,) [unless, app., by poetic
license, for] the latter pl. is used by Ru-beh. (R
and TA in art. جدف.)
-A2-  فَ is a particle having
no government: (Mughnee, * K, * TA:) or it
governs a mansoob aor.; as in the saying, مَا
تَأْتِينَا فَتُحَدِّثَنَا [Thou dost not come to us, that thou
mayest talk to us]; (Mughnee, K, TA;) accord.
to some of the Koofees; (Mughnee;) but the
truth is, that the aor. is here mansoob by أَنْ,
meant to be understood, (Mughnee, TA,) as is
said by MF, and the like is said by J, (TA,)
though the أَنْ in this case is necessarily suppressed: (I'Ak p. 295:) and it is said (Mughnee,
K, TA) by Mbr (Mughnee) to govern the gen.
case in the saying [of Imra-el-Keys],
فَمِثْلِكِ حُبْلَى قَدْ طَرَقْتُ وَمُرْضِعٍ
[Many a one like thee, even such as was pregnant, have I visited by night, and such as was
suckling]; but the truth is, that what here
governs the gen. case is رُبَّ, meant to be understood; (Mughnee, TA;) like as it often is in the
case of وَ, as is said in the Lubáb. (TA.) ―
-b2-  It
occurs used in three manners; in one whereof it
is an adjunctive to an antecedent, and denotes
three things: ―
-b3-  one of these is order; and this
is of two sorts; relating to the meaning, as in
قَامَ زَيْدٌ فَعَمْرٌو [Zeyd came, and after him 'Amr];
and relating to a verbal statement, which is an
adjoining of an explicit clause to an implicit
antecedent, as in the saying [in the Kur ii. 34]
فَأَزَلَّهُمَا الشَّيْطَانُ عَنْهَا فَأَخْرَجَهُمَا مِمَّا كَانَا فِيهِ [And
the Devil caused them both to slip, or fall, from
it (i. e. from Paradise), and ejected them from
that state of enjoyment in which they were]:
(Mughnee, K: *) ―
-b4-  the second thing that it
denotes when used as an adjunctive to an antecedent is proximate sequence, and this is in
everything [i. e. in every case] according to the
estimate thereof; (Mughnee, K; *) [meaning,
according to the relative, or comparative, estimate of the time implied; for, as is said in an
explanation of the words thus rendered, in a
marginal note in my copy of the Mughnee, “the
long period is sometimes esteemed short by comparison; ” or it may be defined as a particle denoting sequence in a case in which is an uninterrupted connection between two events;] one says
تَزَوَّجَ فُلَانٌ فَوُلِدَ لَهُ [Such a one took a wife, and,
in uninterrupted connection with his doing so, a
child was born to him,] when there did not intervene between the two events aught save the
period of gestation, (Mughnee, K, *) and so if it
were a period protracted [beyond the usual
length]; and you say دَخَلْتُ البَصْرَةَ فَبَغْدَادَ [I
entered El-Basrah, and, in uninterrupted connection with my doing so, Baghdád,] when you
did not stay in El-Basrah nor between the two
towns: and this sequence is not necessarily implied by the ف that denotes causality; as is
shown by the correctness of one's saying إِنْ
يُسْلِمْ فَهُوَ يَدْخُلُ الجَنَّةَ [If he become a Muslim,
he will consequently enter Paradise]; the delay
between the two events [by death &c.] being well
known: (Mughnee:) ―
-b5-  [or, accord. to J,] the
adjunctive ف occurs in three cases, in the first of
which it denotes order and proximate sequence
with association; you say, ضَرَبْتُ زَيْدًا فَعَمْرًا [I
beat Zeyd, and next 'Amr]: (S: [the second and
third of these cases will be mentioned in the
course of this art:]) ―
-b6-  and it is said to occur
sometimes in the sense of ثُمَّ, (Mughnee, K, *
TA, *) denoting conjunction in an absolute manner,
with delay; (TA;) as in the saying [in the Kur
xxiii. 14] ثُمَّ خَلَقْنَا النُّطْفَةَ عَلَقَةً فَخَلَقْنَا الْعَلَقَةَ مُضْغَةً
فَخَلَقْنَا الْمُضْغَةَ عِظَامًا فَكَسَوْنَا الْعِظَامَ لَحْمًا [Then
we made the sperm a lump of clotted blood, then
we made the lump of clotted blood a bit of flesh,
then we made the bit of flesh bones, then we
clothed the bones with flesh]: (Mughnee, K,
TA:) ―
-b7-  and sometimes in the sense of وَ,
(Mughnee, K, * TA, *) denoting conjunction in an
absolute manner, without order; (TA;) as in
the saying (of Imra-el-Keys, TA), بَيْنَ الدَّخُولِ
فَحَوْمَلِ [as though meaning Between Ed-Dakhool and Howmal]; (Mughnee, K, TA;) the
right reading of which is asserted by As to be
with وَ; but it is replied that the implied meaning is بَيْنَ مَوَاضِعِ الدَّخُولِ فَمَوَاضِعِ حَوْمَلِ [amidst
the places of, or pertaining to, Ed-Dakhool, and
the places of, or pertaining to, Howmal; the
former places and the latter being contiguous;
and we may therefore understand these words as
relating to an antecedent command to pause];
this phrase being allowable like the saying
جَلَسْتُ بَيْنَ العُلَمَآءِ فَالزُّهَّادِ [I sat amidst the
learned men and the devotees]: it has been said
that مَا is here suppressed before بَيْنَ, and that
فَ is used in the place of إِلَى; but this usage of
فَ is strange: (Mughnee:) ―
-b8-  the third thing
that it denotes when used as an adjunctive to
an antecedent is relation to a cause: (Mughnee,
K, * TA: *) this is the second of the three
cases mentioned by J, who says, (TA,) it is
when what precedes it is a cause of what follows
it; and it denotes adjunction and proximate
sequence without association; as in the sayings
ضَرَبَهُ فَبَكَى [He beat him, and he consequently
wept,] and ضَرَبَهُ فَأَوْجَعَهُ [He beat him, and consequently pained him,] when the beating is the
cause of the weeping and of the pain: (S, TA:)
used in this manner, i. e. to denote relation to a
cause, it is generally such as adjoins a proposition, as in [the saying in the Kur xxviii. 14]
فَوَكَزَهُ مُوسَى فَقَضَى عَلَيْهِ [And Moses struck him
with his fist, and consequently killed him]; or a
qualificative, as in [the saying in the Kur lvi.
52-54] لَآكِلُونَ مِنْ شَجَرٍ مِنْ زَقُّومٍ فَمَالِئُونَ مِنْهَا
الْبُطُونَ فَشَارِبُونَ عَلَيْهِ مِنَ الْحَمِيمِ [Shall surely be
eating from trees of Zakkoom, and consequently
filling therefrom the bellies, and drinking thereon
of hot water]. (Mughnee, K.) ―
-b9-  Another manner in which it is used [the second of the three
manners before mentioned (Mughnee)] is as a
connective of an apodosis, i. e., of the complement of a conditional clause, (Mughnee, * K, *
TA,) when this is of a kind not fit to be itself
conditional, i. e., to be a protasis. (Mughnee.)
It is thus used when the complement is a
nominal proposition; as in [the saying in the
Kur vi. 17] وَإِنْ يَمْسَسْكَ بِخَيْرٍ فَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ
قَدِيرٌ [And if He cause good to betide thee, He is
able to do everything]: (Mughnee, K, TA:) this
is the third of the three cases mentioned by J,
who says, (TA,) this is when it is used for the
purpose of inception, in the complement of a
conditional clause; as in the saying إِنْ تَزُرْنِى
فَأَنْتَ مُحْسِنٌ [If thou visit me, thou wilt be a
welldoer]; in which what follows فَ is a new
proposition, grammatically independent of what
precedes it, one part thereof governing another;
for أَنْتَ is an inchoative, and مُحْسِنٌ is its enunciative; and the proposition has become a complement by means of the ف: (S, TA:) ―
-b10-  or,
(K,) secondly, (Mughnee,) the complement may
be a verbal proposition, like the nominal, and it
is one of which the verb is aplastic; as in [the
saying in the Kur xviii. 37 and 38] إِنْ تَرَنِ أَنَا
أَقَلَّ مِنْكَ مَالًا وَوَلَدًا فَعَسَى رَبِّى أَنْ يُؤْتِيَنِ [If thou
seest me to be possessing less than thou in respect
of wealth and children, it may be that my Lord
may give me]; and [the saying in the Kur ii.
273] إِنْ تُبْدُوا الصَّدَقَاتِ فَنِعِمَّا هِىَ [If ye make
apparent the alms, very good, as a thing, is it,
i. e. the doing so]: (Mughnee, K:) ―
-b11-  or, (K,)
thirdly, (Mughnee,) the verb of the complement
may be one belonging to a new proposition,
grammatically independent of what precedes it,
as in [the saying in the Kur iii. 29] إِنْ كُنْتُمْ
تُحِبُّونَ اللّٰهَ فَاتَّبِعُونِى [If ye love God, follow
ye me]: (Mughnee, K:) ―
-b12-  or, (K,) fourthly,
(Mughnee,) the verb of the complement may be
a pret., as to the letter and as to the meaning;
either properly, as in [the saying in the Kur
xii. 77] إِنْ يَسْرِقْ فَقَدْ سَرَقَ أَخٌ لَهُ مِنْ قَبْلُ [If he
steal, a brother of his hath stolen before]: or
tropically, as in [the saying in the Kur xxvii. 92]
وَمَنْ جَآءَ بِالسَّيِّئَةِ فَكُبَّتْ وُجُوهُمُمْ فِى النَّارِ [And
whoever shall have done that which is evil, their
faces are inverted in the fire of Hell], this [latter]
verb being used as though signifying what has
already happened to denote the certain assurance
of the event's happening: (Mughnee, K: *) ―
-b13-
fifthly, when the ف is coupled with a particle relating to futurity; as in [the saying in the Kur
v. 59] مَنْ يَرْتَدَّ مِنْكُمْ عَنْ دِينِهِ فَسَوْفَ يَأْتِى اللّٰهُ
بِقَوْمٍ يُحِبُّهُمْ [Whoever of you revolteth from his
religion, God will bring a people whom He
loveth]; and in [the saying in the Kur iii. 111]
وًمَا تَفْعَلُوا مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَلَنْ تُكْفَرُوهُ [And what ye do
of good, ye shall not be denied the reward of it]:
(Mughnee: omitted in the K; as is also what
here next follows:) ―
-b14-  sixthly, when the ف is
coupled with a particle to which is peculiarly
assigned the first place in a proposition, as in the
saying,
فَإِنْ أَهْلِكْ فَذِى حَنَقٍ لَظَاهُ
عَلَىَّ يَكَادُ يَلْتَهِبُ الْتِهَابَا
[a verse similar in itself, and probably in its
sequel (which is not quoted), to one by Rabee'ah
Ibn-Makroom (in Ham p. 29), app. meaning
And if I perish, many a one having rage in his
bosom, whose fire kindled against me almost
flames with a vehement flaming; فَذِى حَنَقٍ being for فَرُبَّ ذِى حَنَقٍ]; for رُبَّ is meant to be
understood, and to it peculiarly belongs the first
place in the proposition: (Mughnee:) ―
-b15-  the ف
must also be used when the complement of a
conditional clause is imperative; as in the saying
إِنْ أَكْرَمَكَ زَيْدٌ فَأَكْرِمْهُ [If Zeyd treat thee with
honour, treat thou him with honour]: or prohibitive; as in the saying إِنْ يُكْرِمْكَ زَيْدٌ فَلَا تُهِنْهُ [If
Zeyd treat thee with honour, treat not thou him
with contempt]: or negative, either by means of
لَنْ [as in an ex. above] or by means of مَا; as in the
saying إِنْ أَكْرَمْتَ زَيْدًا فَمَا يَهِينُكَ [If thou treat
Zeyd with honour, he does not treat thee with contempt]: (TA:) ―
-b16-  when the verb of that complement is an aor., affirmative, or negative by
means of لَا, the ف may be introduced or
omitted: in the former case you may say إِنْ
تُكْرِمْنِى فَأُكْرِمُكَ meaning فَأَنَا أُكْرِمُكَ [i. e. If thou
treat me with honour, I will treat thee with
honour]; and you may say إِنْ تُكْرِمْنِى أُكْرِمْكَ
[which is the more usual] if you do not make it
[i. e. اكرمك] the enunciative of a suppressed inchoative [i. e. of أَنَا]: and in the case of the
negative by means of لا you may say إِنْ تُكْرِمْنِى
فَلَا أُهِينُكَ [If thou treat me with honour, I will
not treat thee with contempt; and you may omit
the ف as is more usual]: (TA:) ―
-b17-  and sometimes the ف is suppressed in the case of necessity
in verse [on account of the metre]; as in the
saying,
مَنْ يَفْعَلِ الْحَسَنَاتِ اللّٰهُ يَشْكُرُهَا
[Whoso doth those deeds that are good, God will
recompense them, i. e., the deeds], (Mughnee,
K,) meaning فَاللّٰهُ: (K:) or, (Mughnee, K,)
accord. to Mbr, who disallows this even in verse,
(Mughnee,) the right reading is
مَنْ يَفْعَلِ الخَيْرَ فَالرَّحْمٰنُ يَشْكُرُهُ
[Whoso doth that which is good, the Compassionate
will recompense it]; (Mughnee, K;) and it is
absolutely disallowable: (K:) or it occurs in
chaste prose, (Mughnee, K, *) accord. to Akh;
(Mughnee;) and hence the saying [in the Kur
ii. 176] إِنْ تَرَكَ خَيْرًا الْوَصِيَّةُ لِلْوَالِدَيْنِ وَالْأَقْرَبِينَ
[If he leave wealth, the legacy shall be to the two
parents and the nearer of other relations]; and
the trad. respecting that which one has picked
up, or taken, of property that has been dropped,
فَإِنْ جَآءَ صَاحِبُهَا وَإِلَّا اسْتَمْتِعْ بِهَا [And if the owner
thereof come, restore thou it to him; and if not,
or otherwise, benefit thyself by it]: (Mughnee,
K:) ―
-b18-  when the verb of the complement of a
conditional clause is a pret. as to the letter but
future as to the meaning intended [yet not importing certainty, so that it is not like the saying in
the Kur xxvii. 92, cited above], the ف may not
be prefixed to it; as in the saying إِنْ أَكْرَمْتَنِى
أَكْرَمْتُكَ [If thou treat me with honour, I will
treat thee with honour]: and likewise when it is
pret. as to the [proper] signification but [an aor.
as to the letter and] future as to the meaning intended; as in the saying إِنْ أَسْلَمْتَ لَمْ تَدْخُلِ النَّارَ
[If thou become a Muslim, thou wilt not enter the
fire of Hell]. (TA.) ―
-b19-  And as the ف thus connects the apodosis with its protasis, so it connects the like of the apodosis with the like of the
protasis; as in the saying اَلَّذِى يَأْتِينِى فَلَهُ دِرْهَمٌ
[Who comes, or shall come, to me, for him is, or
shall be, a dirhem]: by its being introduced in
this case, one understands what the speaker
means, that the obligation to give the dirhem is
a consequence of the coming: otherwise the saying would be ambiguous. (Mughnee.) Thus also
it occurs after a clause commencing with the conditional particle أَمَّا, q. v. (Mughnee in art. أَمَّا;
&c.) ―
-b20-  It also occurs in the cases here following,
prefixed to an aor., which is mansoob by means
of أَنْ, meant to be understood, (S, TA, and I'Ak
p. 295,) but necessarily suppressed: (I'Ak ibid.:)
―
-b21-  thus in the complement of a command; (S,
TA, and I'Ak p. 296;) as in اِئْتَنِى فَأُكْرِمَكَ
[Come thou to me, that I may treat thee with
honour]: (I'Ak ibid.:) [and] you say زُرْنِى
فَأُحْسِنَ إِلَيْكَ [Visit thou me, that I may do good
to thee]; (S, TA;) to which J adds, you do not
make the visiting to be the cause of the doing
good; what you [would] say being, it is of my
way to do good always; but [there seems be an
omission here in the copies of the S, for, as] IB
says, if you make أُحْسِن to be marfooa, [not
mansoob,] saying فَأُحْسِنُ إِلَيْكَ, [the meaning is,
for I will do good to thee, for] you do not make
the visiting to be the cause of the doing good:
(TA:) the demand, however, in this and similar
cases, must not be indicated by a verbal noun,
nor by an enunciative; for when it is so indicated, the aor. must be marfooa; as in صَهْ
فَأُحْسِنُ إِلَيْكَ [Be silent, then I will do thee good];
and in حَسْبُكَ الحَدِيثُ فَيَنَامُ النَّاسُ [The discourse
is sufficient for thee, so the people shall sleep]:
(I'Ak p. 296:) ―
-b22-  also in the complement of a
prohibition; (S, and I'Ak p. 296;) as in لَا تَضْرِبْ
زَيْدًا فَيَضْرِبَكَ [Beat not thou Zeyd, for he may
beat thee, or lest he beat thee]: (I'Ak ibid.:) ―
-b23-
and in the complement of a prayer; as in رَبِّ
انْصُرْنِى فَلَا أُخْذَلَ [My Lord aid me, so that I
may not be left helpless]: (I'Ak ibid.:) ―
-b24-  and in
the complement of an interrogation; (S, and
I'Ak p. 296;) as in هَلْ تُكْرِمُ زَيْدًا فَيُكْرِمَكَ [Wilt
thou treat Zeyd with honour, that he may treat
thee with honour?]: (I'Ak ibid.:) ―
-b25-  and in the
complement of a petition with gentleness; (S,
and I'Ak p. 296;) as in أَلَا تَنْزِلُ عِنْدَنَا فَتُصِيبَ
خَيْرًا [Wilt thou not alight at our place of abode,
that thou mayest obtain good?]: (I'Ak ibid.:)
―
-b26-  and in the complement of a demanding with
urgency the performance of an action; as in لَوْلَا
تَأْتِينَا فَتُحَدِّثَنَا [Wherefore dost thou not come to
us, that thou mayest talk to us?]: (I'Ak p. 296:)
―
-b27-  and in the complement of an expression of
wish; as in لَيْتَ لِى مَالًا فَأَتَصَدَّقَ مِنْهُ [Would
that I had wealth, that I might give alms thereof]: (I'Ak ibid.:) ―
-b28-  and in the complement of
an expression of hope, in like manner as in the
case next before mentioned, accord. to the Koofees
universally; as in the saying in the Kur [xl. 38
and 39] لَعَلِّى أَبْلُغُ الْأَسْبَابَ أَسْبَابَ السَّمٰوَاتِ فَأَطَّلِعَ
[May-be I shall reach the tracts, or the gates,
the tracts, or the gates, of the heavens, so that I
may look], accord. to one reading: (I'Ak p.
298:) ―
-b29-  and in the complement of a negation,
(S, and I'Ak p. 295,) i. e., of a simple negation;
as in مَا تَأْتِينَا فَتُحَدِّثَنَا [Thou dost not come to us,
that thou mayest talk to us; a saying mentioned
before, in the first of the remarks on this
particle]. (I'Ak ibid.) ―
-b30-  It is also prefixed as a
corroborative to an oath; as in فَبِعِزَّتِكَ [which
may be rendered Now by thy might, or nobility,
&c.], and فَوَرَبِّكَ [Now by thy Lord]. (TA.) ―
-b31-
The third manner in which it is [said to be]
used is when it is redundant, so that its being
included in a saying is like its being excluded:
but this usage is not affirmed by Sb: Akh allows
its being redundant in the enchoative, absolutely;
mentioning the phrase أَخُوكَ فَوُجِدَ [as though
meaning Thy brother, he has been found; but
هٰذَا is app. meant to be understood, so that the
phrase should be rendered, fully, this is thy
brother, and he has been found]: Fr and ElAalam and a number of others restrict its being
allowable to the cases in which the enunciative
is a command, as in the saying,
وَقَائِلَةٍ خَوْلَانُ فَانْكِحْ فَتَاتَهُمْ
and in the saying,
أَنْتَ فَانْظُرْ لِأَىِّ ذَاكَ تَصِيرُ
or a prohibition, as in the saying زَيْدٌ فَلَا تَضْرِبْةُ;
but those who disallow its being so explain the
first of these three exs. by saying that the implied
meaning is هٰذِهِ خَوْلَانُ, [so that the saying
should be rendered, fully, Many a woman is
there saying, This is Khowlán (the tribe so named),
therefore marry thou their young woman; and in
like manner the implied meaning of the third ex.
is هٰذَا زَيْدٌ فَلَا تَضْرِبْهُ This is Zeyd, therefore do
not thou beat him;] and the implied meaning of
the second ex. is اُنْظُرْ فَانْظُرْ, [so that the saying
should be rendered, fully, Look thou, and look to
what result thereof thou wilt eventually come,]
the former انظر being suppressed, and its implied
pronoun, أَنْتَ, expressed: the saying
وَإِذَا هَلَكْتُ فَعِنْدَ ذٰلِكَ فَاجْزَعِى
[meaning And when I perish, on the occasion
thereof manifest thou impatience, or grief, &c.,
the second ف being redundant,] is an instance
of poetic license. (Mughnee.)
-A3-  [As a numeral,
ف denotes Eighty.]
