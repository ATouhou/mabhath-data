فزع1
فَزِعَ, (S, O, Msb, K,) and فَزَعَ, (K,) aor.
فَزَعَ,
of the former verb, (Msb, K,) and of the latter
also, (K,) inf. n. فَزَعٌ, (S, O, Msb, K,) which is
of the former verb, (S, * O, Msb, TA,) and [of
the latter verb] فَزْعٌ [فَزَعًا in the CK being a mistake for فَزْعًا] and ?? (K, TA,) He feared; or
was, or became, in fear, afraid, frightened, or terrified; (S, O, Msb, K, TA;) and so ↓ تفزّع: (TA
in art. روع:) you say, فَزِعَ مِنْهُ he feared him, or
it; or was, or became, in fear, &c., of him, or it:
(MA, Msb, TA:) accord. to Er-Rághib, فَزَعٌ signifies a shrinking, and an aversion, that comes
upon a man, from a thing causing fear or fright;
and is a kind of جَزَع [q. v.]; and one should not
say فَزِعْتُ مِنَ اللّٰهِ like as one says خِفْتُ مِنْهُ: or,
as Mbr says, in the “ Kámil,” its primary signification is the fearing, or being in fear or afraid
or frightened or terrified: then, by a metonymical
application, it signifies a people's going forth
quickly to repel an enemy, or the like, that has
come upon them suddenly; and this meaning has
become [conventionally regarded as] proper.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  فَزَعٌ signifies also The seeking, or demanding, aid, or succour: (Az, K, TA:) and the
aiding, or succouring; (Az, S, O, K, TA;) this
latter being likewise a signification of ↓ إِفْزَاعٌ: (S,
O:) an ex. of the former word (S, O, TA) in the
latter sense (O, TA) occurs in the saying of the
Prophet to the Ansár, إِنَّكُمْ لَتَكْثُرُونَ عِنْدَ الفَزَعِ
وَ تَقِلُّونَ عِنْدَ الطَّمَعِ [Verily ye are many on the
occasion of aiding, or succouring, and ye are few
on the occasion of coveting, or greed]; (S, O, TA;)
or in this saying the implied meaning may be, on
the occasion of men's betaking themselves to you in
fear (عِنْدَ فَزَعِ النَّاسِ إِلَيْكُمْ) in order that ye may
aid or succour them [which is virtually the same
as their seeking your aid or succour]: (TA:) thus
[it is said] فَزَعٌ has two contr. significations: (K:)
and both of these significations are expressed by
the verb فَزِعَ: (O:) you say فَزِعَ إِلَيْهِ and فَزِعَ
مِنْهُ; (K in continuation of what has been last
cited therefrom above, and TA; [app. meant to
indicate that both of these phrases signify he
sought, or demanded, aid, or succour, of him;
and he aided, or succoured, him; or that the
former phrase has the former signification; and
the latter phrase, the latter signification; though
accord. to the TK, both phrases have the former
signification, and the former phrase has also the
latter signification;]) but you should not say فَزَعَهُ,
(K, TA,) i. e. like مَنَعَهُ: (TA:) [or] from الفَزَعُ
as signifying “ fear,” or “ fright,” you say فَزِعْتُ
إِلَيْكَ and فَزِعْتُ مِنْكَ; [app. meant to indicate that
the former phrase signifies I betook myself to thee
in fear, which is a meaning thereof well known,
and nearly agreeing with an explanation of the
verb followed by إِلَيْهِ which will be found below
in this paragraph; and that the latter phrase signifies I feared thee, or I was, or became, in fear,
&c., of thee, the only meaning, of this phrase, for
which I find any explicit authority, and one for
which I have given three authorities in the first
sentence of this art.;] but you should not say
فَزِعْتُكَ: (S: [thus in my copies, فَزِعْتُكَ, not
فَزَعْتُكَ:]) or فَزِعَ إِلَيْهِمْ signifies he sought, or
demanded, of them, aid, or succour; and فَزَعَهُمْ
and فَزِعَهُمْ signify he aided, or succoured, them,
syn. أَغَاثَهُمْ [in the CK اَعانَهُمْ] and نَصَرَهُمْ, like
↓ أَفْزَعَهُمْ: (K, TA:) accord. to IB, فَزِعْتُهُ meaning
أَغَثْتُهُ is originally فَزِعْتُ له [primarily signifying
I feared, or became in fear &c., for him]; then
the ل was dropped; for one says فَزِعْتُهُ and فَزِعْتُ
لَهُ: (TA:) or فَزِعَ, like فَرِحَ, signifies اِنْتَصَرَ: (K:
[thus in the copies of the K, and hence in the TA,
app. a mistranscription for اِسْتَنْصَرَ, he sought, or
demanded, aid, or aid against an enemy:]) and
فَزِعَ إِلَيْهِ he betook himself, or had recourse, to him,
or it, for refuge, protection, or preservation, (S, O,
Msb, K, TA,) by reason of fear, or fright, (S,)
and sought, or demanded, aid, or succour, by him,
or it; whence, in a trad. respecting the eclipse of
the sun, فَافْزَعُواإِلَى الصَّلَاة i. e. Then betake yourselves, &c., to prayer, and seek, or demand, aid,
or succour, by it. (TA.) ―
-b3-  فَزِعَ مِنْ نَوْمِهِ means
He became roused from his sleep; (O, K;) because he who is roused is not free from some fear,
or fright: occurring in a trad. in this sense. (O.)
And one says, فَزِعْتُ بِمَجِىْءِ فُلَانٍ, meaning I
prepared [or roused] myself by reason of the
coming of such a one, by a change of state, or
condition, like as the sleeper passes from the state
of sleeping to that of waking. (TA.)
-A2-  فَزَعَهُ in
the phrase فَفَزَعَهُ ↓ فَازَعَهُ means He exceeded him
in fear, or fright. (TA.)
-A3-  فُزِعَ عَنْ قُلُوبِهِمْ: see
the next paragraph.
2
فزّعهُ: see 4. ―
-b2-  [It also app. signifies He
made a fearful event, or fearful events, to befall
him: see its pass. part. n. below.] ―
-b3-  فَزَّعَ عَنْهُ
He removed from him fear, or fright: (O, in two
places:) it is implied by the context in the K that
عنه ↓ افزع has this meaning; but in the O and
other lexicons it is فَزَّعَ. (TA.) And فُزِّعَ عَنْهُ,
(S, K,) inf. n. تَفْزِيعٌ, (K,) Fear, or fright, was
removed from him. (S, K.) It is said in the
Kur [xxxiv. 22], حَتَّى إِذَافُزِّعَ عَنْ قُلُوبِهِمْ, meaning Until, when fear, or fright, shall be removed
from their hearts: (S, O:) this is the common
reading: another reading is فَزَّعَ, i. e. فَزَّعَ اللّٰهُ:
and El-Hasan reads ↓ فُزِعَ: and he says that in
this reading and the first, the prep. with its noun
are [regarded as supplying the place of the agent
and therefore virtually] in the nom. case, as in
the phrase سِيرَ عَنِ البَلَدِ: (TA:) some read فُرِّغَ
[q. v.]: (O and TA in art. فرغ:) and 'Eesà Ibn-
'Omar is related to have read إِذَا افْرَنْقَعَ. (TA in
art. فرقع.)
3
فازعهُ فَفَزَعَهُ [He vied with him in fear, or
fright,] and he exceeded him therein. (TA. See
1, last sentence but one.)
4
افزعهُ, (Msb, K,) inf. n. إِفْزَاعٌ, (S, O,) He
made him to fear, or to be afraid; frightened
him; or terrified him; (S, * O, * Msb, K;) as
also ↓ فزّعهُ, (S, O, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَفْزِيعٌ. (S, O.)
And you say, يُفْزَعُ مِنْهُ [One is made to fear, or
be afraid of, or is frightened, or terrified, at, it,
or him], (S, O, K,) and مِنْ أَجْلِهِ [on account of
him, or for the sake of him], (O, K,) and بِهِ [by
him, or by means of him]. (O.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] He
housed him from his sleep. (K, TA. [See 1, last
quarter.]) ―
-b3-  Also He aided, or succoured, him.
(S, K.) See 1, former half; and again, in the
latter half. ―
-b4-  See also 2.

تَفَزَّعَ see 1, first sentence.
فَزَعٌ Fear, or fright: (S, O, K:) originally (S)
an inf. n.; but notwithstanding this, (S, * O, K,)
sometimes, (S, O,) having a pl., which is أَفْزَاعٌ.
(S, O, K.) ―
-b2-  [And, as seems to be indicated by
an explanation of مُفَزَّعٌ (q. v.), A fearful event:
pl. as above.]
فَزِعٌ Fearing; being afraid or frightened or
terrified; (Er-Rághib, MA, Msb, TA;) thus in
a verse cited voce ظُنْبُوبٌ; (Er-Rághib, TA;) and
↓ مُفَازِعٌ is syn. therewith: (O, K:) and one says
also ↓ رَجُلٌ فَازِعٌ, pl. فَزَعَةٌ; and ↓ مَفْزُوعٌ; meaning
a man put in fear; made afraid; frightened, or
terrified. (TA.) And In a state of disquiet, disturbance, or agitation: whence an extraordinary
reading, of four readers, in the Kur xxviii. 9, [i. e.
فَزِعًا] for فَارِغًا, relating to the heart of the mother
of Moses, meaning in a state of disquiet, &c.,
almost quitting its pericardium. (TA.) It has no
broken pl.; its only pl. being فَزِعُونَ. (TA.) ―
-b2-
Also Seeking, or demanding, aid, or succour; and
Sgh thus explains it [in the O] as used in the verse
above mentioned; but Er-Rághib says that this
is an explanation of the intended meaning, not of
the literal signification: (TA:) and it has also the
contr. meaning, aiding, or succouring; thus being
trans., though of the measure فَعِلٌ; but it may be
altered from ↓ فَازِعٌ, like as حَذِرٌ is [said to be]
altered from حَاذِرٌ. (IB, TA,)
فَزْعَةٌ: see فَزَعَةٌ.
فُزْعَةٌ A man whom one is made to fear, of whom
one is made afraid, or at whom one is frightened:
(O, K:) [like مَفْزَعَةٌ as expl. by Lth and others:]
and by whom, or by means of whom, one is made
afraid, or frightened. (O.)
فَزَعَةٌ sing. of فَزَعَات in the phrase فَزَعَاتُ الرُّوعِ
[app. meaning The fears, or frights, of the heart].
(TA. [The sing., as well as the pl., is there said
to be thus, بِالتَّحْرِيك; but if the former be, as
I think it is, an inf. n. un., it should by rule be
↓ فَزْعَةٌ.])
فُزَعَةٌ One who fears men, or is frightened at
them: (K:) or one who fears, or is frightened,
much, or often; (O;) [and] so ↓ فَزَّاعَةٌ. (TA.
[But see what next follows.])
فَزَّاعَةٌ One who makes men to fear, or frightens
them, much, or often. (O, K.) See also فُزَعَةٌ.
فَازِغٌ: see فَزِعٌ, in two places.
مَفْزَعٌ i. q. مَلْجَأْ [as meaning A refuge, i. e. a
place to which, or a person to whom, one betakes
himself, or has recourse, for refuge, protection, or
preservation,] (S, O, Msb, K, TA,) on the occasion of the befalling of an affliction or a calamity;
(TA;) applied to a sing. and a pl. (S, O, K) and
a dual (S, O) and a masc. and a fem.; (S, O, K;)
one says, فُلَانٌ مَفْزَعٌ لِلنَّاسِ Such a one is a refuge
to men when an event comes upon them suddenly,
and هُمَامَفْزَعٌ لِلنَّاسِ, and هُمْ مَفْزَعٌ, &c.; (S, O;)
and ↓ مَفْزَعَةٌ is the same in signification and in its
applications; (K;) expl. by IF as signifying a
place to which one who is in fear, or frightened,
betakes himself, or has recourse, for refuge, protection, or preservation: (TA:) or مَفْزَعٌ signifies
one of whom aid, or succour, is sought, or demanded: (K:) and ↓ مَفْزَعَةٌ, [a cause of fear or
fright; being a word of the class of مَبْخَلَةٌ and
مَجْبَنَةٌ; i. e.] a thing that one is made to fear, or
at which one is frightened; (S;) or a person whom
one is made to fear, or at whom one is frightened;
[like فُزْعَةٌ;] or on account of whom, or for the sake
of whom, one is made to fear, or is frightened:
(Lth, O, K:) you say, فُلَانٌ لَنَا مَفْزَعَةٌ [Such a
one is to us a person whom we are made to fear,
&c.], and in like manner you say of a female, and
of a pl. number. (O.)
مَفْزَعَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in
two places.
مُفَزَّعٌ Cowardly; (Fr, O, K;) as being made
to fear, or to be frightened at, everything: (Fr,
O:) and courageous; (Fr, O, K;) as being one
the like of whom fearful events are made to befall
(بِمِثْلِهِ تُنْزَلُ الأَفْزَاعُ). (Fr, O. [But what here
follows suggests another reason, and I think a
better, for the latter meaning.]) مُفَزَّعَةٌ applied by
'Amr Ibn-Maadee-Kerib as an epithet to his اِسْت,
in replying to a threat of El-Ash-'ath, who had
said to him, لَوْ دَنَوْتَ لَأُضَرِّطَنَّكَ, means Secure
from being overcome by fear, or fright, and
[therefore] not lax so as to break wind [in consequence of fear]; being from فَزَّعَ عَنْهُ meaning
“ he removed fear, or fright, from him; ” or it
may be for the same reason as that for which
مُفَزَّعٌ is applied to a courageous man. (O.)
مَفْزُوعٌ: see فَزِعٌ, first sentence.
مُفَازِعٌ: see فَزِعٌ, first sentence.
