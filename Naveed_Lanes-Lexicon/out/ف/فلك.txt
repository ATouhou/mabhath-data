فلّك, (S, O, K,) inf. n. تَفْكِيكٌ, (S,) said of a

(AA, T, S, O, TA:) accord. to Lth, فَلَّكْتُ الجَدْىَ
signifies I put a twig around the tongue of the

تَفَلَّكَ see 2, first sentence.
فُلْكٌ A ship: (S, O, Msb, K, &c.:) [also particularly applied to the ark of Noah; as in the
Kur-án vii. 62, &c.:] the word is generally thus
only; but some say ↓ فُلُكٌ also, with two dammehs;
and it is held that this may be the original form;
and that فُلْكٌ may be a contraction, like as عُنْقٌ is
[of غُنُقٌ accord. to Sb]: (MF, TA:) it is masc.
and fem., (S, O, K, *) and sing. and pl., (S, O, K,)
and Ibn-'Abbád says that it has فُلُوكٌ also for a
pl.: (O:) [it is said that] it may be sing., and in
this case masc.; and pl., and in this case fem.:
(IB, Msb:) [but see what here follows:] it occurs
in the Kur-án in the following (and other) places:
in xxvi. 119, &c.; where it is sing. and masc.:
(S, O, TA:) and in [xvi. 14 and] xxxv. 13;
where it is pl. [and fem.]: (TA:) and in ii. 159;
where it is fem., and may be either pl. or sing.:
it seems that, when it is sing., it is regarded as
meaning the مَرْكَب, and is therefore made masc.;
or the سَفِينَة, and is therefore made fem.: (S, O,
TA:) or, (K,) as Sb used to say, (S, O, TA,) the
فُلْك that is a pl. [in meaning] is a broken pl. of
that, (S, O, K, TA,) i. e. of the فُلْك, (IB, O, K,
TA,) that is a sing. [in meaning]: and it is not
like الجُنُبُ, which is sing. and pl. [in meaning],
and the like thereof (S, O, K, TA) among substs.,
such as الطِّفْلُ &c.; (S, O, TA;) for فُلْكَانِ has
been heard from the Arabs as dual of فُلْكٌ, but
not جُنُبَانِ [or the like] as dual of جُنُبٌ [or the
like]; and they say that what has not been
dualized is not a pl. [form], but [is, or may be,]
a homonym, and what has been dualized [is, or
may be,] a pl. [form]: (MF, TA:) Sb then says
in continuation, (TA,) for فُعْلٌ and فَعَلٌ share in
application to one thing [or meaning], as العُرْبُ
and العَرَبُ, (S, O, K, TA,) &c.; (S, O, TA;) and
as it is allowable for فَعَلٌ to have for its pl. فُعْلٌ,
as in the instance of أَسَدٌ and أُسْدٌ, so too فُعْلٌ
may have for its pl. فُعْلٌ. (S, O, K, TA.) ↓ فُلْكِىٌّ
is a dial. var. of فُلْكٌ; and Abu-d-Dardà read,
[in the Kur x. 23,] كُنْتُمْ فِى الْفُلْكِىِّ [When
ye are in the ships; where others read فى الفُلْكِ;
and where the context shows that the pl. meaning
is intended]. (IJ, TA.)
-A2-  [It may also be a pl.
of the word next following].
الفَلَكُ The place of the revolving of the stars;
(O, K, TA;) [the celestial sphere: but generally
imagined by the Arabs to be a material concave
hemisphere; so that it may be termed the vault
of heaven; or the firmament:] the astronomers
say that it is [a term applied to every one, by
itself, of] seven أَطْوَاق [by which they mean surrounding spheres], exclusive of the سَمَآء [or sky, as
meaning the region of the clouds]; wherein have
been set the seven stars [i. e. the Moon, Mercury,
Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn], in
every طَوْق [or surrounding sphere] a star, some
being higher than others; revolving therein: (TA:)
[it is also commonly imagined that above these is
an eighth sphere, called by the astronomers فَلَكُ
الثَّوَابِتِ (the sphere of the fixed stars), and by
others فَلَكُ الكُرْسِىِّ; and above this, a ninth,
called فَلَكُ الأَطْلَسِ and فَلَكُ العَرْشِ, and also
called الأَثِيرُ (q. v.):] the pl. is أَفْلَاكٌ [a pl. of
pauc.] (S, O, Msb, K, TA) and فُلُكٌ (K, TA)
and فُلْكٌ may be another pl., like as أُسْدٌ and
خُشُبٌ are pls. of أَسَدٌ and خَشَبٌ (S, O, TA.
[Thus accord. to both of my copies of the S, as well
as the O and TA: but it may be that أُسْدٌ and
خُشْبٌ are mistranscriptions for أُسُدٌ and خُشُبٌ;
and therefore that for فُلْكٌ (which is not mentioned as a pl. of فَلَكٌ in the K) we should read
فُلُكٌ.]) And فَلَكُ السَّمآءِ signifies The pole of
heaven; [generally the north celestial pole;]
likened to the pivot, or axis, of the mill-stone.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  Also (i. e. الفَلَكُ) The revolving of the
heaven [or celestial sphere]. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And فَلَكٌ
signifies also The circuit, and main part, of any-
thing. (K.) ―
-b4-  And Waves of the sea in a state
of commotion, (O, K, TA,) circling, (TA,) and
going to and fro. (O, TA.) This, (O, TA,) or
what is next mentioned, (TA,) or the place of
revolving of the stars, (O,) or the pole of heaven,
(TA,) is meant in a trad. where it is said of a
horse smitten by the [evil] eye, that he was as
though he were turning in a فَلَك. (O, TA.) And
Water put in motion by the wind, (O, K, TA,)
going to and fro, in a state of commotion: (O,
TA:) mentioned by Z. (TA.) ―
-b5-  Also A hill,
or mound, of sand, having around it a wide
expanse of land: (IAar, O, K, TA:) or فَلَكٌ مِنَ
الرَّمْلِ signifies rugged, round أَجْوِبَة [app. a pl. of
جَوْبَة (though I do not find it mentioned as such),
and meaning depressed and clear places], of the
sands, like [tracts of] what are termed كَذَّان [or
soft stones resembling dry pieces of clay], hollowed
out by the gazelles. (TA.) ―
-b6-  And Pieces of land,
(S, O, K, TA,) or of sand, (S,) having a circular
form, and elevated above what is around them,
(S, O, K, TA,) with ruggedness and evenness;
(TA;) one whereof is termed ↓ فَلْكَةٌ, (S, O, K,
TA,) with the ل quiescent; pl. فِلَاكٌ; (K, TA;)
i. e. [this is pl. of فَلْكَةٌ,] like قَصْعَةٌ and قِصَاعٌ:
(TA:) in [the book entitled] El-Ghareeb ElMusannaf, [by Aboo-'Amr Esh-Sheybánee, we
find] ↓ فَلَكَةٌ and فَلَكٌ, [each] بِالتَّحْرِيك; [accord.
to which, فَلَكَةٌ is a n. un., and فَلَكٌ is a coll.
gen. n.;] but in “ the Book ” of Sb, [agreeably
with the K, we find] ↓ فَلْكَةٌ [as a sing.] and فَلَكٌ
[as a quasi-pl. n.], like حَلْقَةٌ and حَلَقٌ. (IB, TA.)
―
-b7-  See also فَلْكَةٌ, in two places.
فَلِكٌ A slave (AA, O) having a buttock like
the فَلْكَة [or whirl] of a spindle (AA, O, K) in
shape; (AA, O;) resembling the Zenj; (K;) [for]
the buttocks of the Zenj are round: (AA, O:) or
large in the buttocks. (TA.) And (O, K) it is
said to signify (O) Thick, or coarse of make, in
the joints: (O, K:) and loose in the bones; (K;)
or weak, loose in the bones, and flaccid; thus expl.
by Ibn-'Abbád: (O:) and having a pain in his
patella (فِى فَلْكَةِ رُكْبَتِهِ). (O, K.)
فُلُكٌ: i. q. فُلْكٌ, q. v.
-A2-  And a pl. of فَلَكٌ.
(K, TA.)
فَلْكَةٌ The whirl of a spindle: (MA:) [this is
what is meant by the saying that] the فَلْكَة of the
مِغْزَل is well known; (K;) [and] is thus called
because of its roundness: (S, O:) [it is a piece of
wood, generally of a hemispherical form, or
nearly so, through the middle of which the upper
part of the spindle-pin is inserted:] also pronounced ↓ فِلْكَة: (O, K:) the pl. [of the former]
is ↓ فَلَكٌ [or rather this is a quasi-pl. n.] and [that
of the latter sing. is] فِلَكٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And A
thing that is made round, or hemispherical,
(↓ يُفَلَّكُ, or ↓ يُفْلَكُ, accord. to different copies of
the K,) like the فَلْكَة of the spindle, of coarse hair
(هُلْب), then the tongue of the young unweaned
camel is perforated, [and this thing is inserted
into it, (see 2, and see also 4 in art. لهج,)] in
order that he may be prevented from sucking. (K.
[For فتَخْرِقُ لِسانُ الفَصِيلِ in the CK, I read
فَيُخْرَقُ لِسَانُ الفَصِيلِ, as in other copies of the K
and in the TA: after these words, the copies of
the K have فَيُعْضَدُ بِهِ, app a mistranscription for
some phrase meaning فَيُجْعَلُ فِيهِ, which is necessary to complete the explanation.]) ―
-b3-  And An
[eminence such as is termed] أَكَمَهٌ [formed] of
one mass of stone; (K, TA;) accord. to ISh, [of]
the smaller of the [eminences termed] إِكَام, compact in its head, as though this were the فَلْكَة of a
spindle, not giving growth to anything, in height
of the measure of two spears or a spear and a
half. (TA.) ―
-b4-  See also فلَكٌ, near the end, in
two places. ―
-b5-  Also Anything circular, (K.) ―
-b6-
And [particularly] The joint [or cartilaginous
disk] between the two vertebræ [i. e. between any
one of the vertebrœ and that next to it] of the
camel: (K, TA:) and the pl. [or rather quasi-pl.
n.] thereof, in this sense and in the last two of
the sense following, is ↓ فَلَكٌ. (TA.) ―
-b7-  [And
The cap of the knee; (see فَلِكٌ;) فَلْكَةُ الرُّكْبَةِ signifying the patella: so in the present day.] ―
-b8-
And The small thing (الهَنَةُ [app. the foramen
cæcum, from its round form, for, though the TA
adds the epithet النَّاشِئَةُ, which means “ rising,” I
think that this addition may be conjectural,])
upon the head of the root of the tongue. (K.) ―
-b9-
And The side of the [portion of the breast called
the] زَوْر [q. v.], and the part thereof that is round,
or circular. (K. [K. [But see بَلْدَةٌ: where it is said
that “ the فَلَك of the زَوْر of a horse are six in
number: ” what they are I have been unable to
determine: I incline to think that they may be
spiral curls, such as are termed دَوَائِر, pl. of
دَائِرَةٌ.])

round, (K, TA,) like the فَلْكَة [or whirl (of a
spindle)]. (TA.) [And the former is also applied
as an epithet to the breast: for] AA says that
[the pl.] فَوَالِكُ is applied to breasts (ثُدِىّ) that
are less than such as are termed نَوَاهِدُ. (TA.)
فَيْلَكُونٌ The شُوبَق [or baker's rolling-pin: see
