incision in the nose [or muzzle] of the camel, (S,
O, K, TA,) the beast being refractory, (TA,)
with an iron instrument, (S, O, TA,) so as to

then put upon the place of the incision the [cord
called] جَرِير, (S, O, TA, *) with a [string such as
is termed] وَتَر wound upon it, (S, O,) to render
him tractable, or to train him, thereby: (S, O,
K, TA:) sometimes the refractory camel has
three incisions made in his muzzle; and when
his owner desires to render him tractable, and to
prevent him from being brisk above measure, he
puts the جرير upon the incision that is next to
his lip, and in consequence he governs him as he
will; and if he be between the refractory and the
tractable, he puts the جرير upon the intermediate
incision, and in consequence he exceeds in his
pace; and if he desire that he should stretch
forth and go without inconvenience to his owner,
he puts the جرير upon the uppermost incision.
(Aboo-Ziyád, L.) [The incision above mentioned
is termed ↓ فُقْرَةٌ. ―
-b5-  Hence, app., by a tropical
usage, فَقَرَ signifies (assumed tropical:)  He stigmatized a man:

فَقُرَ, inf. n. فَقْرٌ, He, or it, broke the فَقَار

his فَقَار [or vertebræ]; like أَرْكَبَ: (O:) or he
(a colt, Msb), or it (the back of a colt, L), became
[strong in the vertebræ and] fit for being ridden.
(L, Msb.)
-A2-  افقرهُ نَاقَتَهُ, (S, O,) or بَعِيرَهُ, (ISk,
K,) or ظَهْرَ بَعِيرِهِ, (TA,) or بَعِيرًا, (Mgh,) or دَابَّتَهُ,
(A 'Obeyd, TA,) or المُهْرَ, (Msb,) He lent him the
vertebræ [meaning the back] of his she-camel, that
he might ride thereon: (S, O:) and he lent him
the back of his camel (ISk, K, TA) during a
journey, (ISk, TA) for carrying a burden, and
for riding, (ISk, K, TA,) to be returned afterwards: (ISk, TA:) and he lent him a camel, that
he might ride thereon; from فَقَار signifying the
“ vertebræ ” of the back: (Mgh:) and he lent
him his beast to ride as long as he pleased during
a journey and then to return it to him: (A 'Obeyd,
TA:) and he lent him the colt to ride upon its
vertebræ [or back]. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  Hence, افقرهُ أَرْضَهُ
(tropical:)  He lent him his land for sowing. (TA, from a
trad.) ―
-b3-  أَفْقَرَكَ الصَّيْدُ means The object of the
chase has enabled thee to have its vertebræ within

TA:) or has enabled thee to have its side [which
is sometimes termed فُقْر] within thy power: (K:)
or has become near to thee. (TA.) [The Khaleefeh] El-Weleed the son of Yezeed the son of 'AbdEl-Melik is related to have said, أَفْقَرَ بَعْدَ مَسْلَمَةَ
الصَّيْدُ لِمَنْ رَمَى i. e. The object of the chase has
enabled the shooter at it to have its vertebræ

the territory of the Muslims had become assailable to him who might attempt it. (TA.)
-A3-
افقرهُ also signifies He (i. e. God, S, O, K, or a
man, Msb) rendered him فَقِير [meaning poor, or

-A4-  مَا أَفْقَرَهُ [i. e.
How poor, or needy, &c., is he!] and مَا أَغْنَاهُ
[which has the contr. meaning] are [said to be] anomalous; for their [respective primitive] verbs are
اِفْتَقَرَ and اِسْتَغْنَى, from either of which the verb
of wonder is not properly [or regularly] formed.
(S, O. [But see 8.])

ظَهَرَ قَبْلَنَا نَاسٌ يَتَفَقَّرُونَ العِلْمَ, occurring in a
trad., as some relate it, means [There appeared
before us men] eliciting what was recondite, or
obscure, of knowledge, and opening what was
closed thereof; from فَقَرْتُ البِئْرَ meaning “ I dug

ق before the ف. (IAth, TA.) ―

8
افتقر He clave, slit, or rent; and opened:
[see also 1, fourth sentence:] hence its usage in a
trad. of 'Omar, in which, after his saying that
Imra-el-Keys was the foremost of the poets, and
had made the source of poetry to well forth abundantly to them, [see خَسَفَ,] he is related to have
added, وَافْتَقَرَ عَنْ مَعانٍ عُورٍأَصَحَّ بَصَرٍ: in saying
this, he attributed a sound and an opened sight to
the poetry, [which he thus personified,] and in
like manner he described obscure and occult
meanings by applying to them the epithet عُور
[generally meaning “ blind of one eye ”]: he
meant that Imra-el-Keys had made the meanings
of poetry clear and perspicuous, and unveiled
them, and shunned substitution and obscure diction: عَنْ with what is [to be understood as]
antecedently connected with it occupies the place
of a noun in the accus. case as a denotative of
state: it is as though he said, فَتَحَ لِلشِّعْرِأَصَحَّ
بَصَرٍ مُجَاوِزًا لِلْمَعَانِى العُورِمُتَخَطِيًا لَهَا [lit. He
opened, to poetry, a most sound vision, passing
over half-blind meanings]. (O.)
-A2-  Also, (O,)
He was, or became, فَقِير [meaning poor, or needy,
&c.]; (S, O, Msb, K, &c.;) and so ↓ فَقِرَ, aor.

they said افتقر, (Sb, Msb, TA,) like as they said
اِشْتَدَّ, (Sb, TA,) but they did not say فَقُرَ, (Sb,
Msb, TA,) like as they did not say شَدُدَ, (Sb, TA,)
افتقر serving them instead of فَقُرَ; (Msb;) nor
did they use any unaugmented form of this verb.
(Sb, TA.) ―
-b2-  And one says, افتقر إِلَيْهِ He, or it,
wanted, needed, or required, him, or it; [a phrase
of frequent occurrence; like فَقِيرٌ إِلَيْهِ;] i. q. اِحْتَاجَ
اليه. (TA in art. حوج.)
10
استفقر بَعِيرًا [He borrowed, or asked for the
loan of, the back of a camel, for carrying a burden
or for riding]. (See أَرْمَلُ.)
فَقْرٌ and ↓ فُقْرٌ signify the same, (S, O, Msb, K,)
but the latter is bad, (Lth, TA,) and sometimes
they said ↓ فُقُرٌ, (MF, TA,) Poverty, want, or
need; contr. of غِنًى: (K:) or the state of a man
when he has [only] what suffices for his household,
or those who dwell with him and whose maintenance is incumbent on him: (ISd, K:) [other
meanings are indicated by explanations of the
epithet فَقِيرٌ, q. v.:] ↓ مَفاَقِرُ [signifying needs, or
wants,] is said by some to be a pl. of فَقرٌ, anomalous, like مَشَابِهُ [pl. of شَبَهٌ] and مَلَامِحُ [pl. of
لَمْحَةٌ]: or it may be a pl. of ↓ مُفْقَرٌ, an inf. n. of
أَفْقَرَهُ; or pl. of ↓ مُفْقِرٌ; or it has no sing.: (TA:)
you say, ↓ سَدَّ اللّٰهُ مَفَاقِرَهُ God rendered him, or
may God render him, free from want; (S, Msb,
K;) [lit.] God supplied, or may God supply, his
various needs, or wants. (S, K.) ―
-b2-  And فَقْرٌ signifies also Anxiety; or disquietude, or trouble, of
mind: pl. فُقُورٌ: (O, K, TA:) one says, شَكَى إِلَيْهِ
فُقُورَهُ He complained to him of his anxieties; &c.:
and it means also, his circumstances, and wants:
(TA:) [for,] accord. to IAar, the phrase فُقُورُ
النَّفْسِ is like شُقُورُهَا. (O.)
-A2-  See also فَقْرَةٌ.
فُقْرٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.

فُقُرٌ: see فَقْرٌ.
فَقْرَةٌ: see فَقَارٌ.
-A2-  Accord. to the K, it signifies
also A certain plant; and its pl. [or rather the
coll. gen. n.] is ↓ فَقْرٌ: but the sing. [or n. un.] is
correctly ↓ فَقُرَةٌ, with fet-h and then damm, mentioned by Sb as a word of a rare form, of which
the pl. [or coll. gen. n.] is ↓ فَقُرٌ, as it has no
broken pl.; and expl. by Th. (TA.)
فُقْرَةٌ A hollow dug in the ground: pl. فُقَرٌ. (O,
K, TA.) ―
-b2-  And The [incision termed] قُرْمَة
(IAar, O, TA) that is made in the nose [or muzzle]
(IAar, O) of the camel, (IAar, O, TA,) [in order
to render him tractable, (see 1, near the beginning,)] after which [if necessary] another is made,
[above it,] and then another, until he becomes
gentle: (IAar, O:) pl. [of pauc. أَفْقُرٌ, occurring
in the L, evidently as a pl. of فُقْرَةٌ in this sense,
and, of mult., but also used as a pl. of pauc.,]
فُقَرٌ. (O, TA.) Hence the saying of 'Aacute;ïsheh, in
relation to [the murder of] 'Othmán, [app. alluding
to its involving three violations, namely, the violation of the sacredness of the city in which it was
perpetrated and of the month in which it occurred
and of the person of the Khaleefeh,] بَلَغْتُمْ مِنْهُ
الفُقَرَ الثَّلَاثَ, meaning (tropical:)  Ye have done to him the
like of your deed to the camel above mentioned
[upon which ye have inflicted the three فُقَر]: thus
expl. by AZ. (TA.) Accord. to AHeyth, فُقَرٌ
means (assumed tropical:)  Great, or grievous, or formidable, events.
(O.) And the three فُقَرَات of the son of Adam
are said to be (assumed tropical:)  The day of birth and the day of

to me. (K, * TA.)
-A3-  See also مُفْقِرٌ.
فِقْرَةٌ: see فَقَارٌ. ―
-b2-  [Hence] الفِقَرَاتُ is a name of
(assumed tropical:)  The star [or stars] in the خَرَزَات [meaning joints
of the tail] of Scorpio. (Kzw in his descr. of
Scorpio.) And فِقَرٌ signifies (assumed tropical:)  Certain ornaments,
moulded, or fashioned, in the form of the vertebra
of the back: (A, KT, TA, and Har p. 34:) one
of which is termed فِقْرَةٌ. (Har ibid.) ―
-b3-  And
hence, (KT,) or as being likened to a vertebra
of the back, (S, O, KT,) (tropical:)  The best verse in an
ode is termed فِقْرَةٌ. (S, O, K, KT.) ―
-b4-  And
hence, as being likened to the best verse in an
ode, فِقْرَهٌ means (tropical:) (tropical:)  Any choice phrase or sentence:
(KT:) one says, مَا أَحْسَنَ فِقَرَ كَلَامِهِ i. e. [How
beautiful are] the points, or points of wit, (سُكَت
[pl. of نُكْتَةٌ]) of his speech, or language! (A,
TA.) ―
-b5-  And in like manner it is applied to signify (assumed tropical:)  The end [or final word] of every verse of
an ode and [of every clause] of a خُطْبَة [which is
in rhyming prose]. (Msb.) ―
-b6-  And (assumed tropical:)  [A pair of
clauses of rhyming prose, both ending with the
same rhyme; i. e.] the فِقْرَة is that which in
[rhyming] prose is like the verse in poetry. (Kull
p. 208.)
-A2-  Also A piece of land, such as is
termed قَرَاح [q. v.], for sowing. (O, K.)
-A3-  And

TA,) to men contending, or competing, in shooting,
or casting, (Lth,) such as a mountain, (K,) or
such as a hill, or a hollow dug in the ground,
(Lth.) or a هَدَف [or butt, &c.], (Lth, K, TA,)
and the like: (K, TA:) they say, in such contending or competing, أُرَامِيكَ مِنْ أَدْنَى فِقْرَةٍ [I
will contend, or compete, with thee in shooting, or
casting, from the nearest فقرة] and مِنْ أَبْعَدِ فِقْرَةٍ
[from the furthest فقرة]. (Lth, TA.)
فَقُرَةٌ: see فَقْرَةٌ.
فُقْرَى [The lending one a camel, &c., to be ridden
or to carry a burden;] a subst. [similar to رُقْبَى

order, one upon another, from the part where is
the كَاهِل to the عَجْب: (K, * TA:) [it is sometimes used as a sing., as in the S and O and K voce
طَبَقٌ: but properly] the sing., (Msb, K,) or n. un.,
(S, TA,) is ↓ فَقَارَةٌ, (S, Msb, K,) for which one
should not say فِقَارَةٌ, with kesr: (ISk, Msb:) and
↓ فِقْرَةٌ, of which the pl. is فِقَرٌ and فِقْرَاتٌ and فِقَرَاتٌ
and فِقِرَاتٌ, signifies the same as فَقَارَةٌ; (S, Msb,
K:) as does also ↓ فَقْرَةٌ. (K.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] فَقَارُ
الجَوْزَآءِ (assumed tropical:)  The three very bright stars [d and e and
z] disposed obliquely in the midst of the constellation الجوزآء [i. e. Orion]. (Har p. 456. [See art.
جوز.) ―
-b3-  And [hence also,] ذُو الفَقَارِ (assumed tropical:)  the name
of A [celebrated] sword of the Prophet, (S, O, K,)
and afterwards, of 'Alee: it had previously belonged to El-'As Ibn-Munebbih, who was slain
at Bedr, (O, K,) by 'Alee, by whom his sword
was given to the Apostle: (O:) accord. to Abu-l-'Abbás [i. e. Th]. it was thus named because there
were in it small beautiful hollows [app. meaning
small scallops in the edge, such as some modern
swords have, for the more easy cleaving of coats
of mail]: it is also, accord. to some, called ذو
الفِقَار; but this is said by El-Khattábee to be
vulgar. (TA.) ―
-b4-  It (i. e. ذُوالفَقَارِ) is also used,
metaphorically, as meaning (tropical:)  The spear. (TA.)
فَقِيرٌ A hollow that is dug around the shoot, or
offset, of a palm-tree, when it is planted: (S, O:)

dammehs: (K, TA:) or this [app. the pl., but
accord. to the TA the sing.,] signifies wells, (K,
TA,) three, and more, together, (TA,) or communicating, one with another. (K, TA.) The
sing. signifies also A well: (Mgh, O:) or an old

-b2-  And A plain, or soft,
place, in which wells are dug forming a regular

-b3-  Also

-A2-  As an epithet applied to a camel,
it means Having an incision [or two incisions or
three] made in his nose [or muzzle] in the manner
explained in the first paragraph of this art.; and
so ↓ مَفْقُورٌ. (K, TA.)
-A3-  Also, applied to a man,

or having a complaint of the vertebræ of his back,
arising from fracture or from disease: (Msb:)
or having his vertebræ pulled out from his back,

TA:) and فقير and ↓ مَفْقُورٌ, a man afflicted [lit.
having the vertebræ of his back broken] by a calamity. (Msb.)
-A4-  Hence, as though having the
vertebræ of his back broken, (IDrst, TA in art.
جبر,) [but said to be irregularly formed from
اِفْتَقَرَ, like مَا أَفْقَرَهُ, q. v.,] Poor: or needy; contr.
of غَنِىٌّ; (as implied in the K;) having [only]
what suffices for his household, or those who dwell
with him and whose maintenance is incumbent an
him: (ISd, K:) or one who finds food sufficient
to sustain life: (K:) or one who possesses only what
is sufficient for life: (ISk, S, K: *) or one whose
property is, or has become, little: further expl. in
art. سكن: (Msb:) or one who has what to eat;
(Aboo-'Amr Ibn-El-'Alà;) differing from مِسْكِينٌ,
which signifies one who possesses nothing; altogether destitute: (Aboo-'Amr Ibn-El-'Alà, ISk,
S, O, K:) or both mean destitute, i. e. possessing
nothing: (IAar, S, O:) Aboo-Haneefeh holds the
opinion of ISk, (TA,) who cites the following
verse from a poem of Er-Rá'ee in praise of
'Abd-El-Melik Ibn-Marwán;
أَمَّا الفَقِيرُ الَّذِى كَانَتْ حَلُوبَتُهُ
وَفْقَ العِيَالِ فَلَمْ يُتْرَكْ لَهُ سَبَدُ
[As to the فقير whose milch camel was sufficient
for his household, and nothing (more) was left to
him:] (S, O, TA:) As says that the مسكين is
better in condition than the فقير: and Yoo says
that the فقير is better in condition than the
مسكين; and adds, I asked an Arab of the desert,
Art thou فقير? and he answered, No, by God,
but rather مسكين: (S, O, TA:) or the former
signifies needy, needing, or wanting; a needer;
and the latter, one abased by need or want, or
otherwise; (Ibn-'Arafeh, O, K;) who, if abased
by need or want, may lawfully receive of the
poor-rate; but if abased otherwise than by
need or want, he may not receive of the poorrate; for he may be rich: (Ibn-'Arafeh:) [الفَقِيرُ
إِلَى اللّٰهِ the needer of God, i. e., of God's help, &c.,
and الفَقِيرُ إِلَى رَحْمَةِ اللّٰهِ the needer of the mercy of
God, are epithets which a man often writes before
his name:] it is said in the Kur [xxxv. 16], أَنْتُمُ
الفُقَرَآءُ إِلَى اللّٰهِ وَاللّٰهُ هُوَ الْغَنِىُّ الْحَمِيدُ, which is
explained as meaning Ye are the needers, or they
who stand in need, of God: [and God, He is the
Self-sufficient, the Praised in every case:] (O, *
TA: [see also the Kur xxviii. 24:]) or فقير signifies one who is crippled, or deprived of the power
of motion, by disease, or who suffers from a protracted disease, being weak, and who has no trade;
and one who has a mean trade that does not suffice
for his need; and مسكين, a beggar, who has a
trade that stands in some stead, (حِرْفَةٌ تَقَعُ مَوْقِعًا,)
but does not cause him and his household to be
without want; (Esh-Sháfi'ee, T, O, K;) so that
the former is in a harder condition than the latter
accord. to Esh-Sháfi'ee; (T;) and it seems that
he is called فقير because of crippleness, or protracted disease, which prevents his freely employing himself in making gain: (Khálid Ibn-Yezeed:) As also says that the latter is in a
better condition than the former; (S, O, K;) and
so says Ahmad Ibn-'Obeyd: (TA:) and as to
the verse of Er-Rá'ee, cited above, it is said to
mean that the person there mentioned had a
milch camel in former times, but possessed it no
longer, and that لَمْ يُتْرَكْ لَهُ سَبَد means that
nothing was left to him: (Mgh:) the pl. of the
latter epithet is also applied in the Kur xviii. 78
to men possessing a ship, or boat, which is worth
a considerable sum; (Mgh;) whence Aboo-Bekr
holds the opinion of As to be correct: (TA:)
but it is urged in reply, that these men were
hirers, not owners, of the vessel, as appears from
one reading, [app. يُعَمَّلُونَ for يَعْمَلُونَ,] with
teshdeed: (TA:) or the former signifies one who
has neither property nor gain that suffices for his
need; and the latter, one who has property or
gain not sufficient for him: or, as some say, the
converse is the truth: (Bd in ix. 60:) or both
signify the same, (IAar, S, K,) one who possesses
nothing: (IAar, S:) or when they are used together, they differ in signification; and when used
separately, they both [sometimes] signify the
same: (El-Bedr El-Karáfee:) [see more voce
مِسْكِينٌ:] fem. with ة: (Msb, K:) pl. masc. فُقَرَآءُ;
(Msb, K;) pl. fem. فَقَائِرُ, (K,) and فُقَرَآءُ (Lh,
Msb, TA) like the masc., [said to be] the only
instance of the kind except سُفَهَآءُ as pl. of سَفِيهَةٌ;

فَاقِرَةٌ [An act that breaks, or will break, the
vertebræ of the back: and hence,] (assumed tropical:)  a calamity,
or misfortune; (S, O, K;) as also ↓ فَيْقَرٌ: (S, O,
K:) or, accord. to Lth and others, such as breaks
the vertebræ of the back: (TA:) pl. فَوَاقِرُ. (Har
p. 399.) عَمِلَ بِهِ الفَاقِرَةَ is a prov., meaning He
did to him an act breaking, or that would break,
his vertebræ; or a calamity, or misfortune, as in
the Kur lxxv. 25: (Meyd:) [or, accord. to J, it
app. means he did to him that which would render
him tractable; for he says,] it is from the phrase
فَقَرْتُ أَنْفَ البَعِيرِ. (S. [This phrase in the S has
been strangely misunderstood by Golius; who
has consequently, after mentioning the meaning
“ infortunium,” added “ et Habena seu capistrum,
de quo in Conj. 1. ”]) ―

manner] ↓ ذُوفُقْرَةٍ, so applied, strong to be ridden:
(O, TA:) and مُفْقِرٌ signifies also strong in the
back; applied to a colt: (TA:) and, thus applied,
that has attained to the time when he may be
ridden. (K.) ―
-b2-  And [hence] one says, إِنَّهُ لَمُفْقِرٌ
لِهٰذَا الأَمْرِ (assumed tropical:)  Verily he is equal to this affair, possessing firmness of mind, or strength, or power, for
it; (ISh, O, L, K;) and لهذا العَزْمِ for this determination, or resolution; and لهذا القِرْنِ for this
