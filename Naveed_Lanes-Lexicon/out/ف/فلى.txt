فلى1
فَلَى رأْسَهُ, (M, Mgh, K,) and ثِيَابَهُ, (Mgh,)
[aor.
فَلِىَ,] inf. n. فَلْىٌ; (M, Mgh;) and رَأْسَهُ ↓ فلّى
also; (K; [but not in my copy of the TA;])
He searched his head, (M, Mgh, K,) and his
clothes, (Mgh,) for lice: (M, Mgh, K:) [and it
appears from an explanation below (see 8) that
افتلى رَأْسَهُ perhaps signifies the same:] or one
says, فَلَيْتُ رَأْسَهُ مِنَ القَمْلِ [I searched his head
for lice]: (S:) or فَلَيْتُ رَأْسِى, aor. as above, and
so the inf. n., signifies I cleared my head of lice.
(Msb.) [See also الفِلَآءُ, below.] In the saying
of 'Amr Ibn-Maadee-kerib,
تَرَاهُ كَالثَّغَامِ يُغَلُّّ مِسْكًا
يَسْوْءُ الفَالِيَاتِ إِذَا فَلَيْنِى
[Thou seest it (meaning the white hair intermixing
with black) like the thagham (the plant so called)
inserted in musk, grieving the lousing women when
they louse me], فَلَيْنِى is for فَلَيْنَنِى, (T, S,) the two
ن being deemed difficult of utterance; (T;) as
Akh says, he has rejected the latter ن because it
is merely a preservative to the verb [lest its affix
should be supposed to form an essential part of
it], whereas the former ن may not be rejected,
because it is the pronoun of the verb. (S.) ―
-b2-
[Hence,] فَلَى الشِّعْرَ, (ISk, T, S, K,) aor. and inf.
n. as above, (TA,) (tropical:)  He considered, and endeavoured to understand, the poetry, and elicited
its meanings, (ISk, T, S, K, TA,) and what was
strange of it: (ISk, S, TA:) or, accord. to the
A, he investigated the meanings of the poetry:
one says, اِفْلِ هٰذَا البَيْتَ فَإِنَّهُ صَعْبٌ (tropical:)  [Investigate
thou the meaning of this verse, for it is difficult].
(TA.) [Freytag has mentioned فَلَا, in art. فلو,
as signifying “ Disquisivit,” and as followed by
عن; from the Deewán of the Hudhalees.] And
فَلَى الأَمْرَ (assumed tropical:)  He considered, or examined, the various
modes of the affair, or case, endeavouring to obtain
a clear knowledge of them, and looked to its result. (T, TA.) And فَلَيْتُ القُومَ بِعَيْنِى (assumed tropical:)  [I examined the people, or party, with my eye, in order
to know them]: and فَلَيْتُ خَبَرَهُمْ (assumed tropical:)  [I examined
their state, or case, in order to know it]. (TA.)
And فَلَاهُ فِى عَقْلِهِ, (T, M, K, TA,) aor. as above,
(T, TA,) and so the inf. n., (M, TA,) (tropical:)  He looked,
or examined, to see what was his intelligence: (T,
TA:) or he tried, or tested, him, in respect of his
intelligence. (M, K, TA.) ―
-b3-  فَلَيْتُ القَوْمَ I entered amid the breaks, or interspaces, of the people;
(T, TA; *) as also فَلَوْتُهُمْ; (T;) and so ↓ أَفْلَيْتُهُمْ.
(TA.) And فَلَى المَفَازَةَ He passed through the
مفازة [i. e. desert, or waterless desert]. (TA.) ―
-b4-
فَلَاهُ بَالسَّيْفِ, aor. يَفْلِيهِ, (K, TA,) inf. n. فَلْىٌ, (TA,)
signifies the same as فَلَاهُ, aor. يَفْلُوهُ, (K, TA,)
inf. n. فَلْوٌ. (TA.) See the latter verb in art. فلو.
-A2-  فَلِىَ i. q. اِنْقَطَعَ [It, or he, was cut, or cut off,
&c.]. (IAar, T, K.)

4
أَفْلَىَ see 1, near the end of the paragraph.
5
تفلّى He applied himself, as to a task, to

depasture the herbage (T, K *) of the فلاة [or

the head is searched for lice (كَمَا يُفْتَلَى الرَّأْسُ or
كما يُفْلَى الرأس accord. to two transcripts from
the T). (T in arts. فلو and فلى of the TT.)
[This meaning of the verb is expl. (imperfectly)
in art. فلو, to which it does not belong.]
10
استفلى رَأْسَهُ, and ↓ تفالى, (S, K,) i. e. تفالى
هُوَ [not تفالى رأسه], (S,) He desired that his head
might be searched for lice. (S, K.)
-A2-  And استفلاهُ

أَمَاتَرَانِى رَابِطَ الجَنَانِ
أَفْلِيهِ بِالسَّيْفِ إِذَا اسْتَفْلَانِى
[Dost thou not see me to be strong of heart? I
will strike and cut his head with the sword when
he exposes himself to be so struck &c.]
[
فِلْيَةٌ, mentioned in this art. by Freytag, with
فَلَالِىٌّ as its pl., is taken by him from a mistranscription in the CK in art. فل: see فِلِّيَّةٌ in that
art.]
الفلَآءُ, like كِسَآء [in measure], means فلآء الشعر,
[evidently, I think, فِلَآءُ الشَّعَرَ, or the first word
may be a mistranscription for فَلْىُ,] i. e. اخذك ما
فيه [lit. Thy taking what is in it, in which “ it ”
refers to the شعر: app. a euphemism for the taking
of lice from the hair: if so, it may be an inf. n.,
like فَلْىٌ; (see 1, first sentence;) or it may be a
simple subst., like what here follows]: mentioned
by IAmb, from his companions. (TA.)
فِلَايَةٌ [The act of searching the head for lice;]
the subst. from فَلَى رَأْسَهُ signifying “ he searched
his head for lice. ” (Lth, * T, * K.) [See also the
next preceding paragraph.]
[
فَالٍ act. part. n. of 1: fem. فَالِيَةٌ.] فَالِيَاتٌ and
فَوَالٍ [are pls. of فَالِيَةٌ and] signify Women who
search the head for lice. (T, TA.) See an ex. of
the former pl. in the verse cited in the first paragraph. ―
-b2-  فَالِيَةُ الأَفَاعِى (in which the former word
is a pl. [in meaning], M, TA) signifies [lit. The
lousers of the vipers; meaning,] accord. to the A,
certain species of the kind [of beetles] called خَنَافِس
[pl. of خُنْفَسَآء], speckled, found at the holes of the
serpents, which they louse: (TA:) or a certain
خنفسآء, speckled (M, K) with [the colour termed]
صُحْمَة, which is found at the holes [of serpents &c.],
and is the mistress of خَنَافِس; (M;) which is
familiar with scorpions and serpents; so that
when it comes forth from a hole [thereof], it makes
known their existence [therein]: (K:) or certain
small things like خنَافس, speckled; which are
familiar with scorpions and serpents; so that when
they are seen in the hole [thereof] it is known that
behind them are scorpions and serpents: (T:) or
certain insects (دَوَابُّ) that are found at the holes
of the [lizards called] ضِبَاب [pl. of ضَبُّ]; so that
when they come forth, it is known that the ضَبّ is
coming forth inevitably. (M.) Hence one says,
اتتكم فَالِيَةُ الأَفَاعِى, (IAar, T, M, K, *) meaning
(assumed tropical:)  The beginning of evil to be looked for [has come
to you], (IAar, T,) or the beginnings of evil [hare
come to you]; (K;) which is a prov. (IAar, T.)
―
-b3-  And [hence] اِبْنُ الفَوَالِى means The جَانّ; i. e.
the serpent [so called]. (T in art. بنى.)
فَالِيَةٌ [fem. of فَالٍ, q. v. ―
-b2-  And also] A knife.
(T.)
