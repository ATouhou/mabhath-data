فرسكفِرْسِكٌ (S, O, K) [and فِرْسِقٌ (K in art. فرسق)
The peach: or the sort thereof called the nectarine: from the Greek persikh\ or persiko\n; the
malum Persicum, which is generally applied to
the former fruit; or amydalus Persica of Linn.,
(so in Forskål's Flora Aegypt. Arab. p. cxiii.,)
which is applied to both of the fruits above mentioned: i. e.] the [fruit called] خَوْخ; (K, TA;)
of the dial. of El-Yemen: (TA:) or a sort thereof,
(K,) i. q. فِرْسِقٌ, which is like the خَوْخ in size,
(Lth, O,) أَجْرَدُ [which here means without down,
and for which Golius and Freytag appear to
have read أَجْوَدُ], smooth, red [accord. to the CK
“ or red ”], (Lth, O, K, TA,) and yellow, the
flavour of which is like that of the خَوْخ: (Lth,
O, TA:) or [a cling-stone peach or nectarine; i. e.]
a sort of خَوْخ that does not cleave asunder from
its stone: (S, O:) or [a free-stone peach or nectarine; i. e.] such as cleaves asunder from its
stone. (K.)
