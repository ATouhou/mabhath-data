فأر1
فَئِرَ, aor. يَفْأَرُ, It (a place) became abundant
in فَأْر [i. e. rats, or mice]. (Msb.)
-A2-  فَأَرَ, (J, O,)
aor. as above, (K,) inf. n. فَأْرٌ, (TK,) He dug;
(K;) or dug as does the فَأْر [i. e. rat, or mouse]:
(M, TA:) and, (K,) as some say, (M, TA,) he
buried, and hid. (M, * O, K, TA.)
فَأْرٌ [A kind of animal,] well known, (M, K,) [the
genus mus; the rat; the mouse; and the like];
with ء, (Lth, S, Msb,) and without ء; (Msb;)
[a coll. gen. n.:] n. un. with ة: (Lth, T:) [in the
S and O and Msb, فَأْرٌ is said to be pl. of فَأْرَةٌ, but
in the last is added, like تَمْرَةٌ and تَمْرٌ, showing
that by pl. is meant coll. gen. n.:] the pl. of فأر,
(Lth, T, M, K,) or of فأرة, (O, Msb,) is فِئْرَانٌ
(Lth, T, M, O, K, Msb) and فِئِرَةٌ: (M, K:) accord.
to IAar, (T, TA,) ↓ فُؤَرٌ, like صُرَدٌ, (O, K, TA,)
is applied to the male: (T, O, K, TA:) but this
last word occurs in the phrase الفَأْر الفُؤَر, [in
which الفأر is evidently used in a sense mentioned
below, namely, “the muscles,” as is indicated in
the T and O,] and, accord. to some, [الفُؤَر is a
corroborative epithet, for they say that] this
phrase is like لَيْلٌ لَائِلٌ and يَوْمٌ أَيْوَمُ: (O:) فَأْرَةٌ
is applied [accord. to some] to the female; (M;)
or [more correctly] to the male and the female,
(M, K,) like as حَمَامَةٌ is applied to the male and
the female of the [genus] حَمَام. (M, TA.) ―
-b2-
Also Musk: (M, K:) this is sometimes called
فَأْرٌ because it is from the [animal, or from a kind
of animal, called] فَأْر, as some say. (M.) ―
-b3-
And فَأْرَةُ المِسْكِ signifies The bag, follicle, or
vesicle, (نَافِجَة, S, M, O, K, or نَافِقَة, T,) of musk:
(T, S, M, O, K:) and is also without ء; (M,
Msb;) or it should correctly be mentioned in
art. فور, [as being called فَارَةٌ] because of the
spreading (فَوَرَان) of its odour: or it may be with
ء because it has the appearance, or form, of the
[animal called] فَأْرَة. (O, K.) It was said to an
Arab of the desert أَتَهْمِزُ الفَأْرَةَ, (K, TA, in the
CK أَتُهْمَزُ الفَأْرُ,) [meaning Dost thou pronounce
فارة with hemz?], and he replied, [understanding
the animal so called to be meant,] الهِرَّةُ تَهْمِزُهَا,
(K,) meaning, [The cat] bites it. (TA.) ―
-b4-
[Hence, app., by a synecdoche, فَأْرَةُ المِسْكِ is
applied to The mush-animal, or Tibet-musk;
moschus moschiferus:] El-Jáhidh says, I asked
a perfumer, of [the sect of] the Moatezileh, respecting [the animal called] فأرة المسك, and he
said, it is not a mouse, or rat, (فأرة,) but is more
like a young gazelle: it is found in the region of
Tubbat [or Tibet]; and is hunted; and the man
who catches it binds tightly its navel, [or rather
its umbilical follicle,] which being pendent, the
blood collects in it; then it is slaughtered; and
when it is quiet, he cuts out the bound navel, and
buries it in barley (شعير) until the congealed
blood becomes converted into strong-scented musk.
(TA.) ―
-b5-  And فَأْرَةُ الإِبِلِ signifies The sweet odour
of the camels, [likened to that of the vesicle of
musk,] which diffuses itself from them when they
have pastured upon the herbs and their blossoms,
(S, O,) or, as some say, upon the [plant called]
خُزَامَى [q. v.], (O,) and then drunk, and returned
from the water, with their skins moist: (S, O:)
so says Yaakoob. (S.) Thus in a verse cited
voce ذَفِرٌ. (S, O. [Therefore فَأْرَةٌ ذَفْرَآءُ should
there be rendered A pungent sweet odour like
that of a vesicle of musk. But see فَارَة, in art.
فور.])
-A2-  الفَأْرُ signifies also (assumed tropical:)  The muscles: (T,
O:) and فَأْرُ المَتْنِ (assumed tropical:)  the flesh on either side of the
back-bone; as also يَرَابِيعُ المَتْنِ. (T. [See also
