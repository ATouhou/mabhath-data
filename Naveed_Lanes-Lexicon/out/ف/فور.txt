فَوَرَانٌ, The vein became excited, or in a state of
commotion, and flowed forth [with blood]: (M,
K, TA:) to which is added in the K, وَضَرَبَ;
but this is a mistake, occasioned by a false reading of the next words in the M, which are وَضَرْبٌ

as some say, with the same motion with which he
came, not ceasing from motion after it; properly,
conjoining what was before the coming with what

فَوَّارٌ A smiting [that inflicts a wound] such as is
wide, (IAar, M, TA,) so that the blood flows

بِضَرْبٍ يُخَفِّتُ فَوَّارُهُ
وَطَعْنٍ تَرَى الدَّمَ مِنْهُ رَشِيشًا
إِذَا قَتَلُوا مِنْكُمُ فَارِسًا
ضَمِنَّا لَهُ بَعْدَهُ أَنْ يَعِيشَا
(IAar, M, TA. [The text of the M as given in
the TT, for تَرَى الدَّمَ, has يُرى الدم; and for
أَنْ يَعِيشَا, it has او يعيشا: and the right reading of
the first hemistich seems to be, بِضَرْبٍ تُخَفِّتُ فَوَّارَةٍ;
for an inf. n. is sometimes made fem.: see an instance of ضَرْب as fem. in the EM p. 157: the
poet means, With a smiting that silences, or kills,
inflicting a wide and gushing wound; and a piercing with the spear in consequence of which thou
seest the blood sprinkled: when they slay a horseman of you, we are responsible for him after it
that he shall live: i. e., as is said in the M, his
blood shall be revenged, so that he will be as
though he had not been slain: and it is also there
said that by يخفّت فوّاره is meant لنها واسعة فدمها
يسيل ولا صوت له; in which the two fem. pronouns and the fem. epithet all relate to the word
ضَرْب, agreeably with what I have stated to be
in my opinion the right reading of the first hemistich.])
فَيُّورٌ Sharp, as an epithet applied to a man;
syn. حَدِيدٌ. (O, K.) See also طَيُّورٌ.
فَوَّارَةٌ, (accord. to the K,) or ↓ فُوَّارَةٌ, (accord. to
a copy of the M,) A source, or spring, of water:
(M, K:) [the latter word is app. the right in this
case; for] IAar says that ↓ فُوَّارَةٌ is applied to a
wave: and to a بِرْكَة [i. e. watering-trough, or
the like; or basin, pool, pond; &c.]: and فَوَّارَةٌ,
to anything that is not water: and in one place
he says that دَوَّارَةٌ and فَوَّارَةٌ are applied to anything
that does not move nor turn round; and دُوَّارَةٌ and
↓ فُوَّارَةٌ to such as moves and turns round. (T,

↓ فُوَّارَة, (so in a copy of the M,) is an aperture in
the وَرِك [or haunch], to the belly, or interior of
the body, not obstructed by bone: (M, K:) [these
two explanations plainly apply to the sacroischiatic foramen: but what here follows is consistent with what precedes, though somewhat less
clear:] or the فَوَّارَتَانِ, (K,) or ↓ فُوَّارَتَانِ, (accord.
to a copy of the M,) are [two parts, in the region
of the pelvis, described as being] سِكَّتَانِ [a word
which I do not find to have any proper meaning
that would be here apposite, but which seems to be
applied in this case, by a kind of catachresis, to two
parts through which a weapon or the like may pass,]
between [each of] the haunch-bones or hip-bones (بَيْنَ
الوَرِكَيْنِ) and the قُحْقُح [or ischium], towards
the side of the وَرِك [or hip-bone], (M, K,) not
intervening as obstacles in the way to the belly, or
interior of the body; and they are what become
in a state of commotion in the act of walking, or
going along. (M.) [See also الفَائِلُ, in art. فيل]
And accord. to Lth, the term فَوَّارَتَانِ, (O, and so
in a copy of the T,) or ↓ فُوَّارَتَانِ, (so in another
copy of the T,) is applied to Two appertenances
of the كَرِش [or stomach, properly of a ruminant
animal], having within them two small nodous
lumps (غُدَّتَانِ), which latter are not eaten, and
each of which is a piece of flesh in the midst of
red flesh. (T, O.)

places.

-b2-  hence, فَارَ فَائِرُهُ]: see 1,
in two places. ―
-b3-  Applied to a beast, of the equine
and other kinds, Swollen in the sinews; syn. مُنْتَشِرُ
العَصَبِ. (K. [In the TA, this is said to be a
mistake for منتشر الغَضَبِ, and thus I find it to be
written in the L, and in a copy of the M accord.
to the TT: but see what I have said, in the first
paragraph of this art., respecting the phrase above
mentioned.])
-A2-  See also فُورٌ.
مَفَاوِرُ: see فُوَارَةٌ.
