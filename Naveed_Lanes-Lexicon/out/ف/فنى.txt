فنى1
فَنِىَ, (T, S, M, Msb, K, &c.,) aor. يَفْنَى;
(T, M, Msb, K;) and فَنَى, aor. يَفْنَى, (M, K,)
which is extr., mentioned by Kr, and said by
him to be of the dial. of Belhárith Ibn-Kaab;
(M;) the former of the two verbs being that
which is commonly known; (TA;) inf. n. فَنَآءٌ,
(T, S, M, Msb, K, &c.,) which is of both of the
verbs; (TA;) It (i. e. a thing, S, Msb, TA)
passed away and came to an end; vanished away;
became spent, or exhausted; failed entirely;
ceased, perished, or came to nought; or was, or
became, transitory, evanescent, or non-existent;
the inf. n. being syn. with نَفَادٌ; (Aboo-'Alee El-
Kálee, TA;) contr. of بَقَآءٌ; (M, TA;) and the
pret. being syn. with عُدِمَ: (K, TA:) it is said
of every created thing that it is subject to الفَنَآء.
(Msb.) [Hence] دَارُ الفَنَآءِ [The abode of transitoriness, evanescence, or perishableness,] means the
present world. (T in art. دور.) ―
-b2-  And, said of
a man, (T, M, K,) i. e. فَنِىَ, aor. and inf. n. as
above, (M,) (tropical:)  He was, or became, extremely
aged; or old and infirm; syn. هَرِمَ: (M, K:) or
he became on the verge of death by reason of
extreme age or of age and infirmity. (T.)
Lebeed says,
حَبَائِلُهُ مَبْثُوثَةٌ بِسَبِيلهِ
وَيَفْنَى إِذَا مَا أَخْطَأَتْهُ الحَبَائِلُ
(T, M,) meaning [His snares are spread in his
way, and when the snares fail to catch him] he
becomes old and infirm and so dies: (T:) or it
means, when death misses him he becomes old and
infirm. (M.)
3
فاناهُ, (T, S, M, K,) inf. n. مُفَانَاةٌ, (T, TA,)
He (a man, S, M) soothed, or coaxed, him: (AA,
T, S, M, K:) and, (M,) accord. to El-Umawee,
(T, S,) he stilled, or quieted, him. (T, S, M.)
El-Kumeyt says, (S, M,) mentioning anxieties,
(M,)
تُقِيمُهُ تَارَةً وَتُقْعِدُهُ
كَمَ يُفَانِى الشَّمُوسَ قَائِدُهَا
[They rouse him at one time, and at another time
they render him sedate like as her leader soothes,
or coaxes, or like as he stills, or quiets, the refractory mare]. (S, M: in the T, accord. to the TT,
the verse ends with رَائِدُهَا [her pastor], instead of
قَائِدُهَا.) Accord. to IAar, فاناهُ signifies واِجاهُ
[app. a mistranscription for وَاخَاهُ, originally آخَاهُ,
He fraternized with him; or acted with him in a
brotherly manner]. (TA.) [Hence the phrase]
أُفَانِى الأَيَّامَ i. e. أُزَجِّى الزَّمَانَ [meaning I make
the time to pass away easily; as though beguiling
it]. (Har p. 607.) ―
-b2-  And one says, بَنُو فُلَانٍ مَا
يُعَانُونَ مَالَهُمْ وَلَا يُفَانُونَهُ i. e. The sons of such a one
do not tend, or take care of, their cattle, or camels,
or [other] property, and do not manage the same
well. (T.)
4
افناهُ He, or it, caused it, or him, to pass
away and come to an end; to vanish away; to
become spent, or exhausted; to fail entirely; to
cease, perish, or come to nought; he, or it, did
away with, destroyed, or annihilated, it, or him;
(T, S, * M, Msb, * K, TA;) trans. of فَنِىَ. (T, S,
Msb, K.) The saying of a rájiz, (T, TA,) namely,
Abu-n-Nejm, (TA,) describing a pastor of sheep
or goats,
يَقُولُ لَيْتَ اللّٰهَ قَدْ أَفْنَاهَا
(T, TA,) may mean an imprecation against them,
i. e. He says, would that God had destroyed them:
(T:) ―
-b2-  or it means, would that God had made
to grow for them [the plant called] الفَنَى, i. e.
عِنَبُ الثَّعْلَبِ; so that they might have abundance
of milk, and become fat. (T, TA.)
6
تَفَانَوا, (S, K,) or تفانوا قَتْلًا, (M,) They
destroyed one another, (S, M, K,) [or they shared,
one with another, in destruction, (see an ex. in a
verse cited voce دَقَّ,) by slaughter,] in war, or
battle. (S.)
الفَنَى, thus, with ى, in the M, and thus it
should be written accord. to Aboo-'Alee El-Kálee,
in the T and S with ا, and in like manner in the
K, in which it is [mentioned in art. فنو, and]
written without the article ال (فَنًا), and said to
be a pl., of which the sing. is ↓ الفَنَاة, (TA,) [The
plant called] عِنَبُ الثَّعْلَبِ; [see art. ثعلب; and
see also الأَفَانِى, in this art.;] (T, S, M, K;)
whereof one is called ↓ فَنَاةٌ: (S:) or, as some say,
another plant; (T;) [i. e.,] as some say, a species
of trees, or plants, (شَجَرٌ,) having red berries,
(حَبّ), (S,) of which necklaces are made, (S,) or
the unbroken of which are made use of as قَرَارِيط
[meaning carat-weights] with which to weigh,
every berry (حَبَّة) being a قِيرَاط: and some say
that it is a herb that grows in rugged places,
rising from the ground to the height of the
measure of a finger, and less, and depastured by
the cattle. (M.)
فَنَاةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in two
places:
-A2-  and see also art. فنو.
فِنَآءٌ A yard, or an exterior court, i. e. a wide
space, (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) in front, (T, M,
Mgh, Msb, K,) or extending from the sides, (S,
Msb,) of a house: (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K:) pl.
أَفْنِيَةٌ (T, S, M, Msb, K) and فُنِىٌّ: (K:) and ثِنَآءٌ
[q. v.] signifies the same. (T, M.)
فَانٍ part. n. of فَنِىَ [i. e. signifying Passing
away and coming to an end; &c.]. (T.) ―
-b2-  And
(tropical:)  An old man extremely aged, or old and infirm;
(M, * Msb, K, * TA;) so called because of his
nearness to passing away, or perishing: (Msb:)
or an old man whose faculties have entirely failed.
(Mgh.) And فَانِيَةٌ occurs in a trad., applied to a
she-camel, or to camels, as meaning (assumed tropical:)  Advanced in
age. (TA.) ―
-b3-  [فَانٍ فِى اللّٰهِ, in the language of
the mystics, means (assumed tropical:)  Lost in contemplation of
God, and insensible to all else.]
أَفْنَآءٌ مِنَ النَّاسِ is expl. in art. فنو.
الأَفَانِى [without the article أَفَانٍ] is the name of
A species of plant, (T, S, K,) yellow, and red;
(T;) [said to be so called] while fresh and succulent; (S;) accord. to AA, (T,) when it has dried
up, it is called الحَمَاطُ; (S, T;) but this is a
mistake; for الافانى signifies a particular species
of plant by itself, of the herbs, or leguminous
plants, termed ذُكُور, which dries up, and becomes
scattered; whereas the حماط is the حَلبة [a mistranscription for حَلَمَة], and this does not dry up,
because it is of the [kind called] جَنْبَة and عُرْوَة
(T:) the n. un. is أَفَانِيَةٌ, (T, S.) like ثَمَانِيَةٌ [in
measure]. (S.) And it is said to signify also
[The plant called] عِنَبُ الثَّعْلَبِ. (S. [See also
الفَنَى, above.])
مَفْنَاةٌ A land (أَرْضٌ) suitable to those who alight
and abide therein: (K, TA:) it occurs, in a verse
of Keys Ibn-El-'Eyzár El-Hudhalee, with ق, [as
some relate that verse,] but As says that in the
dial. of Hudheyl it is with ف. (TA in art. قنى.)
