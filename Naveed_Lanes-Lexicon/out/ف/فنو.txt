فَنَاةٌ A bull or cow; syn. بَقَرَةٌ; (AA, T, S, M,
K;) [i. e.] a بَقَرَة وَحْشِيَة [or wild bull or cow; an
antelope of the bovine kind]: so says Aboo-'Alee
El-Kálee: (TA:) it occurs in a verse of Lebeed;
and is said, as on the authority of IAar, to be
قَنَاة, with ق: (TA in art. قنو:) pl. فَنَوَاتٌ (AA,
T, S, M, K) and [coll. gen. n.] ↓ فَنًا. (Aboo-
'Alee El-Kálee, TA.)
شَعَرٌ أَفْنَى i. q. فَيْنَانٌ [i. e. Hair having locks
like the branches of trees; or long and beautiful
hair]; (M, K, TA;) [or] meaning long hair.
(TA.) [The fem. of أَفْنَى is فَنْوَآءُ. Hence,] اِمْرَأَةٌ
فَنْوَآءُ A woman having much hair: (IAar, M, K:)
and شَجَرَةٌ فَنْوَآءُ A tree having أَفْنَان [or branches];
(AA, T, S, M;) or a tree having wide shade:

أَفْنَآءٌ مِنَ النَّاسِ means Mixed sorts of men or
people; like أَعْنَآءٌ: and the sings. are [said to be]
فِنْوٌ and عِنْوٌ: (IAar, T:) one says, هُوَ مِنْ أَفْنَآءِ
النَّاسِ when it is not known of whom he is: (S:)
or رَجَلٌ مِنْ أَفْنَآءِ القَبَائِلِ, meaning a man such that
one knows not of what tribe he is: but some hold
that one says only, قَوْمٌ من افنآء القبائل; not رَجُلٌ;
and that there is no sing. of أَفْنَآء: (M in art. فنى:)
accord. to AHeyth, one says, هٰؤُلَآءِ مِنْ أَفْنَآءِ النَّاسِ,
meaning these are of the strangers from this and
that place: but one does not say, speaking of one
person, رَجُلٌ من افنآء الناس: and Umm El-Heythem knew not a sing. of أَفْنَآء. (T in art. فنى.)
