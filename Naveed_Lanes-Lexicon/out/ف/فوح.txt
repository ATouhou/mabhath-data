فوح1
فَاحَ المِسْكُ, (Msb, K,) aor. يَفُوحُ and يَفِيحُ;
(Msb;) or فَاحَتْ رِيحُ المِسْكِ, aor. تَفُوحُ and تَفِيحُ;
(S;) inf. n. فَوْحٌ (S, Msb, K) and فُؤُوحٌ and فَوَحَانُ,
(S, K,) and فَيْحٌ (S, Msb, K) and فَيَحَانٌ; (S, K;)
The musk diffused [or exhaled] its odour; (Msb,
K;) or the odour of the musk diffused itself [or
became exhaled]; and فاح الطِّيبُ the perfume
diffused [or exhaled] its odour; (S;) or this last
signifies the perfume became perceptible; or it
clung and remained; [in a garment or person;]
syn. عَبِقَ: (Msb in art. فيح:) the verb is not
used in relation to a foul, or disagreeable odour
or thing: (S, A, Msb, K:) of such an odour one
says هَبَّتْ: (Msb:) or the former verb is common
to both: (K:) but this assertion is outweighed
[by the other]: (TA:) فَوْخٌ signifies the giving
forth, and exhaling, a sweet, or pleasant, odour:
(KL:) and the perceiving such an odour: Fr
says that فَاحَتْ رِيحُهُ and فَاخَتْ are syn.; but
AZ says the فَوْخٌ is attended by sound. (TA.)
