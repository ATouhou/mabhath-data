فَرَّ, aor.
فَرِ3َ, inf. n. فِرَارً (T, S, M, K, &c.) and
فَرٌ (M, K) and مَفَرٌ (S, M, K) and مَفِرٌ, (K,) or
the last is a n. of place [and of time], (S, M,) He
(a man, T) fled: (T, S:) or he turned away or
aside, to elude, and fled, (M, K, TA,) from a
thing that he feared. (TA.) أَيْنَ الْمَفَرُّ [in the Kur
lxxv. 10] means Whither is the [fleeing or] turning
away &c.? (M, TA:) or it may mean when is the
time thereof? (TA:) and اين المَفِرُّ, another reading,
where is the place of fleeing &c.? (I'Ab, Zj, S, M,
TA,) as also المِفَرُّ, (Zj, K, TA,) which is an instrumental noun used as a noun of place: (K, TA:) but
the first is the common reading. (TA.) ―
-b2-  فَرَّ
مِنْ عَدُوِهِ, aor. as above, inf. n. فَرٌّ, He wheeled
about widely from his enemy, to turn again.
(Msb.) ―
-b3-  And فَرَّ إِلَى الشَّىْءِ He went, or betook
himself, to the thing. (Msb.) ―
-b4-  And [hence]
فَرَّتْ يَدُهُ His arm, or hand, fell off; like طَرَّتْ
and تَرَّتْ. (O.)
-A2-  فَرَّ الفَرَسَ, (S, O,) or الدَّابَّةَ,
(M, K,) aor.
فَرُ3َ, (S, M, O,) i. e. with damm, (O,)
[in copies of the K
فَرِ3َ, but afterwards in those
copies
فَرُ3َ, which is the regular and correct form,]
inf. n. فَرٌّ (S, M, O, K) and فُرَارٌ and فِرَارٌ and فَرَارٌ,
(K,) or فُرَارٌ is a simple subst., and فِرَارٌ is an inf. n.,
(Meyd, in explanation of the prov. which here
follows,) He looked at, or examined, the teeth of
the horse, (S, O,) or he exposed to view the teeth
of the beast that he might see what was its age.
(M, K.) Hence, (TA,)
إِنَّ الجَوَادَ عَيْنُهُ فُرَارُهُ
(S, M, * Meyd, K, *) and فِرَارُهُ, (M, Meyd, K,)
and فَرَارُهُ, (S, K,) sometimes thus pronounced
with fet-h, (S,) (tropical:)  [Verily the fleet and excellent
horse, his aspect (see عَيْنٌ) is (equivalent to) the
examination of his teeth, i. e. he is known by his
aspect], is a prov., applied to him whose external
state indicates his internal qualities; (Meyd, O,
K;) meaning that one knows his excellence from
his عَيْن [i. e. aspect] like as one knows the age
of a beast by examining his teeth; (TA;) his
external appearance rendering it needless for thee
to test him, (S, Meyd, O, K,) and to examine
(أَنْ تَفُرَّ) his teeth: (S, O, K:) and [with the
same meaning] one says, فَرُّ الجَوَادِ عَيْنُهُ: (A, TA:)
and [in like manner] الخَبِيثُ عَينُهُ فُرِاَرُهُ [The bad,
his aspect &c.]; (Meyd, O, TA;) i. e. thou knowest his badness by his عَيْن when thou seest him.
(TA.) And one says also, فَرَرْتُ فَمَ الفَرَسِ I
opened the mouth of the horse that I might know
his age. (Har p. 28.) And فَرَّ عَنْ أَسْنَانِ الدَّابَّةِ,
aor.
فَرِ3َ, He examined the teeth of the beast. (Har
p. 233.) ―
-b2-  [Hence the saying of El-Hajjáj, فُرِرْتُ
عَنْ ذَكَآءٍ, expl. in art. ذكو.] And [hence also]
one says, فَرَّهُ عَنْ أَشْيَآءِ (tropical:)  He examined him respecting things (O, * TA.) And فَرَّ الأَمْرَ, (M, TA,)
and فَرَّ عَنِ الأَمْرِ, (S, M, O, K, TA,) (tropical:)  He examined, looked into, scrutinized, or investigated, the
affair; searched into it; inquired, or sought information, respecting it. (S, M, O, K, TA.) And
فَرَّ فُلَانٌ عَمَّا فِى نَفْسِى (tropical:)  Such a one interrogated me
in order that he might know, from what I should
say, what was in my mind. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And فُرَّ الأَمْرُ
جَذَعًا (assumed tropical:)  The thing returned to its first state; it
recommenced. (M, O, K.) And فُرَّ الأَمْرَ جَذَعًا
(assumed tropical:)  Commence thou the affair from the first thereof.
(M, in the TT. [But the MS. has in this case,
as in that here immediately preceding, الامرُ: the
right reading is evidently الامرَ; as in a similar
phrase voce جَذَعٌ, q. v.])
-A3-  فَرَّ, aor. يَفِرُّ or يَفَرُّ,
(accord. to different copies of the T,) He became
intelligent after being weak [in mind]. (IAar, T,
TA.)
3
فَارَرْتُهُ, inf. n. مُفَارَّةٌ, (tropical:)  I investigated his state,
or condition, he investigating mine. (TA.)
4
افرّهُ He, or it, made him to flee; (S, O;)
or made him to turn away or aside, for the purpose of eluding, and to flee: (M, K:) or (O) he
did to him a deed that made him to flee; (Fr, AO,
T, M, O, K;) as also افرّبِهِ. (TA.) It is related
in a trad. that the Prophet said to 'Adee the son
of Hátim, مَا يُفِرُّكَ عَنِ الإِسْلَامِ إِلّا أَنْ يُقَالَ لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا
اللّٰهُ (T, M, O, TA) i. e. Nothing induces thee to
flee from El-Islám except the saying “ There is
no deity but God: ” many of the relaters say
يَفُرُّكَ; but Az says that the former is the right.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  Hence the saying, افرّاللّٰهُ يَدَهُ God
made, or may God make, his arm, or hand, to
fall off; like أَطَرَّهَا and أَتَرَّهَا. (O.) ―
-b3-  And
أَفْرَرْتُ رَأْسَهُ I split, or clave, his head, with a
sword; like أَفْرَيْتُهُ. (Yz, T, O, K.)
-A2-  أَفَرَّتْ
لِلْإِثْنَآءِ, said of camels, (S, M, O, K,) and of
horses, (M, K,) They shed their milk-teeth and
had others come forth. (S, M, O, K.)
5
تَفَرَّرَ بِى i. q. ضَحِكَ [He laughed at me,
derided me, or ridiculed me]; (K, TA;) mentioned by Sgh. (TA.)
6
تفارّوا They fled, one from another. (S,
O, K.)
8
افترّ He laughed in a beautiful manner, (M,
K,) beyond what is termed اِنْكِلَال [inf. n. of اِنْكَلَّ,
q. v.]. (M.) One says, افترَّ ضَاحِكًا He showed his
teeth laughing; (S;) as also افتر عَنْ ثَغْرِهِ. (T.) It
is said of the Prophet, الغَمَامِ وَ يَفْتَرُّ عَنْ مِثْلِ حَبِّ
meaning And he used to smile so as to show teeth
the like of hail-stones, without a reiterated, or a
loud, laughing. (T.) ―
-b2-  Hence, (TA,) افترّ البَرْقُ
(assumed tropical:)  The lightning glistened. (M, K.) And hence
the saying, الصَّرْفَهُ نَابُ الدَّهْرِ الَّذِى يَفْتَرُّ عَنْهُ [Es-
Sarfeh is the dog-tooth of time, or fortune, which
it shows smiling]: for when Es-Sarfeh [which is
the Twelfth Mansion of the Moon] rises, [but it
should be, when it sets, aurorally, for it so set, in
Central Arabia, about the commencement of the
era of the Flight, on the 9th of March, O. S.,]
the blossoms come forth and the herbage attains
its full height. (M, L. [See more in art. صرف.])
―
-b3-  See also فُرٌّ.
-A2-  Also He snuffed up a thing
into his nose. (M, K.)
R. Q. 1

(M,) or فِرْفَارٌ, (TA,) He put in a state of motion,
commotion, or agitation; shook; or shook about;
(S, M, K;) it, (S, K,) or him. (M.) One says
of a horse, يُفَرْفِرُ اللِّجَامَ فِى فِيهِ He puts in a state
of motion, &c., the bit in his mouth. (M. [See
also an explanation of the verb as intrans., in
what follows.]) ―
-b2-  He broke it, i. e. a thing.
(M, K.) ―
-b3-  He cut it. (K.) ―
-b4-  He clave, split,
slit, rent, or tore, it. (TA.) [Thus] فَرْفَرَ signifies
He rent, or tore, [skins such as are termed] زِقَاق
[pl. of زِقٌّ], and other things; (O, K, TA;) and
slit, or rent, them much. (TA. [In two copies
of the T, instead of الزِّقَاقَ وَغَيْرَهَا, the reading in
the O and K and TA, I find الرُقاقَ وغيره.]) ―
-b5-
[He mangled it.] One says, الذِّئْبُ يُفَرْفِرُ الشَّاةَ
The wolf mangles the sheep, or goat. (O, * TA.)
―
-b6-  And, (O, K, TA,) hence, (O,) inf. n. فَرْفَرَةٌ,
(TA,) (assumed tropical:)  He defamed him, and mangled his reputation. (O, K, TA.) ―
-b7-  And (assumed tropical:)  He discommended
it, [as though] mangling it with discommendation:
the verb occurs in this sense in a trad., having
for its object الدُّنْيَا [meaning the enjoyments, or
good, of the present world]. (TA.) ―
-b8-  Also, (inf. n.
فَرْفَرَةٌ, TA,) He called or cried, or called out or
cried out, to him. (M, K.)

struck his teeth with the فأْس [q. v.] of his bit,

-b3-  He
hastened, or sped, and went with short steps. (M,
O, K.) ―
-b4-  He was light, and unsteady, (S, * M, *
O, * K, TA,) in mind; (TA;) inf. n. فَرْفَرَةٌ. (S,
M, O, TA.) ―
-b5-  He hastened, or was hasty, with
foolishness, or stupidity. (IAar, T, TA.) ―
-b6-  And
He confounded, or confused, and was profuse, فِى
كَلَامِهِ [in his speaking, or talking, or his speech,
or talk]. (M, K.) ―
-b7-  And [app. He talked;
for] الفَرْفَرَةٌ signifies الكَلَامُ [which is often used as
a quasi-inf. n. of كلّم]. (M.)
-A3-  فَرْفَرَ also signifies He made the kind of vehicle called فَرْفَار.
(T, K.) ―
-b2-  And He kindled [a fire] with [wood
of] the species of tree called فَرفَار. (T, K.)
فَرٌّ: see فَارٌّ, in two places.
فُرٌّ [The best, or choice, of men &c.]. One says,
هُوَ فُرٌّ قَوْمِهِ, (O,) or فُرٌّ القَوْمِ, (K,) and ↓ فُرَّتُهُمْ, (O,
K,) He is of the best, or choice, of his people, or
of the people, (O, K,) and of the chief persons
thereof, (O, K, *) who show him smiling (اَلَّذِينَ
عَنْهُ ↓ يَفْتَرُّونَ, perhaps better rendered who withdraw from him so as to render him conspicuous):
(O, K:) or قَوْمِهِ ↓ هُوَفُرَّةٌ he is the best, or choice,
of his people: (T:) and مَالِى ↓ هٰذَا فُرَّةٌ, (T,) or
مَالِهِ, (O,) this is the best, or choice, of my, or his,
property, or camels &c. (T, O.)
فُرَّةٌ and ↓ أُفُرَّةٌ and ↓ أَفُرَّةٌ The beginning, or first
part, of the heat: (T, S, M, O, K:) or they signify, (T, S, M,) or signify also, (O, K,) the
vehemence thereof: (S, M, O, K:) but [Az says,]
the second and third are in my opinion from أَفَرَ,
the أ being the first radical letter: and Ks states
that some change the أ into ع, saying عُفُرَّة and
عَفُرَّة. (T.) شَرٍّمِنْ فُلَانٍ ↓ مَا زَالَ فُلَانٌ فِى أُفُرَّةٍ is
a saying mentioned by Lth, (T, TA,) meaning
[Such a one ceased not to be] in a vehement state

-b3-  See also the next preceding paragraph, in three places.
فِرَّةٌ A smiling: [or rather a manner of smiling:]
one says, إنَّها لَحَسَنَةُ الفِرَّةِ [Verily she is beautiful
in respect of the manner of smiling]. (TA.)
فُرُرٌ: see فُرَارٌ.
فُرَرَةٌ: see فَارٌّ.
فُرَارٌ and ↓ فَريرٌ The young one of the ewe, and
of the she-goat, (M, K,) and of the cow, (M,) or
of the wild cow, (A 'Obeyd, T, S, M, O, K,) as
also, in this last sense, (O, K,) and in the first
and second senses, (K,) ↓ فُرْفُرٌ and ↓ فُرْفُورٌ (O, K)
and ↓ فَرُورٌ and ↓ فُرَافِرٌ: (K:) or they [app. referring to all the foregoing words] signify lambs:
(K: [but see what follows:]) the female is
termed فُرَارَةٌ: (M:) and فُرَارٌ is pl. also; (T, M,
K;) i. e. it is applied to a pl. number as well as
to one; (TA;) it is said to be pl. of ↓ فَرِيرٌ; (T,
S, M, O;) and is of a rare form of pl.; (A 'Obeyd,
S, O, K; *) and it signifies the small in body of
the young ones of the goat-kind; (M;) or ↓ فَرِيرٌ,
as some say, signifies thus: (TA: [but this I
think doubtful:]) this last word is said by IAar
to signify the young one of the wild animal, of the
gazelle and of the bovine kind and the like; and in
one instance he says that it signifies lambs: (M:)
and, (T, A,) as Aboo-l-'Abbás [i. e. Th] states on
the authority of IAar, (T,) فُرَارٌ (T, M) and فُرَارَةٌ
(T) and ↓ فَرِيرٌ (M) and ↓ فُرُرٌ and ↓ فُرْفُورٌ and ↓ فُرَافِرٌ
(T, M) signify the lamb when it is weaned, (T,
M,) and has become what is termed جَفْرٌ [q. v.],
and obtained plenty of herbage, (M,) and has
become fat: (T, M:) accord. to Ibn-'Abbád, (O,)
the last two signify a lamb (حَمَل, O, TA, in the
K جَمَل, a mistranscription, TA) when it eats,
and chews the cud: (O, K: [see also فُرْفُورٌ below:])
and [it is also said that] فُرَارٌ signifies great بَهْم
[app. as meaning lambs or kids], and one thereof
is termed ↓ فُرْفُورٌ. (TA.) It is said in a prov.
نَزْوُ الفُرَارِ اسْتَجْهَلَ الفُرَارَا
[The leaping of the wild calf, or with equal propriety الفرار may be here rendered the kid, excited
to lightness the  other wild calf, or kid]: (T, S, O,
K:) A 'Obeyd says, on the authority of El-Mu-
ärrij, [and so says Meyd, and the same is implied
in the S and O,] that الفرار here means the young
one of the wild cow: (T:) i. e., when the فرار
attains to youthful vigour it takes to leaping,
and when another sees it [do so] it leaps in like
manner: (T, S, K:) the prov. is used in relation
to him of whose companionship one should be
cautious; meaning, if thou become his companion
thou wilt do as he does: (T, O, K:) some relate
it otherwise, saying نَزْوَ, meaning نَزَا نَزْوَ الفُرَارِ.
(O.) [See also a similar prov. in art. سفه, conj. 5.]
فَرُرٌ: see فَارٌّ. It is applied to a woman as
meaning Wont to flee from that which induces
doubt, or suspicion, or evil opinion. (S.) ―
-b2-  See
also the next preceding paragraph.
فَرِيرٌ: see فُرَارٌ, in four places.
-A2-  Also The
place of the محَسَّة [thus in a copy of the M (app.
مِحَسَّة i. e. currycomb, as though meaning the
part that is currycombed), in the K of the مجَسَّة
(i. e. مَجَسَّة, q. v.), and in the O of the مجمّ,
which last I think to be a mistranscription,] of the
مَعْرَفَة [or part, or flesh, upon which grows the
mane] of the horse: (M, O, K:) or the base
(أَصْل) of the مَعْرَفَة of the horse. (T; and accord.
to the TA, mentioned by Sgh, and there said to
be tropical.) ―
-b2-  And The mouth: (O, K, TA:)
mentioned by Z in a manner indicating that it is
of the horse or the like. (TA.)

(M, O, K) and ↓ فَرُورَةٌ (M, K) and ↓ فَرَّارٌ (M, O,
K) and ↓ فُرَرَةٌ (K) are epithets from فَرَّ signifying
as expl. in the first sentence of this art.: (S, T,
M, O, K:) [the first and second meaning Fleeing;
or turning away or aside, to elude, and fleeing:
the third, fifth, and sixth, fleeing, &c., much: and
the fourth, fleeing, &c., very much:] but ↓ فَرٌّ is
applied to one and to two and to more, and to a
female; (S, O;) it has no dual nor pl. [nor fem.
form]; (T;) the sing. [and dual] and pl. [and
mase. and fem.] are alike; (M;) as it is an inf. n.
used as an epithet; (M, O;) and it may be a
pl. [or rather a quasi-pl. n.] of فَارٌّ, (S, M, O,)
like as رَكْبٌ is of رَاكِبٌ, (S, O,) and صَحْبٌ of
صَاحِبٌ, (S, O, K, *) or شَرْبٌ of شَارِبٌ: (M:) it is
related in the trad. respecting the Flight that
Surákah Ibn-Málik, when he saw the Prophet
and Aboo-Bekr fleeing to El-Medeeneh, and they
passed by him, said, هٰذَانِ فَرٌّ قُرَيشٍ أَفَلَا أَرُدُّ عَلَى
قُرَيْشٍ فَرَّهَا, (T, * S, * O, * TA,) meaning [These
two are] the two fugitives [of Kureysh: shall I
not turn back to Kureysh their fugitives?].

A species of tree, (T, M, O, K,) hard, having
much endurance of fire, (T, O,) of which are
made [bowls such as are termed] قِصَاع (M, O, K)
and عِسَاس: (M, O:) AHn says, it is a great
kind of tree; (O;) it becomes tall like the دُلْب
[q. v.]; its leaves are like those of the almondtree; it has blossoms like the red rose; (O, TA;)
and it becomes thick so that great [bowls such as
are termed] عِسَاس, and أَقْدَاح, are turned from
it: (O:) when its tree becomes old, its wood becomes black like ebony: (O, TA:) it is a hard
wood, that blunts iron; and the bowls thereof are
thin and light, and of pleasant odour: small
saddles, called مَخَاصِر, pl. of مِخْصَرَةٌ, for excellent
she-camels, were also made of it, and the curved
pieces of wood (أَحْنَآء) thereof amounted [in price]
to two hundred dirhems. (O.)
-A3-  And A sort of
vehicle, or saddle, for women (T, O, K) and for
pastors, resembling the حَوِيَّة and سَوِيَّة [described
in arts. حوى and سوى]. (T.)
فِرْفَارٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
فُرْفُورٌ: see فُرَارٌ, in three places. [It is said that]
it signifies A fat جَمَل (Thus in copies of the K

has become what is termed جَفْرٌ].) ―

youth, or young man; (O, K, TA;) as being

and ↓ فِرْفِرٌ: (K:) a small عُصفُور [i. e. sparrow, or
passerine bird]: (ISh, T, M:) so it is said: (M:)
and ↓ فُرْفُرٌ signifies the عُصْفُورٌ [in an absolute
sense]; (M, K;) as also فُرْفُورٌ: (K:) accord. to
AHát, Et-Táïfee says that ↓ الفُرْفُرُ, of which the
pl. is الفَرَافِرُ, signifies the نَقَاقِير; thus he says,
[using the pl.,] not the نُقَّار [or نَقَّار? (see عُصْفُورٌ)];
and he adds that sometimes it is said that the
فُرْفُور is the صِرّ [q. v.]; and some say ↓ الفِرْفِرُ,
with kesr, but he says, I am not confident of its
chasteness: (O:) [accord. to Ed-Demeeree, as
stated by Freytag, فُرْفُرٌ is the name of a small
aquatic bird like the dove or pigeon: SM says,
app. relying upon the correctness of a modern
application of the word,] I have seen the فُرْفُور in
Egypt, and it is smaller than the إوَذّ [which is
applied to the goose and sometimes to the duck].
