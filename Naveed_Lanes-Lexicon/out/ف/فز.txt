استفزّهُ It (fear, S, A, O) excited him to

O, K.) وَاسْتَفْزِزْ مَنِ اسْتَطَعتَ مِنْهُمْ بِصَوْتِكَ, in the
Kur [xvii. 66], is expl. by Fr as meaning And
excite thou to lightness and unsteadiness, or unsettle
thou, when thou canst, with thy voice. (O, TA.)
And in like manner, وَإِنْ كَادُوا لَيَسْتَفِزُّونَكَ مِنَ
الأَرْضِ, in the same [xvii. 78], is expl. by him (O,
TA) as meaning, And verily they were near to
unsettling thee from the land: (TA:) but some
say the meaning is, they were near to frightening
thee so as to excite thee to promptness of flight
from the land. (O, TA.) And استفزّهُ عَنْ رَأْيِهِ
He incited him, or excited him, to ignorance,
foolishness, or wrong conduct, and levity, or unsteadiness, so as to make him swerve from his right
sentiment, opinion, or judgment; like اِسْتَخَفَّهُ عن
رأيه. (Az and TA in art. خف.) ―
-b2-  He incited
him, or excited him, to be promptly obedient and
submissive to him and to that which he desired of

-b3-  He
expelled him (Jel in xvii. 105, and K) from the
land, (Jel,) or from his abode, and disturbed, or
disquieted, or unsettled, him, (K,) so as to excite
him to lightness and unsteadiness. (TA.) [See
also 1, latter half.] ―
-b4-  He, or it, deceived him, or
beguiled him, so as to cast him into destruction.
(TA.) ―
-b5-  He slew him: so the verb is expl. by
some in the Kur xvii. 78, quoted above. (TA.)
فَزٌّ A light, or an active, man. (S, A, O, K.)
―
-b2-  And The offspring of the cow; (S;) [meaning,] of the wild cow: (O, K:) because of its
restlessness: (TA:) pl. أَفْزَازٌ. (S, O, K.)
فَزَّةٌ A leap with disquietude [or fright]. (TA.)
قَعَدَ مُسْتَفَزًّا [so in a copy of the S, but without
the vowel-signs: in two other copies of the same,
مُسْتَوْفِزًا, which belongs to art. وفز:] He sat in an
uneasy posture. (S.) ―
-b2-  فَرَسٌ مُسْتَفِزٌّ لِلْوَثْبِ وَالعَدْوِ
[so in two copies of the S, in art. طمر; in the O,
in that art., مُسْتَفِزُّ الوَثْبِ وَالعَدْوِ; probably a
mistake for مُسْتَفَزّ; app. meaning, A horse in a
state of excitement to leap and run.]
