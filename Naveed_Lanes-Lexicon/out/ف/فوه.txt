فوه1
فَاهَ بِهِ, (S, Msb, K,) aor. يَفُوهُ (S, Msb) and
يَفِيهُ also, (ISd, TA,) inf. n. فَوْهٌ, (MA,) [and
inf. n. of unity فَوْهَةٌ, (see Har p. 434,)] He uttered it, or pronounced it, (S, Msb, K,) namely,
a saying; (S;) as also ↓ تفوّه. (S, K.) One says,
مَا فُهْتُ بِكَلِمَةٍ, and ↓ ما تَفَوَّهْتُ, i. e. I opened not
my mouth with a word, or sentence. (S.) فَاهَ لِسَانٌ,
a phrase used by El-Hareeree, the Arabs did not
say: they only said, فاه الرَّجُلُ بِكَذَا [The man
opened his mouth with such a thing, i. e., with such
a saying, &c.]. (Har p. 191.) And هٰذَا أَمْرٌ مَا
فُهْتُ عَنْهُ, inf. n. فُوُوهٌ [or فُؤُوهٌ ?], is a saying mentioned by Fr, as meaning This is a thing, or an
affair, which I mentioned not, or have not mentioned. (TA.) ―
-b2-  See also 2.
-A2-  فَوِهَ, aor. يَفْوَهُ,
[inf. n. فَوَهٌ,] He (a man) had what is termed
↓ فَوَهٌ, (S, TA,) which means width of the mouth,
(S, K, TA,) and largeness thereof: (TA:) or
protrusion and length of the upper central incisors:
(S, TA:) or length of all the teeth; length of the
upper central incisors being termed رَوَقٌ: (IB,
TA:) or protrusion of the teeth from the lips,
with length thereof. (K, TA.)
2
فوّههُ He (i. e. God) made him to be أَفْوَه [or
wide in the mouth, &c.]. (S, K.) ―
-b2-  شَدَّ مَا فَوَّهْتَ
فِى هٰذَا الطَّعَامِ, [thus accord. to the TA, but an
explanation of مُفَوَّهٌ seems to show that the right
reading is فُوِّهْتَ, in the pass. form,] and ↓ تَفَوَّهْتَ,
and ↓ فُهْتَ, means شَدَّ مَا أَكَلْتَ [app. Much
indeed, or greatly indeed, didst thou eat, or hast
thou eaten, of this food; see شَدَّ: and see also
10]. (TA.)
3
فاوههُ, (K, TA,) inf. n. مُفَاوَهَةٌ; (TA;) and
فَاهَاهُ, [formed from the former by transposition,]
(K, TA,) inf. n. مُفَاهَاةٌ; (TA;) He talked, or
discoursed, with him: [see also 6:] and he contended with him for superiority in glory, or excellence. (K, TA.)
5
تفوّه He spoke. (KL.) See also 1, first and
second sentences. ―
-b2-  And see 2.
-A2-  تفوّه المَكَانَ
(assumed tropical:)  He entered the فُوَّهَة of the place; (K, TA;)
i. e., the mouth thereof; likened to the فَم [properly thus called] as being the first place of ingress
to the interior thereof. (TA.)
6
تفاوهوا They talked [app. one to another: see
3]. (K.)
10
استفاه, (S, K,) inf. n. اِسْتِفَاهَةٌ and اِسْتِفَاهٌ,
(K,) the latter mentioned by Lh, (TA,) He (a
man, S) ate, (S, K,) or drank, (K,) vehemently,
after scantiness, (S, K,) or after weakness; (so in
a copy of the S;) but seldom used in relation to
drinking: or you say, استفاه فِى الطَّعَامِ, meaning
he ate much of the food: so says IAar, not particularizing the act as being after scarcity or not.
(TA.) [See also 2.] ―
-b2-  And He quenched his
thirst by drinking. (K.)
فَاهٌ: see what next follows: and see the next
paragraph again, in the latter half:
-A2-  and the
same word, and فَاهٍ, (the latter in two places,) see
voce فَاوُوهَةٌ.
فُوهٌ and ↓ فَاهٌ and ↓ فِيهٌ (K, TA) and, accord. to
the copies of the K, فُوهَةٌ, [or, as in the CK, فَوْهَة,]
but correctly ↓ فُوَّهَةٌ, (TA,) and فَمٌ, all signify the
same [i. e. The mouth]: (K, TA:) the pl. is أَفْوَاهٌ,
(S, K, TA,) pl. of فُوهٌ, (S, TA,) and as such its
case is plain; as pl. of فِيهٌ, it is like أَرْوَاحٌ as pl.
of رِيحٌ; as pl of فَاهٌ, it is allowable as having و
for its original medial radical; but as pl. of فُوَّهَةٌ,
it is anomalous: (TA:) and another pl. is أَفْمَامٌ,
(K, TA,) said by some to be pl. of فُمٌّ or فَمٌّ, with
teshdeed, of which an ex. occurs in a verse cited
in the first paragraph of art. فم; but some disallow this pl.; and accord. to some, (TA,) it has
no sing. (K, TA) agreeable with rule, (TA,) for
فَمٌ is originally فَوَهٌ, (K, TA,) with the و movent
by fet-h, or [فَوْهٌ, as in some copies of the S,] with
the و quiescent, on the authority of IJ; (TA;)
the ه is elided, and the و becomes a movent final,
therefore it must be changed into ا, because of
the fet-hah preceding it, so the word becomes فا;
but a noun may not be of two letters whereof one
is [the ن of] the tenween, (K, TA,) thus the passage is expressed in the M, but MF remarks that
correctly we should say whereof one is the ا, (TA,)
and therefore a hard letter is substituted for it,
one similar to it in kind, which is م, for they are
both labials, and in the م is a sort of humming
sound (هَوِىٌّ, in the CK هُوِىٌّ,) in the mouth, [or
rather in the nose,] resembling [the sound of] the
prolongation of the و: (K, TA:) [several similar
disquisitions, added in the TA, respecting the
change from فوه to فم, I omit, regarding them as
needless: what is said on this subject in the S,
in art. فم, I have mentioned in that art.:] in the
present art., J says that the م of فم is a substitute for the ه, not for the و, of فوه; but this is a
mistake: (IB, TA:) the dual of فَمٌ is فَمَانِ and
فَمَوَانِ (IAar, S, Msb, K) and فَمَيَانِ, the second
and third of which are anomalous: (IAar, K:)
of the second, which occurs in a verse of ElFarezdak, [and respecting which see the first
paragraph of art. فم,] Sb says that it is used by
poetic license. (TA.) In using it as a prefixed
noun, in the phrase هٰذَا فُوهُهُ, they deemed the
combination of the two هs difficult in respect of
utterance; therefore they suppressed the [radical]
ه thereof [in this case, and then in other, similar,
cases], and said, هٰذَا فُوهُ, and فُو زَيْدٍ, and رَأَيْتُ فَا
زَيْدٍ, and مَرَرْتُ بِفِى زَيْدٍ: and when prefixing it
to [the pronoun denoting] thyself, thou sayest,
هٰذَا فِىَّ; and this thou dost alike in using it in
the nom. case and in the accus. and in the gen.,
because the و [of فُو] is changed into ى and is
then incorporated [into the pronominal ى]: (S,
and the like is said in the Msb:) and sometimes,
though rarely, they did the like in other cases,
when not prefixing it; for instance, فَا occurs at
the end of a verse of El-'Ajjáj, without an affix,
in this case for فَاهَا. (S.) ―
-b2-  In the saying كَلَّمْتُهُ
فَاهُ إِلَى فِىَّ, meaning I spoke to him, his mouth
being near to my mouth, فاه is in the accus. case
as a denotative of state: (S, TA: *) or by reason
of the derivative [مُكَلِّمًا] meant to be understood:
or, as Sb says, it is an instance of one of the
nouns that are put in the place of inf. ns., and it
is not to be separated from what should follow it,
so that you may not say كَلَّمْتُهُ فَاهَ [alone], for
you tell of your nearness to the person, and that
there is not any one between you and him: and
if you will, you may use the nom. case, meaning
وَهٰذِهِ حَالُهُ [this being his state], (Sb, TA,) i. e.
فُوهُ إِلَى فِىَّ [his mouth was near to my mouth],
the clause [following كلّمته] occupying the place
of a denotative of state. (TA.) ―
-b3-  The saying
فَاهَا لِفِيكَ, (Meyd, K, TA,) which is a prov.,
(Meyd, TA,) means May God make the mouth of
misfortune to cleave to thy mouth; (Meyd, K, *
TA;) [but lit. signifies, only, her, or its, mouth
to thy mouth; and is [likewise] an instance of
one of the nouns that are used in the manner of
inf. ns. expressive of imprecation, by reason of a
verb not mentioned: Sb says, فاها is without tenween, meaning فَا الدَّاهِيَةِ, as is shown by the
saying,
وَدَاهِيَةٍ مِنْ دَوَاهِى المَنُو
نِ يَرْهَبُهَا النَّاسُ لَا فَا لَهَا
[Many a misfortune is there, of the misfortunes of
time, which men fear, that has no mouth, wherewith to bite]: (Sb, TA:) A'Obeyd says that its
primary meaning is, may God make the ground
to be in thy mouth; that it is like the sayings
بِفِيكَ الحَجَرُ and بِفِيكَ الأَثْلَبُ; (S, Meyd;) and
[hence] it means disappointment [cleave] to thee:
(S, * Meyd:) a man of Belhujeym, (S, Meyd,)
cited by A'Obeyd, (S,) addressing a wolf that
sought to get his she-camel, (Meyd,) says,
فَقُلْتُ لَهُ فَاهَا لِفِيكَ فَإِنَّهَا
قَلُوصُ امْرِئٍ قَارِيكَ مَا أَنْتَ حَاذِرُهُ
[And I said to him, فاها لفيك, for she is the
youthful she-camel of a man who will give thee as
a guest's entertainment that which thou fearest];
(S, Meyd; but in the S, as IB has observed,
فَإِنَّهُ is erroneously put for فَإِنَّهَا;) i. e. [who will
entertain thee with] the shooting of arrows;
(Meyd;) [by قَارِيكَ] he means يَقْرِيكَ, from قِرَى
الضَّيْفِ: (S:) it is also said that فَاهَا is metonymically used as meaning the dust of the earth,
which is termed the mouth of the earth because
it drinks the water; and it is as though the saying
meant the dust be in thy mouth: (Meyd:) Sh is
related to have said, I heard IAar say لِفِيكَ ↓ فَاهًا,
with tenween, meaning may God make thy mouth
to cleave to the ground; [or rather, ground to thy
mouth; lit., simply, a mouth to thy mouth;] and
some say فَاهَا لِفِيكَ, without tenween, as an imprecation meaning (assumed tropical:)  may God break thy فَم [i. e.
thy teeth, to which فَم is often metonymically applied, as is also فُوه]. (TA.) ―
-b4-  One says also,
سَقَى فُلَانٌ إِبِلَهُ عَلَى أَفْوَاهِهَا, meaning (tropical:)  Such a one
drew for his camels the water when they came to
it, while they were drinking; not having stored it
for them in the drinking-trough: and جَرَّ فُلَانٌ
إِبِلَهُ عَلَى أَفْوَاهِهَا (tropical:)  Such a one suffered his camels
to pasture while going along [by his driving them
gently: see art. جر]: so says As: and so accord.
to the A and other lexicons; but the author of the
K, by an omission, has assigned the latter explanation to the former phrase. (TA.) ―
-b5-  لَوْ وَجَدْتُ
إِلَيْهِ فَا كَرِشٍ, meaning أَدْنَى طَرِيقٍ, (K, TA,) has
[with other, similar, phrases] been explained in
art. كرش [q. v.]. (TA.) ―
-b6-  فُو فَرَسٍ حَمِرٍ [Mouth
of a horse that is suffering indigestion in consequence of his having eaten barley and so made it
to stink] is an appellation applied to him who has
stinking breath. (TA. [An ex. of it occurs in a
verse of Imra-el-keys cited in the TA in art. حمر
as in Ahlwardt's “ Divans of the Six Ancient
Arabic Poets,” p. 125; and differently in De
Slane's “ Diwan d'Amro-'kaïs,” p. 36 of the Arabic
text.]) ―
-b7-  And فُو جُرَدٍ [Mouth of a large fieldrat] and فُو دَبًا [Mouth of a sort of small wingless
locust, or perhaps correctly فُو دَبَاةٍ mouth of a
small wingless locust,] are nicknames applied to a
little man. (TA.) ―
-b8-  One says also, لَا فُضُّ فُوهُ,
meaning (tropical:)  May his teeth, or front teeth, not be
broken. (K, * TA.) And سَقَطَ فُوهُ (assumed tropical:)  His teeth fell
out. (TA in art. فض [q. v.]) ―
-b9-  And مَاتَ لِفِيهِ
i. e. لِوَجْهِهِ [meaning (tropical:)  He died upon his face;
prone: like سَقَطَ لِوَجْهِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He fell upon his face:
the ل in both being used in the sense of عَلَى; as
it is in the phrase خَرُّوا لِأَذْقَانِهِمْ (expl. in art. خر),
&c.]. (A, K, TA. [The explanation in the TK,
being somewhat ambiguous (though correct), has
misled Freytag in this case.]) And [in like
manner, using لِ in the sense of على,] كبَّهُ اللّٰهُ
لِفِيهِ, one of their forms of imprecation, meaning
(assumed tropical:)  May God cause him to die: or prostrate him
[upon his face; as also كَبَّهُ لِوَجْهِهِ]. (TA.) ―
-b10-
[See also فُوَّهَةٌ as syn. with فُوهٌ; like which it has
أَفْوَاهٌ for a pl.]
-A2-  فُوهٌ also, having for its pl. أَفْوَاهٌ,
and pl. pl. أَفَاوِيهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) [which last
is of very frequent occurrence,] signifies Perfume,
or an odoriferous substance: (Mgh, Msb:) or a
thing, or substance, with which a perfume, or an
odoriferous substance, is compounded or prepared
(يُعَالَجُ); like as تَوَابِلُ signifies things, or substances, with which sorts of food are compounded
or prepared: (S, Mgh:) or the تَوَابِل [or seeds
used in cooking] with which food is compounded
or prepared (يُعَالَجُ) are also called أَفْوَاهُ الطِّيبِ:
(Msb:) [the pl. and pl. pl. are now generally applied to spices, or aromatics:] or الأَفْوَاهُ, the pl.
mentioned above, signifies [the seeds called] التَّوَابِلُ:
and also what diffuse fragrance [I read نَوَافِحُ, as
in my MS. copy of the K, pl. of نَافِحٌ, q. v.,
instead of نَوَافِجُ (with جِيم), the only reading
that I find in other copies of the K, regarding
the latter as indubitably a mistranscription,] of
perfumes, or odoriferous substances: (K:) and
the sorts, or species, of flowers; (K, TA;) thus
says AHn; and in one place he says that الافواح
signifies what are prepared for perfume, of sweetsmelling flowers; and sometimes they are of herbs,
or leguminous plants: (TA:) and also sorts, or
species, of a thing [app. of any kind]: (K:) and
one says, هُوَ مِنْ أَفْوَاهِ الطيب, and أَفْوَاهِ البُقُولِ,
meaning It is of the sorts, or species, and of the
mixtures, or compounds, of perfume, and of herbs,
or leguminous plants: (Mgh:) but فُوهٌ is not applied to anything that is termed عَقَّارٌ. (AHeyth,
TA in art. عقر.)
فَوَهٌ: see 1, last sentence. ―
-b2-  Also The quality
of a مَحَالَة [or large sheave of a pulley] such as is
termed فَوْهَآء, fem. of أَفْوَهُ, q. v. (TA.)
فِيهِ: see its syn. فُوهٌ.
فُوهَةٌ: see فُوَّهَةٌ, in five places.
فُوَّهٌ Certain slender, long, red roots, with which
one dyes; beneficial for the liver and the spleen
and the نَسَا [app. as meaning sciatica or the
sciatic nerve] and pain of the hip and of the flank,
powerfully diuretic, and kneaded with vinegar and
applied as a liniment it cures the [leprosy termed]
بَرَص: (K, TA:) but the word was not known
to Az in this sense, [which is the only meaning,
except one which I think doubtful, that I find
assigned to it;] and it is said to be the فُوَّة [which
see in art. فو, i. e. madder]. (TA.)
-A2-  See also
فُوَّهَةٌ.
فَيِّهُ, originally فَيْوِهٌ: see مُفَوَّهٌ.
فُوَّهَةٌ: see its syn. فُوهٌ. ―
-b2-  [Hence] it signifies
also (tropical:)  The فَم [i. e. mouth] of a place; likened to
the فَم [properly so called] as being the first place
of ingress, or entrance, to the interior: (TA:)
[and so too as being the place of egress, or exit,
from the interior:] it is of a river, or rivulet,
(Lth, S, Msb, TA,) and of a valley, or water-course, or torrent-bed, (K, TA,) and of a street,
and of a road; (S, Msb, K, TA;) signifying the
فَم [or mouth]; as also ↓ فُوهَةٌ, (K, TA,) without
teshdeed; mentioned by IAar: (TA:) or it signifies thus in relation to a river, or rivulet; (Lth,
Msb, TA;) the foremost part thereof: or, as
some say, the place of its pouring into the كِظَامَة
[q. v.]: and accord. to Lth, in relation to a
valley, or water-course, or torrent-bed, its رَأْس
[or head, as though in this case having one, or
each, of two contr. meanings, unless, as I believe
it to be, the mouth, or outlet, of a valley or water-course or torrent-bed be sometimes called its رأس
as being its foremost part]: (TA:) and of a
street, it is the place of egress, or exit; (Msb;)
the foremost part thereof: (TA:) and of a road,
it is the فَم [or mouth], which is the upper part
thereof (اعلاه): (Msb: [thus in my copy; but I
think that اعلاه is a mistranscription, in my copy,
for أَوَّلُهُ, and that the correct meaning is therefore
the foremost part thereof, agreeably with what is
said above in relation to a road and to a river or
rivulet:]) but accord. to some, ↓ فُوهَةٌ, without
teshdeed, is not allowable; and one should say,
الطَّرِيقِ قَعَدَ عَلَى فُوَّهَةٍ, and ↓ فُوَّهِهِ [probably, I
think, a mistranscription for فوهِهِ, with the و
quiescent, both meaning He sat at the mouth of
the road]; not ↓ فُوهَتِهِ, without teshdeed: (TA:)
and فُوَّهَةٌ signifies also (assumed tropical:)  the first, or foremost,
part, of a thing; (K, TA;) like that of the
street and that of the river or rivulet: [whence]
one says, طَلَعَ عَلَيْنَا فُوَّهَةُ إِبِلِكَ i. e. (tropical:)  The first, or
foremost, portion of thy camels [came to us, or
came forth upon us]; like the phrase فُوَّهَةُ الطَّرِيقِ:
(TA:) the pl. of فُوَّهَةٌ is أَفْوَاهٌ, (Ks, S, Msb, TA,)
which is anomalous, (S, Msb, TA,) and (TA)
فُوَّهَاتٌ [in the CK فُوْهاتٌ] and فَوَائِهُ. (K, TA.)
[Hence] one says, دَخَلُوا فِى أَفْوَاهِ البَلَدِ وَخَرَجُوا
مِنْ أَرْجُلِهِ, (A, K, * TA,) in the copies of the K
أَرْجُلِهَا, which is wrong, (TA,) i. e. (tropical:)  They entered
into the foremost parts of the country, or town,
and went forth from the hindermost parts thereof:
(A, K, TA:) the sing. of أَفْوَاه as here used is
فُوَّهَةٌ. (TA.)
-A2-  It signifies also A say, or saying, or speech; (S, K, TA;) from 1 in the first
of the senses assigned to it above: hence one says,
إِنَّ رَدَّ الفُوَّهَةِ لَشَدِيدٌ (S, TA) Verily the retracting
of that which has been said is difficult: (Har
p. 434:) and [hence] one says also, هُوَ يَخَافُ
فُوَّهَةَ النَّاسِ [He fears the say, or speech, of men].
(TA.) ―
-b2-  And The Muslims' rending one another's
reputation by evil speech, or by backbiting; (K,
TA;) as also ↓ فُوهَةً. (TA.) ―
-b3-  إِنَّهُ لَذُو فُوَّهَةٍ
means Verily he is strong in speech, and free, or
unconstrained, in tongue. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And one says,
مَا أَشَدَّ فُوَّهَةَ بَعِيرِكَ فِى هٰذَا الكَلَأِ, meaning [How
vehement is] thy camel's eating [of this herbage]!
and in like manner, فُوَّهَةَ فَرَسِكَ [the vehement
eating of thy horse]: whence their saying أَفْوَاهُهَا
مَجَاسُّهَا [which may be well rendered as it has
been in art. جس, q. v.], meaning Their good eating shows thee their fatness, causing thee to be in
no need of feeling them to test their condition.
(TA.)
-A3-  And Milk, as long as there remains in
it the taste of sweetness; (K, * TA;) as also ↓ فُوهَةٌ;
and sometimes correctly said with ق, i. e. [قُوهَةٌ,]
without teshdeed. (TA.)
فَاوُوهَةٌ A man who reveals, or discloses, everything that is in his mind; as also ↓ فَاهٍ, (Fr, S,
TA, [but omitted in one of my copies of the S,])
and ↓ فَاهٌ: (Fr, TA:) and بِجُوعِهِ ↓ فَاهٍ one who
reveals his hunger; originally فَائِهٌ, like as they
said هَارٍ and هَائِرٌ. (TA.)
أَفْوَهُ Having what is termed فَوَهٌ, meaning as
expl. in the last sentence of the first paragraph
[i. e. width of the mouth, &c.]; fem. فَوْهَآءُ; (S,
K, TA;) the former applied to a man, and the
latter to a woman; (S, TA;) and in like manner
to horses. (TA.) فَوْهَآءُ شَوْهَآءُ, applied to a woman,
means Wide-mouthed, ugly: and, applied to a
mare, wide-mouthed, long-headed: or sharp in
spirit. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] بِئْرٌ فَوْهَآءُ A widemouthed well. (K.) ―
-b3-  And طَعْنَةٌ فَوْهَآءُ A wide
wound made by piercing. (K.) ―
-b4-  And مَحَالَةٌ
فَوْهَآءُ [A large sheave of a pulley] (S, K, TA) that
is wide (K, TA) and (TA) whereof the teeth between which runs the well-rope are long. (S, TA.)
[See also مَحَالَةٌ فَوْقَآءُ, in art. فوق.]
مُفَوَّهٌ and ↓ فَيِّهٌ, (S, K,) the latter originally
فَيْوِهٌ, (S,) Eloquent; (S, K, TA;) and so فَيِّهَةٌ
applied to a woman; (S, TA;) able in speech;
an able speaker: or فَيِّهٌ signifies good in speech;
a good speaker: (TA:) or both signify good and
eloquent in speech; as though taken from الفَوَهُ
meaning “ width of the mouth: ” (IAar, TA:)
or having an inordinate desire, or appetite, for
food; a vehement eater; (K, TA;) applied to a
man and to other than man: (TA:) and the
latter (فَيِّهٌ), having an inordinate and insatiable
desire, or appetite, for food: (TA:) and this also
signifies a man who eats much; syn. أَكُولٌ; (S,
K;) and so does ↓ مُسْتَفِيهٌ: (K [in some copies
of which, كوفى is strangely put in the place of
اكول in the explanation here given]:) or ↓ مُسْتَفِيهٌ
signifies a man eating vehemently after scantiness,
(S,) or after weakness: (thus in a copy of the
S:) and مُفَوَّهٌ is also expl. as meaning a man who
eats vehemently. (TA.) And one says مِنْطِيقٌ مُفَوَّهٌ
(K, TA) meaning [Very] eloquent in speech:
(TA:) and مَنْطِقٌ مُفَوَّهٌ (K, TA) Good, or excel-lent, speech, or diction. (TA.)
-A2-  شَرَابٌ مُفَوَّهٌ
means [Beverage, or wine,] perfumed (K, TA.)
