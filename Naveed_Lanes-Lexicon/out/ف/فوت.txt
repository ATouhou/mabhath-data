فَاتَ الأَمْرُ, aor. يَفُوتُ, inf. n. فَوْتٌ and فَوَاتٌ,
originally signifies فَاتَ وَقْتُ فِعْلِهِ [i. e. The time,
or opportunity, of the doing, or performing, of the
affair passed, passed away, elapsed, or escaped,
neglected by him, without his doing it or performing it]; and hence the phrase فَاتَتِ الصَّلَاةُ, meaning The time of prayer passed, passed away,
elapsed, or escaped, without his performing it
therein (Msb:) and ↓ افتات is syn. with فَاتَ.
(M, O.) [And both of these verbs are trans.:]
one says فَاتَهُ الشَّىْءُ, (S, O, Msb,) or الأَمْرُ, (M,
K,) aor. as above, (O,) and so the inf. ns.; (S, *
M, O, * Msb, K;) and ↓ افتاتهُ: (K;) The thing,
(??) affair, passed, or passed away, from him
[neglected by him]; (M, K;) [or the time, or
opportunity, of the doing, or performing, thereof
passed, or passed away from him neglected by
him;] or the thing escaped him, [or became
beyond his reach,] so that he was unable to attain
it, or to do it, or to accomplish it. (Msb.) But
this explanation is not applicable except in the
case of prayer, and the like: in other cases, فَاتَهُ
signifies He, or it, preceded him; was, or became,
or got, before him; outwent him; passed beyond
him; or had, got, or look, precedence of him:
and went, or passed, away from him: and the
like. (MF, TA.) One says, فَاتَنِى كَذَا, meaning سَبَقَنِى [i. e. Such a thing preceded me, &c.,
app. so as to become beyond my reach]: and فُتُّهُ
أَنَا [I preceded it, &c.]: (T:) and جَارَيْتُهُ حَتَّى
فُتُّهُ I ran with him until I passed beyond him, or
outwent him: (A, TA:) and فَاتَهُ فُلَانٌ بِذِرَاعٍ
Such a one preceded him, or outwent him, by a
cubit. (Msb.) فَلَا فَوْتَ, in the Kur xxxiv. 50,
means فَلَا فَوْتَ لَهُمْ مِنًّا [And there shall be for
them no escaping from us], i. e. لَا يَفُوتُونَنَا [they
shall not escape us]. (Jel. [And Bd says the like;
adding, “by flight, or fortifying themselves. ”])
An Arab of the desert is related to have said,
الحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ الَّذِى لا يُفَاتُ وَلَا [expl. in art.
ليت) (T. And they assert that a man went
forth from his family, and when he returned, his
wife said to him, “If thou hadst been present
with us, we would have related to thee what hath
happened; ” whereupon he said to her, لَمْ تُفَاتِى
فَهَاتِى (M, Meyd) i. e. It has not escaped thee [lit.
thou hast not been escaped], so adduce what thou
hast [to tell]: the saying is a proverb. (Meyd.)

-b3-  فَاتَ
is also syn. with فَادَ [as signifying He died; in
which sense the aor. is يَفُوتُ, and the inf. n. فَوْتٌ].
(A in art. فيد.) And ↓ أفْتِيتَ signifies He died
suddenly. (TA in art. فأت, q. v.)
4
افاتهُ الشَّىْءَ, (S, MA,) or الأَمْرَ, (K,) He
made the thing, or affair, to pass, or pass away,
from him [neglected by him; or he made the
time, or opportunity, of the doing, or performing,
thereof to pass, or pass away, from him neglected
by him; or he made the thing to escape him, or
become beyond his reach, so that he was unable to
attain it, or to do it, or to accomplish it: see 1,
second sentence]. (M, A, K.)

تفوّت عَلَيْهِ فِى مَالِهِ means بِهِ ↓ فَاتَهُ, (A 'Obeyd,
T, S, M, O, K,) i. e. He acted exclusively of him,
(M,) [or passed him over], namely, his father,
(A 'Obeyd, T, M, O, *) in respect of his property,
(A 'Obeyd, T, &c.,) i. e. his own property,
(A 'Obeyd, T,) by giving it away, (A 'Obeyd,
T, M, O,) and squandering it, (A 'Obeyd, T, M.)
without consulting him, or asking his permission:
(O, TA:) occurring in a trad., relating to a case
in which the Prophet ordered the father to cause
the property to be restored to his son; and informed him that the son had no right to act thus
to his father. (A 'Obeyd, T, O. *) ―

تفاوت has for its inf. n. تَفَاوُتٌ and تَفَاوَتٌ
and تَفَاوِتٌ, (S, M, O, K,) the second and third
of which are mentioned by AZ; the second is
said by ISk (who mentions this and the third, M)
to be of the dial. of the Kilábees, and the third is
mentioned by El-'Ambaree; both anomalous, for
the inf. n. of a verb of the measure تَفَاعَلَ is تَفَاعُلٌ.
[in the copies of the S يتفاعل, and said to be so
in J's handwriting,] with damm to the ع except
in this instance (S. O:) but Sb said that there
is not among inf. ns. an instance of تَفَاعَلٌ nor of
تَفَاعِلٌ. (M.) مَا تَرَى فِى خَلْقِ الرَّحْمٰنِ مِنْ تَفَاوُتٍ,
(T, M, O, K,) or ↓ تَفَوُّتٍ, (T, O, K.) [the former
in the CK and the latter in other copies of the K,]
the latter being the reading of Hamzeh and Ks,
in the Kur [lxvii. 3], (O,) means Thou seest not
in the creation of the Compassionate, (M, O,) i. e.
in his creation of the heaven, (M,) any incongruity, or discordance; (T, M, O;) or any fault,
defect, or imperfection, so that the beholder might
say, “If it were thus, it were better; ” (T, O, K;)
thus the latter reading is expl. by Es-Suddee; (T,
O, TA;) and Fr says that both readings have
one meaning: (T, TA:) you say of a thing ↓ تفوّت
and تفاوت. (M.) ―
-b2-  And one says, تفاوت الشَّيْآنِ
The two things were far apart, one from the other;
or widely distinct or separated; (S, O, K;) or
differed, or were different. (Msb.) And تَفَاوَتَا
فِى الفَضْلِ They two were distinct, or dissimilar,
in respect of excellence, (Msb,) or فِى الشَّرَفِ [in
eminence, or nobility]. (A.)

وَافْتِيتَ مَا دُونَ يَوْمِ لبَعْثِ مِنْ عُمُرِى
[which may be rendered O ingenuous woman, (حُرَّ
being an abbreviation of حُرَّةٌ,) I have become an
old man, my sight has become weak, and what is
anterior to the day of resurrection, of my life, has
been passed, or has run out like water poured
forth (فَرِغَ)], says, it is from الفَوْتُ, and الاِفْتِيَاتُ
[app. as the inf. n. of the pass. v. افتيت used in
this verse] signifies الفَرَاغُ. (T.) ―

O,) or to the doing of a thing, (Msb,) without
obeying him who should be obeyed, (S, O,) or following his own opinion only, without consulting
him who had the best right to order in the case:
(Mgh, * Msb:) you say, افتات عَلَيْهِ بِأَمْرِ كَذَا i. e.
بِهِ ↓ فَاتَهُ [app. meaning He so betook himself, &c.,
in opposition to him: or فاته به may be here used
in the sense in which it is expl. above voce تَفَوَّتَ].
(S, O.) And you say, فُلَانٌ لَا يُفْتَاتُ عَلَيْهِ Such a
one, nothing is to be done without his order; (S, O,
K; *) and so عليه ↓ لَا يُفَاتُ; (Har p. 63;) or لَا
يُفْتَاتُ عَلَيْهِ شَىْءٌ دُونَ أَمْرِهِ [which means the same].
(Msb.) أَمِثْلِى يُفْتَاتُ عَلَيْهِ فِى بَنَاتِهِ, (T, M, O,)

Mgh, O, TA,) meaning Shall such a one as I
[am] have anything done in respect of his
daughters without his order? (Mgh, * TA;) and
was said by 'Abd-Er-Rahmán the son of Aboo-Bekr to his sister 'Áïsheh, on the occasion of her
having given in marriage his daughter, the elder
Hafsah, during his absence, to El-Mundhir the
son of Ez-Zubeyr. (T, * O, TA. *) And you say,
افتات عَلَيْهِ فِى شَىْءٍ, and بشَىْءٍ ↓ فَاتَهُ, meaning He
brought to pass a thing exclusively of him [i. e., of
another person, without the latter's having any
part therein]. (TA.) And افتات عَلَيْهِ فى كَذَا,
and عَلَيْهِ فِيهِ ↓ تفوّت, He followed his own opinion
only, exclusively of him [i. e., of another], in the
disposal, or management, of such a thing: the
verbs being trans. by means of عَلَى because
implying the meaning of الثَّغَلُّب. (TA.) And
افتات عَلَيْهِ فِى الأَمْرِ, (M, K, * TA,) and ↓ تفوّت
عَلَيْهِ فِيهِ, (MA,) He decided against him in the
affair. (M, MA, K, * TA.) ―
-b5-  And افتات بِأَمْرِهِ

of him,] جَعَلَ اللّٰهُ رِزْقَهُ فَوْتَ فَمِهِ i. e. [May God
make his sustenance to be beyond the reach of his
mouth,] where he shall see it and shall not attain
it. (S, O. [And the like is said in the M and
A.]) And one says, هُوَ مِنِّى فَوْتَ الرُّمْحِ [He, or
it, is] where my spear will not reach him, or it.

reach of a finger-nail]. (A. [Golius, as on the

explains as syn. with فَوْتَ يَدٍ; but it signifies A
little beyond the reach of a finger-nail.]) ―
