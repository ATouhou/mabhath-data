accord. to analogy, is an inf. n. of unity, and the
latter an inf. n. of modality,] and إِفَآءَةٌ and اِستِفَآءَةٌ
al' signify رُجُوعٌ: (K:) or, accord. to some, فَآءَ
signifies particularly he returned to a good state
or condition. (MF, TA.) One says, فَآءَ مِنْ
غَضَبِهِ He returned [to a good state, or recovered,
from his anger]: (M, TA:) and فُلَانٌ سَرِيعُ الفَىْءِ
مِنْ غَضَبِهِ [Such a one is quick in respect of the
returning &c. from his anger]: (S, M, * O:) and
↓ إِنَّهُ لَسَرِيعُ الفِيْئَةِ, (M,) or ↓ لَحَسَنُ الفِيْئَةِ, (S, O,)
i. e. [Verily he is quick, or good, in respect of]
the returning [to a good state, or from his anger,
or in respect of the manner of returning &c.]: (S,
M, O:) and ↓ هُوَ سَرِيعُ الغَضَبِ سَرِيعُ الفِيْئَةِ [He
is quick in respect of anger, quick in respect of

And فَآءَ إِلَى الأَمْرِ, and فَآءَهُ [i. e. فَآءَ الأَمْرَ], inf. n.
فَىْءٌ and فُيُوْءٌ, He returned [to the affair, or to

(M, TA.) حَتَّى تَفِىْءَ إِلَى أَمْرِ اللّٰهِ , in the Kur

before mentioned] return to the ordinance of God,
or to that which God has commanded: (Bd:) or

-b2-  فَآءَ المُؤْلِى (M, Msb,
K) مِنِ امْرَأَتِهِ, (M, K,) inf. n. فَىْءٌ, (TA,) or
↓ فَيْئَةٌ, (Msb,) means The man who had sworn to
abstain from conjugal intercourse with his wife
expiated his oath and returned to her. (M, Msb, *
K. [See Kur ii. 226.]) But MF observes that
this usage of فَآءَ to signify He expiated an oath
belongs to the conventional language of the law.
(TA.) In the case of a man who has sworn that
he will abstain from conjugal intercourse with his
wife, a period of four months is appointed to him
in the Kur-án; and if he have such intercourse
with her in the four months, it is said of him,
قَدْ فَآءَ, meaning He has returned [or reverted]
from his oath, to the doing that which he swore
that he would not do, and is bound to expiate
his oath: if he have not had such intercourse
with her until the end of the four months from
the day of his swearing, then, Ibn-'Abbás and a
number of the Companions pass upon her a single
sentence of divorce, making the [said sentence of]
divorce to have effect at the end of the months;
but many of the Companions and others say that
in this case he must return, and expiate his oath,
or he must divorce. (T, TA.) And [hence] one
says ↓ لَهُ عَلَى امْرَأَتِهِ فَيْئَةٌ He has the right of
returning to his wife: (Msb, TA:) and هُوَ يَمْلِكُ
↓ فَيْئَتَهَا He possesses the right of returning to her;
namely, a wife whom he has divorced. (A, TA.)

بِالشَّجَرَةِ [He shaded himself by means of the tree;
or] he entered into the أَفْيَآء [or afternoon-shades]
of the tree: (MA:) and [it is said that] تَفَيَّأْتُ
الشَّجَرَةَ signifies I entered into the أَفْيَآء of the tree,
and shaded myself thereby: (Har p. 500:) and
Aboo-Temmám has made it trans. by itself [i. e.
without a prep.] in his saying,
فَتَفَيَّأْتُ ظِلَّهُ مَمْدُودًا
[as though meaning And I protected myself from
the sun by its shade, when it was extended]: but
[perhaps he has thus used the verb in the last of

فَىْءٌ Afternoon-shade; shade after the declining
of the sun from the meridian; (T, * S, O;) [i. e.]
the فَىْء is what was sun, and has been annulled,
or superseded, by shade; (M, K;) or that from
which the sun has departed: so called because of
its “ returning ” from side to side: (S, O: [see 1,
first sentence:]) ISk says, (S, O,) the ظِلّ is
what sun has annulled, or superseded; [correctly,
what sun annuls, or supersedes; (see ظَلٌّ;)] and
the فَىْء is what has annulled, or superseded, sun:
(S, Mgh, O:) but AO says, on the authority of
Ru-beh, that on which the sun has been and from
which it has departed is فَىْء and ظِلّ; and that
on which the sun has not been is ظِلّ: (S, O:)
[see more under this latter word:] pl. [of pauc.]
أَفْيَآءٌ and [of mult,] فُيُوْءٌ. (S, M, Mgh, O, Msb,
K.) ―
-b2-  And Spoil, booty, or plunder; syn. غَنِيمَةٌ
[q. v.]; (S, M, Mgh, O, Msb, K;) thus called,
by the inf. n., because it returns from one party
to another; (Msb;) and فَيٌّ in this sense is not
allowable; (Mgh, Msb;) nor is it in the preceding sense: (Mgh:) or such as is obtained
without difficulty: and therefore likened to shade.
(MF.) And The [tax, or tribute, termed] خَرَاج
[q. v.]: (S, O, K:) frequently occurring in trads.
as meaning such, of the possessions of the unbelievers,
as accrues to the Muslims without war: (TA:) or
such as is obtained from the believers in a plurality
of gods after the laying-down of arms: (A 'Obeyd,
Mgh and Msb voce غَنِيمَةٌ:) or such as God has
restored [as though it were theirs of right] to the
people of his religion, of the possessions of those
who have opposed them, without fighting, either
by the latter's quitting their homes and leaving
them vacant to the Muslims, or by their making
peace on the condition of paying a poll-tax or
other money or property to save themselves from
slaughter: such is termed فَىْء in the Kur-án.

or a company (Msb, TA) of soldiers who fight in
the rear of an army, and to whom the latter has
recourse in the case of fear or defeat: (TA:) or
a company of men who [in war] have recourse,
for aid, one to another: (Er-Rághib, TA:) a
word having no proper sing.: (Msb, TA:) originally فِىْءٌ; (S, O, K;) the ة being substituted
for the medial ى, which is dropped: (S, O:) or
its original form is فِئْوٌ [or فِئْىٌ or فِئْوَةٌ or فِئْيِةٌ (see
art. فأو and فأى)]; the final [radical] letter being
that which is elided; for it is from فَأَوْتُ [or فَأَيْتُ]
“ I divided; ” and فِئَةٌ is syn. with فِرْقَةٌ: (IB, L,
TA:) pl. فِئَاتٌ and فِئُونَ, (S, O, Msb, K,) in
which latter the و and ن are for the making
good what is deficient [in the sing.]. (Msb.)

فِيْئَةٌ: see 1, first quarter, in four places.
تَفِيْئَةٌ, (M and K in art. تفأ,) as also تَفِيَّةٌ, both
mentioned by Lh, and the latter reckoned as a
dial. var. of the former, (M in that art.,) and
تَئِفَّةٌ and إِفُّ and إِفَّةٌ and أَفَّةٌ and إِفَّانٌ and أَفَّانٌ,
(see art. اف,)] The time of a thing: (M and K
in art. تفأ:) one says, أَتَيْتُهُ عَلَى تَفِيئَةِ ذٰلِكَ I came
to him at the time of that: (M in that art.:) and
[by extension of the signification] one says, دَخَلَ
عَلَى تَفِئَةِ فُلَانٍ meaning أَثَرِهِ [i. e. He entered
near after such a one; as though treading in his
footsteps]: (K in the present art.:) the ت in
تَفِيْئَةٌ is an augmentative letter; the word being
[originally] of the measure تَفْعِلَةٌ, but formed by
transposition: Z says that the ت would not be
augmentative if the composition of the word were
as it is here, without transposition: that it is not
of the measure تَفْعِلَةٌ from الفَىْءُ; for, if it were,
it would be of the same measure as تَهْيِئَةٌ [i. e. it
would be تَفْيِئَةٌ]; therefore, if not formed by transposition, it would be of the measure فَعِيلَةٌ [i. e. it
would be from تفأ, as some hold it to be], because
of the إِعْلَال [or alteration for the sake of alleviating the sound, such as takes place in يَسِيرُ for
يَسْيِرُ, which cannot be in a noun of the measure
تَفْعِلَةٌ from a triliteral root like فيأ, whose medial
radical is infirm], the last radical being hemzeh:
but its formation by transposition from تَئِفَّةٌ
[originally تَأْفِفَةٌ] to تَفِّئَةٌ, which is then changed
to تَفِيْئَةٌ, as Z says in the “ Fáïk,” is what determines the ت to be augmentative, and the [original] measure to be تَفْعِلَةٌ. (L and TA * in arts.
تفأ and فيأ.)
مُفَآءٌ A thing that has been made a فَىْء [or
spoil, &c.]. (TA.) And A person whose country,
or province, or town, has been conquered, and
become a فَىْء to the Muslims. (IKt, O, TA.)
It is in a trad. of some of those who have gone
before, ↓ لَا يُؤَمَّرُ مُفَآءٌ عَلَى مُفِىْءٍ, meaning An
emancipated slave shall not be made governor over
an Arabian; (K, TA;) or, as in the Nh [and O]
and L, لا يَلِيَنَّ [shall by no means rule]; (TA;)
as though it were said, none of the people of the
Sawád (which was conquered by force and became
a فَىْء to the Muslims) shall rule over the Companions (O, TA) and their next successors.
(TA.)
مُفِىْءٌ A person who makes a thing [or a country
or the like] to be a فَىْء. (TA.) See also مُفَآءٌ.

مَفْيَأَةٌ: see the paragraph here following.
مَفْيُؤَةٌ A place of فَىْء, i. e. of the shade thus
termed; [a place of afternoon-shade;] (M, K;)
as also ↓ مَفْيَأَةٌ; (K;) and, as AAF says, on the
authority of Th, ↓ مَفِيْئَةٌ; (M, L, TA;) and so
↓ مَفْيُوْءَةٌ, like مَسْمُوعَةٌ [in measure]: (L, TA:)
accord. to Lth, (TA,) مَفْيُؤَةٌ is syn. with مَقْنُؤَةٌ,
(S, TA,) which signifies a place on which the sun
does not come: so says Az; and he adds that it
is probably correct, but that he had not heard it
on any other authority than of Lth. (TA.)
مَفْيُوْءٌ i. q. مَعْتُوهٌ [Idiotic, or an idiot, i. e. deficient, or wanting, in intellect; &c.]: so called
from his keeping long [or much] in the shade.
