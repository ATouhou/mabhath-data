made of palm-leaves, for dates]: (T, * K:) or ripped
the جُلَّة, and then scattered, or dispersed, its contents, (ISk, S, M, O,) entirely, (M,) لِلْقَومِ [for

or smote, him, (ISk, T, S, O,) or his liver, (K,)

one says, فَرَثَ الحُبُّ كَبِدَهُ, and ↓ فَرَّثَهَا, and ↓ افرثها,
meaning (assumed tropical:)  Love crumbled [or crushed] his liver:
[like as we say “ it broke his heart: ”] (M, TA:)

was in it: (ISk, S, O:) or الكَرِشَ عَنِ ↓ فَرَثْتُ

فَرُثَ, inf. n. فَرْثٌ; and أَفْرَثْتُهَا, and ↓ فَرَثْتُهَا;
I ripped the كرش, and scattered what was in it.
(M, TA.) Accord. to the K, one says, افرث الكَبِدَ,
meaning He ripped the كبد [or liver], and threw
away the فُرَاثَة, i. e., what was in it: but this is
taken from two passages in the M and T, which
the author of the K has confounded. (TA.) ―

his companions (T, S, M, O, K) to the ruling

only the inf. n. is mentioned; in a copy of the T
written فَرَث; in the K, فَرْث, and so in a copy of
the A; [accord. to the TK, the pret. is فَرَثَتْ, and

the form of the inf. n. in the K;]) She had a

affected with a heaving of the soul [or stomach],
or a tendency to vomit, and the phlegm at the head
of her stomach is much in quantity: so says ISk,
on the authority of AA: but [Az, after citing
this, adds,] I know not whether it be مُنْفَرِثَةٌ or
↓ مُتَفَرِّثَةٌ: (T, TA: *) and ↓ اِمْرَأَةٌ فَرْثٌ, (M, TA,
[in the former, as given in the TT, the latter
word is written فرْثٌ, without any vowel-sign to
the ف,]) it is said, (TA,) means A woman who
spits, [or expectorates phlegm,] and has a heaving
of the soul [or stomach], or a tendency to vomit,
