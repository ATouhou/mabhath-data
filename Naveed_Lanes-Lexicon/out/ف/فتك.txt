فتك1
فَتَكَ بِهِ, (S, MA, O, Msb, K,) aor.
فَتُكَ and
فَتِكَ,
inf. n. فَتْكٌ and فُتْكٌ and فِتْكٌ (S, O, Msb, K *)
and فُتُوكٌ (MA, K *) and فَتَاكَةٌ, (MA,) He
assassinated him; i. e. he came to him when he
(the latter) was inadvertent, and assaulted him
and slew him; (S, MA, * O;) thus it signifies
accord. to an explanation of الفَتْكُ by A' Obeyd;
and this is the primary signification: (Az, TA:)
if he have not given him [for أَعْطَانَا in my original (an obvious mistranscription) I read أَعْطَاهُ]
assurance of safety, it behooves him to make that
known to him: (A' Obeyd, TA:) he assaulted
him; or he slew him at unawares; and ↓ افتك is
a dial. var. thereof: (Msb:) he seized an opportunity that he (another) offered him (K, TA) by
his inadvertence, (TA,) and slew him: or he
wounded him openly: (K, TA:) or it has a more
general meaning with respect to both of these
acts: (K, * TA:) Fr says that الفَتْكُ signifies the
man's slaying openly. (TA.) It is said in a trad.,
قَيَّدَ الإِيمَانُ الفَتْكَ لَا يَفْتُِكُ مُؤْمِنٌ [i. e. The giving
assurance of safety has inhibited (or, emphatically,
inhibits) the slaying at unawares, &c.: one who
gives assurance of safety shall not slay at unawares,
&c.: the like has been said above: see also an
explanation of the former clause of the trad. in
art. قيد]. (S, O.) ―
