female, S, L, a pregnant female, A, or a woman,

―
-b2-  Also He found him alone, having no second

فَجَدَّلَهُ لَهُمْ فَلَمَّا اسْتَفْرَدَ مِنْهُمْ رَجُلاً كَرَّ عَلَيْهِ [He
fled, or wheeled about widely, from them, to turn

أَفْرَادٌ and ↓ فُرَادَى which latter is anomalous, as
though pl. of فُرْدَانُ (S, L, Msb) and of فَرْدَىْ,
like as سُكَارَى is pl. of سُكْرَانُ and of سَكْرَى. (Msb.

―
-b2-  And Such as has no equal, or like: (Lth, M,
L, K:) pl. أَفْرَادٌ (M, K) and فُرَادَى [respecting
which latter see above]. (K.) الفَرْدُ as an epithet
applied to God means The Single; the Sole; the
One; (T;) He who has no equal, or like; the
Unequalled: (Lth, T, L:) but Az says, I have
not found it so applied in the Sunneh; and no

it is] a word of more common application than

فَرْدَانُ: see فَرْدٌ, second quarter: ―

فَرَادَ; see the paragraph here following.
فُرَادٌ [is most properly regarded as a quasi-pl. n.,
rather than as a pl., of فَرْدٌ; and فُرَادُ is similar to
it in meaning]. One says, جَاؤُوا فُرَاداً, and ↓ فُرَادَى,

فُرَادَ, (K,) like ثُلَاثَ and رُبَاعَ, (TA,) and ↓ فَرَادَ,
and فِرَاداً [a pl. of ↓ فَرْدٌ,] and ↓ فَرْدَى, (K,) [and

said قَوْمٌ فُرَادُ, imperfectly decl., likened to ثُلاَثُ
and رُبَاعُ, [A party composed of separate persons,
disposed by ones, or one after another,] and ↓ فُرَادَى,
which latter is said by Fr to be a pl.: (T, L:) and
the sing. [he adds] is ↓ فَرَدٌ and ↓ فَرِدٌ and ↓ فَرِيدٌ
and ↓ فَرْدَانُ: (T, K:) but ↓ فَرُدٌ, (so accord. to a
copy of the T,) or ↓ فَرْدٌ, (so in the K accord. to
the TA, [in the CK فُرْدٌ,]) in this sense, [i. e. in
the pl. sense] is not allowable. (T, K.)
فَرُودٌ: see فَرْدٌ, second quarter, in two places.
فَرِيدٌ: see فَرْدٌ, former half, in two places: and
see فُرَادٌ. ―
-b2-  Also i. q. شَذْرٌ [app. as meaning The
beads that divide the other beads of a string]; (T,

Persians] called جَاوَرْسَق [a word I do not find in

precious, or highly-esteemed, gem; (M, L, K;) as
also ↓ فَرِيدَةٌ; (K;) as though it were the only
one of its kind; (M, L;) or so called because
unequalled; or because [it is a pearl] found alone
in its shell: (MF:) and as some say, (S,) ↓ فَرَائِدُ
الدُّرِّ signifies the large pearls. (S, L.) ―
-b3-  Also
The intermediate vertebræ between the last of the
six vertebræ that are next to the دَأْى [q. v.] of
the neck and the six that are between these فَرِيد
and the [rump-bone called the] عَجْب; as also
↓ فَرَائِدُ: (M, L, K:) or ↓ فَرِيدَةٌ [the sing.] signifies the vertebra that projects from the part, of
the back of a horse, that is next to the lumbar vertebrœ; intervening between the dorsal vertebræ

middle, in nine places: ―
-b2-  and again, near the
end. ―

white. (K.) ―
-b4-  And إِبِلٌ فَوَارِدُ [She-camels]
which stallions do not resemble (لاَ تُشْبِهُهَا). (So in
the O and K. [But the right reading is evidently
I think, لا تَشْتَهِيهَا, which the Turkish translator
of the K appears to have found in a copy of that
work; and the meaning, therefore, which stallions
do not desire. فَوَارِدُ is pl. of فَارِدَةٌ.])
مُفْرَدٌ: see فَرْدٌ, second quarter. ―
-b2-  [Hence, as a
conventional term, A single, simple, word or
vocable;] an expression of which a portion does
not denote a portion of its meaning: (KT:) [pl.
مُفْرَدَاتٌ. ―
-b3-  And Singular, as distinguished from

means Good betide those who apply themselves to
the study of practical religion, or the law, and
withdraw from [the rest of] mankind, and attend
only to the observance of the commands and prohibitions [of religion]: (IAar, T, * L, K, TA:)
and (K, TA) it is also said to mean (TA) those
who are devoted to the commemoration of the
praises of God: (K, TA:) or, as expl. by the
Prophet himself, those men and women who commemorate the praises of God much, or frequently:
(TA:) also, (K,) or, as Kt says in explaining the
trad., (TA,) [and as his words are cited in the
T,] those whose contemporaries in birth, (K, TA,)
and the generation among which they were, (TA,)
have perished, or died, while they themselves have
remained, (K, TA,) commemorating the praises
of God: but Az holds the explanation of IAar
to be more correct than this of Kt. (TA.)
مِفْرَادٌ: see فَرْدٌ, near the middle of the paragraph.
المَفَارِيدٌ as a conventional term in lexicology
signifies What have been uttered by only one of
