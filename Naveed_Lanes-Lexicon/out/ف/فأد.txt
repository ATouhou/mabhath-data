-A2-  See also 1,

فَأْدٌ: [see 1, of which it is the inf. n.: and] see
the paragraph here following.
فُؤَادٌ (S, M, A, Msb, K, &c.) and فَوَادٌ, which
is strange, (K,) but said by Esh-Shiháb to be a
dial var., and to be without reason disallowed by
AHát; (TA;) of the masc. gender only; (Lh,
M, L, K, &c.;) The heart; syn. قَلْبٌ [q. v.];
(S, M, A, L, Msb, K, &c.;) of man, and of
an animal other than man: (M, L:) so called
because of its تَفَأُّد (T, M, L, K) i. e. تَوَقُّد [or
ardour]; (M, L, K;) or because of its pulsation,
and commotion; [for which reason also the heart
is said to be called القَلْبُ, from التَّقَلُّبُ;] for it
is said that the primary meaning of ↓ فَأْدٌ is
“ motion,” and the “ putting in motion: ” (MF,
TA:) or the heart is thus called only when its
تَفَأُّد, i. e. its تَوَقُّد, is regarded: and most authors
make a distinction between فُؤَاد and قَلْبٌ; the
latter of which is said to have a more special
signification than the former: (TA:) and the
former is said to be [the pericardium,] the غِشَآء,
(L, TA,) or the وِعَآء, (TA,) of the قَلْب: (L,
TA:) or the middle thereof: (L:) or the interior thereof: (TA:) the قَلْب being its حَبَّة
[q. v.], (L, TA,) or its سُوَيْدَآء: (L:) or فُؤَادٌ
signifies the appendages of the مَرِىْء [or œsophagus], consisting of the liver and lungs and
قَلْب [or heart]: (K:) pl. أَفْئِدَةٌ, (S, M, A, Mgh,
Msb, K, &c.,) the only pl. thereof known to Sb.
(M, L.) ―
-b2-  Also The mind, or intellect: and this,
it is said, may be the meaning of the phrase [in
the Kur liii. 11], مَا كَذَبَ الْفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَى, (TA,) or
ما كَذَّبَ, another reading, i. e. [The mind] did not
disacknowledge, or deem improbable, what he saw.
(Jel.) [Hence,] حِدَّةُ الفُؤَادِ i. q. ذَكَآءٌ [meaning
Sharpness, or acuteness, of mind, in a man: and
sharpness of spirit in a beast]. (S in art. ذكو.)
[And حَدِيدُ الفُؤَادِ i. q. ذَكِئٌّ meaning Sharp, or
acute, in mind, applied to a man: and sharp in
spirit, applied to a beast:] one says فَرَسٌ حَدِيدَةُ
الفُؤَادِ [A mare sharp in spirit]; and in like
manner نَاقَةٌ [a she-camel]: (S and K in art.
روع:) and نَاقَةٌ رُوَاعَةُ الفُؤَادِ, and رُوَاعُ الفُؤَادِ, a
quick, spirited, vigorous, she-camel; sharp in
spirit; syn. شَهْمَةٌ ذَكِيَّةٌ. (K in that art.) [And
طَارَ فُؤَادُهُ His mind or intellect, fled: and his
courage. (See شَعَاعٌ: and طَارَ.)]

L,) Roasted, (T, S, M, L, K,) as also ↓ مَفْؤُودٌ,
(M, L, K,) on the fire: (T:) or roasted upon live
coals; as also ↓ مُفْأَدٌ [evidently, I think, a mistranscription for ↓ مُفْتَأَدٌ]. (L.) ―
-b2-  And فَئِيدٌ signifies also Fire or a fire [for baking &c.].
(T, L, K.)
أُفْؤُودٌ A place which one makes, for a cake of
