―
-b2-  And i. q. كَسَرَهُ [app. as meaning He broke
it, in an unrestricted sense; as well as in another
sense; as will be shown by what follows]. (S.)
وَلَا فَلُّوا لَهُ صَقاةً, i. e. [lit.] Nor did they break a
stone (كَسَرُوا حَجَرَا) belonging to him, was said
by 'Áïsheh in describing her father: she alluded
thereby to his strength in religion. (TA. [See
also قَرَعَ صَفَاتَهُ, in art. صفو; and see also مَغْمَزٌ.])
And [in like manner] one says, غَرْبَهُ ↓ استفلّ

a prov., (Meyd, O,) meaning He who has few
aiders is overcome, [or becomes abased], and he
who has many relations [or who possesses authority
to command] defeats (فَلَّ) his enemies. (Meyd.
[In Freytag's Arab. Prov., ii. 683, a different
(and I think a wrong) reading is given, with قَلَّ
in the place of فَلَّ; though the reading with فَلَّ
is added.]) شَجَّكِ أَوْ فَلَّكِ أَوْ جَمَعَ كُلًّا لَكِ, in the
story of Umm-Zara, is said to mean, Whether he
wound thee by smiting thy head, or break a limb
[of thee], or combine the two deeds to thee: or by
فلّك is meant altercate, or wrangle, with thee:
(TA, in two places:) or the meaning [of فلّك] is
defeat thee [so I render كَسَرَكِ]; or take away thy
property; or defeat thee (كَسَرَكِ) with his altercation and his censure. (O.)
-A2-  فَلَّ عَنْهُ عَقْلُهُ,
aor.
فَلَ3َ, [in the CK (erroneously)
فَلُ3َ,] His intellect,
or intelligence, departed from him, and then returned. (M, K.)

فَلَّ3َ see above, first sentence. ―
-b2-  تَفْلِيلٌ [as inf. n.
of the pass. v. فُلِّلَ] means The state of being
broken, or notched, [much, or in many places,] in
the edge of a knife, or in the edges of the teeth,
(T, TA,) and the like, (T,) [i. e.] and also in [the
edge of] a sword. (TA.)

افلّت الأَرْضُ The land became such as is
termed فِلّ [q. v.]. (AHn, M.) ―
-b2-  And أَفَلّ,
(Fr, T,) and أَفْلَلْنَا, (S, O,) He (a man, Fr, T,)
and we, (S, O,) became in a land such as is
termed فِلّ, (Fr, T, S, O,) upon which rain had
not fallen: (Fr, T:) or the latter means we trod
a land (M, K) such as is termed فِلّ (M) or such
as is termed فَلّ. (K.) ―
-b3-  And افلّ (assumed tropical:)  He (a man,
S, M, O) lost, or became deprived of, his property: (S, M, O, K:) from فِلٌّ applied to land.
(M.) ―

تَفَلَّ3َ see the next paragraph, in three places:
-A2-  and see also R. Q. 1, in two places [in each
of which the verb is most probably, I think,
mistranscribed].

انفلّ It became broken, or notched, in its
edge; as also ↓ افتلّ, and ↓ تفلّل; (M, K, TA;)
said of [a sword or the like, or of] anything;
(M;) the first quasi-pass. of فَلَّهُ, as is also the
second; but the third is quasi-pass of فلَّلَهُ [and
implying that it was so much, or in many places,
or said of several things or of several parts of a
thing]; (TA;) [therefore] one says [of a sword],
مَضَارِبُهُ ↓ تَفَلَّلَتْ, meaning تَكَسَّرَتْ [i. e. Its edges
(for the swords of the Arabs in the older times
were generally two-edged), or its parts for striking, became broken, or notched, much, or in many
places]; (S, TA;) and one says, انفلّ سِنُّهُ, (T,
TA,) meaning [simply] His tooth became broken,
or notched, in its edge. (TA.) And انفلّوا They
became defeated; (S, * M, Msb, K;) as also
↓ تفلّلوا [but this has an intensive signification].

of the thing the least portion, (M, K,) because of
its difficulty (لِعُسْرِهِ), (M,) or such as the tenth

the obtaining a little thing from a difficult place;
from a place of the seeking of a right, or due, or
of a gift; it having no other object than a thing
of little account. (T.)
R. Q. 1
فَلْفَلَ He walked with an elegant and
a proud and self-conceited gait, with an affected
inclining of the body from side to side; (T, O,
TA;) as also ↓ تَفَلْفَلَ: (TA:) or both signify he
walked thus, with short steps: (K:) or ↓ تفلفل
signifies [simply] he went with short steps; (En-Nadr, O;) or so ↓ تفلّل. (T accord. to the TT.)
-A2-  And He rubbed and cleaned his teeth with the
[stick called] سِوَاك; (T, O, K;) as also ↓ تفلفل;

TT.)

the food and the wine or beverage. (M.)
-A4-
[And فلفل الشَّعَرَ He made the hair very crisp, or
such as we term woolly, like that of the negro:
see the pass. part. n., below.]
R. Q. 2
تَفَلْفَلَ: see R. Q. 1, in three places.
-A2-  Said of the hair of a negro, It became very
crisp [or such as we term woolly]. (M, TA.) ―
-b2-
And تفلفل قَادِمَتَا الضَّرْعِ The two anterior teats of
the udder became black. (S, O, K.)
يَا فُلُ, (S in this art. and in art. فلن, and K
and TA in the latter art.,) meaning يَا فُلَانُ [O
such a one], (S &c.,) with refa and without tenween, (TA,) is sometimes said to one person,
[i. e. to a man,] and يَا فُلَانِ to two persons, and
يَا فُلُونَ to a pl. number; and يَا فُلَةُ to a female,
and يَا فُلَتَانِ to two females, and يَا فُلَاتُ to a pl.
number of females, (K, TA,) and sometimes يَا
فُلَاةُ, (K, * TA,) thus correctly, of the dial. of
some of the tribe of Temeem, in the copies of
the K erroneously written يا فُلَاتُ, (TA,) is said,
and some say يَا فُلَ, [in the CK يافلُ, but correctly يافُلَ, i. e., as is said in the TA, بِنَصْبِ
اللَّامِ,] meaning يَا فُلَةُ: (K, TA:) [J says,] يَا
فُلُ, without teshdeed, said in calling to a person,
is apocopated from يَا فُلَانُ; not formed in the
way of تَرْخِيم, for if it were an instance of ترخيم
they would say يَا فُلَا: (S in this art.:) [or,]
accord. to Sb, يَا فُلُ is not held to be an instance
of a word from which is elided something that
is retained when it is not [thus] used in calling to
a person, but the noun in this case is made to be
of two letters in the manner of دَمٌ [which is originally دَمَوٌ or دَمًى or دَمْىٌ], and it is thus made
to be of two letters because a word that is used
in calling to a person or thing is a subject for
elision: (M in this art.:) and sometimes فُل was
used otherwise than in calling to a person, by
poetic license, as in the saying of Abu-n-Nejm,
فِى لَجَّةٍ أَمْسِكْ فُلَانًا عَنْ فُلِ
(S and M in this art.,) meaning عن فُلَانٍ [i. e.
In, or amid, a multitude of cries, or noises:
(thus expl. in the S:) withhold thou such a one
from such a one]: (S in art. فلن:) and Sb disallowed the saying فُلُ as meaning فُلَان [in the
CK (erroneously) يا فُلُ as meaning يا فُلَانُ] except [in the vocative form of speech and] in
poetry: (M and K and TA in art. فلن:) [but]
they said [also] فُلُ بْنُ فُلِ, [said to be] an instance
of an elision, (T and M in art. فلن,) i. e. of the
elision of a final و [accord. to some, who hold
فُلَانٌ to be originally فُلْوَانٌ]; (T;) like as they
said هَىُّ بْنُ بَىٍّ: (T, M:) and أَىْ فُلْ, with the
ل quiescent, occurs in a trad. respecting the resurrection; meaning يَا فُلَانُ: (TA:) Ibn-Buzurj
says that some of the tribe of اسد [i. e. Asd or
Asad] say يا فل [app. يَافُلُ, without any variation,] in calling to a man and to two men and to
a pl. number of men and to a female: (TA in art.
فلن:) accord. to As, one says يَا فُلُ and يَا فُلَاهْ;
he who says يَا فُلُ saying thus [when he pauses
after it and] when he goes on, making the noun
marfooa without tenween; whereas he who says
يَافُلَاهْ says thus when he is silent after it, retaining the ه [which is termed the ه of pausation].
but when he goes on he rejects the ه and makes
the noun to be mansoob, saying [for ex.] يَا فُلَا قُلْ
[O such a one, say]. (T and TA in art. فلن.)
[See also مُضَمَّنٌ (in art. ضمن), last sentence.]
فَلٌّ A break, or notch, in the edge, (ISk, T, S,
M, O, Msb, K,) of a sword, (ISk, T, S, O, Msb,
K,) [or the like,] or of anything; (M;) and so
↓ فَلَّةٌ [i. e. a single break, or notch, in the edge,] of
a sword: (TA:) pl. of the former فُلُولٌ, (ISk,
T, S, M, O, Msb, K,) of which an ex. occurs in
a verse cited voce بَيْدَ: (O, TA:) it has been
said that فُلُولٌ is an inf. n.; but it is more correctly said to be pl. of فَلٌّ. (M.) ―
-b2-  And A
portion that has fallen off from a thing, like the
filings of gold and of silver, and the sparks of
fire: (M, K, TA:) pl. فُلُولٌ. (M, TA.)
-A2-  And
A company (M, K, TA) of men; (TA;) as also
↓ فَلِيلٌ: (M, K, TA:) pl. of the former فُلُولٌ.
(TA.)
-A3-  And it is [an epithet] applied to a
number of men, (S, M, O, K, [in the CK in this
case, erroneously, فُلٌّ,]) and to a single man, (S,
O,) signifying Defeated; (S, M, O, K;) and
↓ فُلَّى also signifies thus, applied to a كَتِيبَة [i. e.
a military force, or troop, &c.]; (AA, T, O, K;)
like فُرَّى: (AA, T, O:) one says رَجُلٌ فَلٌّ and
قَوْمٌ فَلٌّ, and sometimes [when speaking of a
number of men] they said فُلُولٌ and فِلَالٌ; (S,
O;) accord. to the copies of the K, the pl. is
فُلُولٌ and أَفْلَالٌ; but correctly the latter is فُلَّالٌ,
like رُمَّانٌ, as in the M; (TA;) [i. e.] the pl. is
فُلُولٌ and فُلَّالٌ: and [of فَلٌّ used in a pl. sense
it is said that] it must be either a quasi-pl. n. or
[originally] an inf. n.: if the former, the sing.
should by rule be فَالٌّ, the case being like شَارِبٌ
and شَرْبٌ, [of which the former is a sing, and the
latter is a quasi-pl. n.,] and فَالٌّ is of the measure
فَاعِلٌ in the sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ: and
فلول is not necessarily pl. of فَلٌّ, but is rather pl.
of فَالٌّ; for the pl. of the quasi-pl. n. is extr.,
like the pl. of the pl.: (M, TA: *) and as to فَلَّالٌ,
it is necessarily pl. of فَالٌّ, for فَعْلٌ is not of the
forms that have فُعَّالٌ as the measure of a pl.:
(M, TA:) if it [i. e. فَلٌّ] be [originally] an inf. n.,
[this accounts for its being applied alike to a
number of men and to a single man, which is not
mentioned in the M, or] it is like نَسْجٌ in the sense
of مَنْسُوجٌ in the phrase نَسْجُ اليَمَنِ. (M.)
-A4-  Also
Land affected with drought or barrenness; as also
↓ فِلٌّ: or [i. e. the former accord. to the K, but
app. each accord. to the text of the M as given
in the TT,] such as is rained upon but does not
produce plants or herbage: (AO, M, K:) or such
as the rain has failed to fall upon during several
years: or such as is not rained upon between two
lands that have been rained upon: (M, K:) or,
accord. to AO, this is termed خَطِيطَةٌ; فلّ having
the second of the meanings expl. in this sentence:
(M:) or upon which rain has not fallen: (TA:)
[in this sense, in the TT, as from the T, written
فِل [for ↓ فِلّ]: and so in the same, as from the T
and M, in the sense here following:] or in which
is nothing; (T, M, * K; *) so says IAar; whence,
he adds, الفَلَاةُ; but [Az says] I do not think
that it is taken thence: (T:) the pl. is like the
sing., [or rather the word used as a sing. is likewise used as a pl.,] and أَفْلَالٌ, (M, K,) this pl.
form being sometimes used: (M:) or the pl. of
↓ الفِلُّ is أَفْلَالٌ; and one says also أَرْضٌ أَفْلَالٌ.
(T.)
-A5-  And A sort of cloth made of the hard
fibres of flax. (TA.)
فَلٌّ a term for يَاسَمِين مُضَاعَذ [Double jasmine],
which is [rendered so] either بِالتَّرْكِيب [an expression meaning, as used in the present day, by
grafting], or by slitting the stem thereof and inserting into it the [additional] jasmine [app.
meaning by budding]: it is a flower of pure
whiteness; and the rubbing oneself with its leaves
perfumes the body: (TA:) [this name, or, more
commonly, ↓ فِلّ, is now applied to the Arabian
jasmine (jasminum sambac), or, as Forskål says
(Flora Aegypt. Arab. p. cii.), nyctanthes sambac,
mentioned by him among the plants cultivated in
El-Yemen.] ―
-b2-  [Freytag, misled by the CK, has
assigned to this word a meaning belonging to
فَلٌّ.]
فِلٌّ Land in which is no herbage; (K;) or land
not rained upon, and in which is no herbage. (S,
O.) See also فَلٌّ, in three places. ―
-b2-  غَدَا فِلًّا مِنَ
الطَّعَامِ, with kesr, means [He went forth early in
the morning] devoid of food. (O.) ―
-b3-  And فِلٌّ
مِنَ الخَيْرِ occurs in a verse, (S, O,) in the poetry
of 'Abd-Allah Ibn-Rawáhah and in that of
Hassán, (S, O,) meaning Devoid of good. (S,
TA.) [See عَلٌّ.]
-A2-  And Such as has become
thin, of hair. (K.)
-A3-  See also فُلٌّ.
فَلَّةٌ: see فَلٌّ, first sentence.
فَلَلٌ, in a sword [or the like], The state of
having breaks, or notches, in the edge. (S, O.)
فَلِيلٌ: see أَفَلُّ. ―
-b2-  Applied to the tusk, or
canine tooth, of a camel, Broken (S, M, O, K)
in the edge. (S, O.)
-A2-  See also فَلٌّ, first quarter.
-A3-  Also, and ↓ فَلِيلَةٌ, a quantity of hair collected
together: (S, M, O, K:) the two words are either
of the class of سَلٌّ and سَلَّةٌ [which are exactly
syn., each with the other,] or are an instance of
the pl. [or rather coll. gen. n.] that does not differ
from its sing. [or n. un.] except in [its not having]
the [affix] ة: (M:) in one instance, occurring in
a trad., the latter is said to signify a كُبَّة [or portion convolved, or glomerated, or formed into a
ball] of hair, or, as Z says, app. of [the silk
called] دِمَقْس: the pl. [of either] is فَلَائِلُ. (TA.)
Hence, (O,) ↓ فَلِيلَةٌ signifies also The mane of
the lion. (O, TA.) In the saying of Sá'ideh
Ibn-Ju-eiyeh,
وَغُودِرَ ثَاوِيًا وَتَأَوَّبَتْهُ
مُذَرَّعَةٌ أُمَيْمَ لَهَا فَلِيلُ
[And he was left remaining, and a hyena having
stripes upon its arms, (thus مُذَرَّعَةٌ as used in this
verse is expl. in the TA in art. ذدع, q. v.,) a
young mother, (أُمَيْمَ being an instance of تَرْخِيم,
used by poetic license, for أُمَيْمَةُ, a dim. of أُمٌّ,)
and therefore unusually fierce, having a mane, or
having convolved, or glomerated, hair, came to
him at night, or in the beginning of the night],
the last word is expl. by Suh, in the R, as meaning the عَرْف [so in my original, an obvious mistranscription for عُرْف, with damm]; but by Skr
as meaning شَعَر مَكْبُوب. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And فَلِيلٌ
signifies also [The membranous fibres that grow
at the base of the branches of the palm-tree, called]
لِيف: (M, K:) so in the dial. of Hudheyl: (TA:)
and ↓ فُلِفُلٌ signifies the same. (K.)
فَلِيلَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in two
places.
فُلَّى: see فَلُّفِلّيَّةٌ, in the former half.
فِلِّيَّةٌ, (T, * K, TA,) like عِلِّيَّةٌ, (TA,) or فَلِّيَّةٌ,
(O, *) [in the TT, as from the T, and in the O.
written without the sign of teshdeed to the ل (app.
because it is sufficiently indicated by the heading
of the art. and by the pl. of this word), and in
the CK, erroneously, فِلْيَة,] Land upon which the
rain [that should have been that] of its year has
not fallen until the falling of the rain of the next
year upon it: pl. فَلَالِىُّ: (ISh, T, O, K:) [and
Az says,] I have heard them call thus (i. e. by
the sing.) land in which is nothing; like فِلٌّ as
expl. by IAar. (T.)
فُلْفُلٌ, (S, M, O, Msb, K,) also pronounced
↓ فِلْفِلٌ, (K,) but the vulgar pronounce it [thus]
with kesr, (O,) and the pronouncing it with kesr
is said to be not allowable, (Msb,) a word of
Pers. origin, (M,) arabicized, from پِلْپِل, with
kesr, (O,) [or پُلْپُل; i. e. Pepper;] a sort of
berry, (حَبٌّ, S, O, K,) brought from India, (O,
K, *) well known, (S, M, O,) not growing in the
land of the Arabs, but often mentioned in their
language: AHn was informed by one who had
seen it that its tree is just like the pomegranate;
(M, TA;) but Dáwood the hakeem adds that it
is taller; (TA;) between the pair of leaves thereof
are two fruit-stalks, regularly disposed, each fruitstalk of the length of the finger; and it is green,
and is then plucked, and spread in the shade, and
becomes black and shrivelled; and it [the tree]
has thorns, like those of the pomegranate: when
it [i. e. the fruit] is fresh and moist, it is preserved
with water and salt until it becomes mature, when
it is eaten like as preserved herbs are eaten upon
the tables of food, and it is a digestive: the n. un.
is ↓ فُلْفُلَةٌ [app. meaning a peppercorn, like حَبَّةُ
فُلْفُلٍ: and حَبُّ فُلْفُلٍ means peppercorns, collectively]: (M, TA:) Dáwood says, in the “ Tedhkireh,” that its leaves are thin, red next the tree
and green in the other direction, and its wood is
lank and soft: and it is white and black: (TA:)
the white is the better. (TA.) [A long description of its properties, with additions in the TA,
some of them well known and others fanciful, I
omit as being needless.] ―
-b2-  دَارُفُلْفُل, or ↓ دَارُفِلْفِل,
(accord. to different copies of the K,) [app.
دَارُفُلْفُلٌ, or perhaps دَارَفُلْفُلٌ, a compound of two
words (both originally Pers.) made one, as such
written in the K with the article (الدّارفلفل), and
perfectly declinable, because (although a compound of two nouns) it is not a proper name,] is
The tree of the فُلْفُل when it first bears fruit,
accord. to the K; but several writers declare that
the tree of [the] دار فلفل is not the same as the
tree of the فلفل: (MF, TA:) [دار فلفل is one of
the names now applied to long pepper, and is
commonly pronounced دَارْفِلْفِلْ:] it is [generally]
known in Egypt by the name of عِرْقُ الذَّهَبِ,
[another term, now used, for long pepper,] and
is called in Pers. پلپل دراز [i. e. پُلْپِلدَرَاز, the
latter of which words signifies “ long ”]: (TA:)
it increases the venereal faculty, causes the food
to digest; removes colic, (K, TA,) and flatulence;
(TA;) and is beneficial as a remedy against the
bite, or sting, of venomous reptiles, applied as a
liniment, with oil. (K, TA.) ―
-b3-  فُلْفُلٌ is also a
name sometimes applied to The fruit of the بَرْوَق
[q. v., in art. برق]; likening it to the فُلْفُلٌ mentioned before [i. e. to peppercorns]: he who pronounces it, when thus applied, ↓ فِلْفِلٌ errs; for
this signifies the fruit of certain trees of the [kind
called] عِضَاه; and the people of El-Yemen call
thus [particularly] the fruit of the [species of عِضَاه.
termed] غَاف [q. v.]. (M.) ―
-b4-  فُلْفُلُ المَآءِ is the
name of A certain plant growing in the neighbourhood of water, lank, soft, or smooth, in the
leaves, having berries (حَبِّ) in bunches. (TA.)

-b5-  فُلْفُلُ القُرُودِ is The same as حبّ الليم [but
what this is I do not find]. (TA.) ―
-b6-  فُلْفُلُ

فَنْجَنْكُشْت: see الفَقْدُ]. (TA.) ―
-b7-  [فَلَافِلُ is pl.
of فُلْفُلٌ.] And فَلَافِلُ السُّودَانِ is the name of
Certain berries (حَبّ), round and smooth, in

like the صَنَوْبَر [or cone of the pine, app. in form].
(TA.)
-A2-  See also فَلِيلٌ, last sentence.
-A3-  فُلْفُلٌ
signifies also A sharp, or clever, servant; (T, O,
K;) and ↓ فِلْفِلٌ is said to signify thus likewise
by Mullà 'Alee, in his “ Námoos,” and even more
commonly: but this requires consideration. (MF,
