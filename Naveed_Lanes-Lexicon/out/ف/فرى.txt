فرى1
فَرَاهُ, (M, K,) aor. يَفْرِيهِ, (K,) inf. n. فَرْىٌ,
(K,) He slit it, or cut it lengthwise, ill, or improperly; or well, or properly; as also ↓ فرّاهُ and
↓ افراهُ [both relating to both of the foregoing
explanations]: (K:) or he slit it, or cut it lengthwise, and made it bad, or improper; as also ↓ فرّاهُ:
or, accord. to the sound lexicologists, the former
has this meaning: but ↓ افرى signifies he slit, or
cut lengthwise, and made good, or proper: (M:)
or ↓ افراهُ (M, K) signifies, (M,) or signifies also,
(K,) he made it good, or proper: or he ordered
[another] to make it so: (M, K:) as though he
removed from it unsoundness, or imperfection:
but some say that this signifies he slit it, or cut it
lengthwise, and made it bad, or improper: and
when you mean he measured it, and cut it, to
make it good, or proper, you say فَرَاهُ, inf. n. فَرْىٌ:
(M:) [thus, accord. to J,] فَرَى, aor. and inf. n.
as above, signifies he cut a thing in order to make
it good, or proper: (S:) or he cut a skin, or hide,
in a good, or proper, manner: (Ks, S, Msb:)
and ↓ افرى he cut it in a bad, or an improper,
manner: (Ks, S:) or this signifies he slit much,
in a bad, or an improper, manner: and افرى
الجِلْدَ, accord. to As, he rent, tore, or slit, the
skin, and made holes in it, and spoiled it: and
افرى signifies also he slit a thing (S, M, Msb) of
any kind; (as also ↓ فرّاهُ:]) thus you say,
افرى الأَودَاجَ he slit the اوداج [or external jugular
veins], (T, M, Mgh, Msb,) and made what was
in them, of the blood, to come forth; (T, Mgh,
Msb;) and in like manner one says of a garment,
or piece of cloth, and of a جُلَّة [or receptacle for
dates, made of palm-leaves woven together]; (T;)
or he cut the اوداج: (S:) IAar alone mentions
فَرَى أَوْدَاجَهُ and ↓ افراها: (M:) [but it is also said
that فَرَى signifies he cut a نِطَع [or the like]: (K
in art. خلق: [see an ex. in a verse cited in the
first paragraph of that art.; also cited in the T
after the first of the explanations here following,
and in the M after the second thereof:]) or فَرَى,
aor. and inf. n. as above, signifies he measured,
and worked, or manufactured, and made good, or
proper, a thing, such as a sandal, or a نِطَع [q. v.],
or a water-skin, and the like: (T:) or he
measured it, and cut it, to make it good, or
proper: (M:) and he measured and manufactured a مَزَادَة [or leathern water-bag]: (S, K:)
or he sewed, and made well, or properly, a مزادة:
(T:) [it is said that] the difference between ↓ الإِفْرَاءُ
an الفَرْىُ is this, that the former signifies the
cutting so as to render bad, or improper, and the
slitting like as the slaughterer and the wild beast
slit [their victims]; and the latter, the cutting so
as to make good, or proper, like the act of cutting
of the sewer of the hide, or of leather: but فَرَى
sometimes occurs in the sense of افرى: (Mgh:)
one says, رَأْسَهُ ↓ أَفْرَيْتُ, meaning I split, or clave,
his head with a sword; like أَفْرَرْتُهُ: (Yz, T &c.
in art. فر:) and افرى الجُرْحَ he slit the wound:
(T:) and افرى الذِّئْبُ بَطْنَ الشَّاةِ [the wolf slit, or
rent, the belly of the sheep, or goat]: (S:) and
one says, قَدْ أَفْرَيْتَ وَمَا فَرَيْتَ i. e. thou hast done
ill, or improperly, and hast not done well, or properly. (A, TA.) ―
-b2-  فَرَاهُ, aor. as above, [and so
the inf. n.,] is sometimes metonymically used [as
meaning (tropical:)  He slaughtered him, or butchered him;
i. e.] as denoting vehemence, or excess, in slaying.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  And it means also (assumed tropical:)  He cut him with
censure, or satire: (TA:) and ↓ افرى means he
blamed, or censured, a man. (M, K.) ―
-b4-  And
you say, فَرَيْتُ الأَرْضَ (tropical:)  I traversed, or crossed,
(lit. travelled and cut,) the land, or country; (T,
S, K, TA;) inf. n. as above. (TA.) ―
-b5-  هُوَ يَفْرِى
↓ الفَرِىَّ means (assumed tropical:)  He effects what is wonderful in
his deed. (S, K.) أَحَدٌ ↓ مَا يَفْرِى فَرِيَّهُ, thus, with
teshdeed [to the ى in فريه] as related by A'Obeyd,
is said of a courageous man [as meaning No one
does his deed, or the like]: but it is said [by Kh]
to be correctly فَرْيَهُ, [as an inf. n.,] without tesh-deed. (M. [See, however, what follows.]) They
say, ↓ تَرَكْتُهُ يَفْرِى الفَرِىَّ, meaning [I left him]
doing well, or excellently, in a deed, or in watering:
[an explanation relating to what here follows:]
the Prophet said, respecting 'Omar, whom he saw
in a dream drawing water at a well with a great
bucket, ↓ فَلَمْ أَرَ عَبْقَرِيًّا يَفْرِى فَرِيَّهُ [And I have
not seen a chief of a people do his deed, &c.]:
(T:) or, as some relate it, he said فَرْيَهُ: (TA:)
[but] A'Obeyd says, this is like thy saying يَعْمَلُ
عَمَلَهُ and يَقُولُ قَوْلَهُ; and Fr cited to us [as
an ex.]
↓ قَدْ كُنْتِ تَفْرِينَ بِهِ الفَرِيَّا
meaning [Verily] thou didst multiply and magnify
thy words respecting it: (T: and in like manner
this hemistich [which shows, by the measure, that
الفَرِيَّا cannot be here a mistake for الفَرْيَا,] is expl.
in the S:) it is said that ↓ فَرِىّ thus used is of the
measure فَعيلٌ in the sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ,
from فَرَى signifying “ he cut ” [or “ cut lengthwise ” or “ slit ”] a hide, or leather; (Har p. 257;
[where see more;]) [and this assertion is corroborated by the fact that] one says of a man
strenuous, or vigorous, in an affair, and strong,
وَيَقُدُّ ↓ تَرَكْتُهُ يَفْرِى الفَرِىَّ [lit. I left him slitting,
or cutting, the slit, or cut, thing, and shaping].
(T.) ―

-b7-  فَرَى البَرْقُ, aor.

K,) aor. يَفْرَى, (T, S,) inf. n. فَرًى, (T, S, K, but
omitted in the CK,) He was, or became, confounded, or perplexed, and unable to see his right
course; syn. بَهِتَ, (T,) and دَهِشَ, (T, S, M, K,)
and تَحَيَّرَ, (S, K,) and بَطِرَ: (Skr, on the verse
here following:) El-Aalam El-Hudhalee says,
وَفَرِيتُ مِنْ فَزَعٍ فَلَا
أَرْمِى وَلَا وَدَّعْتُ صَاحِبْ
[And I became confounded, &c., by reason of
fright, so that I did not shoot an arrow, nor
bade I farewell to a friend]: (T, M:) or, accord.
to As, فَرِىَ, aor. يَفْرَى, signifies he looked, and
knew not what he should do: (T:) and فَرِيتُ signifies also I wondered; from ↓ الفَرِىُّ meaning
“ that which is wonderful. ” (Skr, on the verse
above-cited.)

تفرّى It became slit, or cut lengthwise; (S,
M, Msb, K;) as also ↓ انفرى; (S, M, Msb;)
both said of a skin, (M,) or of a thing: (S:) or
it became much slit, or rent; said of the sewing
of a leathern water-skin. (T.) And تفرّى عَنْهُ
ثَوْبُهُ His garment became much slit, or rent, from

بَنِى الأَجْلَادِ مِنْهَا وَالرِّمَالِ
i. e. (assumed tropical:)  Its eggs (the pronoun in بيضها denoting the
earth) burst from us [so as to disclose us], so that
we were the sons of the hard tracts thereof and of
the soft tracts, or plains, [or of the sands,] means
only their numerousness, and the wide extent of
their districts. (Ham p. 341.) ―

إِفْتَرَىَ افترىكَذِبًا He forged, or fabricated, a lie,
or falsehood; (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K;) you
say, افترى عَلَيْهِ كَذِبًا [he forged against him a
lie]; (Mgh, Msb;) and كَذِبًا ↓ فَرَى signifies the
same, (T, S, M, Msb, K,) aor. يَفْرِى, (Msb,)
inf. n. فَرْىٌ; (M;) and this verb likewise is
followed by عَلَيْهِ: (Msb:) ↓ فَرَى in this sense is
mentioned as said by Lth; others saying افترى.
(T.) افترى is used in the Kur in relation also to
the attributing a copartner to God: thus in the
saying [in iv. 51], وَمَنْ يُشْرِكْ بِاللّٰهِ فَقَدِ افْتَرِىإِثمًا
عَظِيمًا [And whoso attributeth a copartner to God,
hath devised an enormous sin]. (Er-Rághib, TA.)

cries or shouts or noises. (M, K, TA. [الحَلْبَةُ in
the CK is a mistake for الجَلَبَةُ.])
فِرْيَةٌ A lie, or falsehood; (S, * M, Mgh, * Msb, *
K, TA;) a subst. from اِفْتَرَى: (S, Mgh, Msb,
TA:) and meaning [also] a defamation: (Mgh:)

-b2-  And An affair, or a case,

though it were slit; (M;) as also فَرِيَّةٌ. (K.) ―
-b3-
And A thing forged, or fabricated; (S, K, TA;)
thus [or rather as hence meaning unknown, or

the Kur [xix. 28], (S, TA,) i. e. [Thou hast done]
a thing hitherto unknown; a thing deemed strange:
(Bd:) or a thing of great magnitude or moment
or gravity; (S, K, TA;) and thus it is said to
mean in the phrase above cited: (S, TA:) or
wonderful; (T, TA;) thus as expl. by Er-Rághib; (TA;) and thus it is also said to mean
in that phrase. (T, TA.) ―
-b4-  See also 1, latter
half, in eight places.

A forger, or fabricator, of lies; and so ↓ مِفْرًى.

-A4-  And they say, الفَرِىَّ الفَرِىَّ,
meaning العَجَلَةَ العَجَلَةَ [i. e. Haste: haste: used
in an imperative sense; as inf. ns. are often thus
used; but they are] both like غَنِىّ [in measure]:
mentioned by Sgh. (TA.)
أَفْرَى الفِرَى occurs in a trad. as meaning The
most lying of lies: الفِرَى is the pl. of فِرْيَةٌ. (TA.)
مِفْرَّى: see فَرِىٌّ.
مَفْرِيَّةٌ A مَزَادَة [or leathern water-bag] made in
a good, or proper, manner; well made. (T, TA.)
