[They (referring to women) poured desirous love
into the heart; then they gave him to drink the
remains of the water of grief, by looking with the

فَرَّغْنَ, by poetic license, for the sake of the metre]:
(TA:) إِفْرَاغَةٌ signifies A single act of إِفْرَاغ; and
hence the trad. كَانَ يُفْرِغُ عَلَى رَأْسِهِ ثَلَاثَ إِفْرَاغَاتٍ
[He used to pour upon his head three pourings].
(TA.) ―

are there indicated, but not expressed; and are
well known:]) one says, تفرّغ لِلْعِبَادَةِ [He applied
himself exclusively to religious service]: (Msb in
art. بتل:) and تَفَرَّغْتُ لِلْأَمْرِ means [also, simply,]
تَصَدَّيْتُ لَهُ [i. e. I addressed, or applied, or
directed, myself, or my regard, or attention, or

latter, of g in Pegasus together with the bright
star in the head of Andromeda; as is shown by
what here follows:] the Arabs name الدَّلْوُ the

both Pegasus and Andromeda: (Kzw, descr. of
Pegasus:) [these two pairs of stars are what are
commonly known as the فَرْغَانِ; and are plainly
indicated by the periods assigned to the auroral
settings thereof: but the periods assigned to their
auroral risings would lead us to apply the appel-lation of the فرغان to some other stars, not easily
determinable, in Aquarius: see نَوْءٌ: and see also
مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ, in art. نزل.] The pl. الفُرُوغُ is said
