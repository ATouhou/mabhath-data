فيظ1
فَاظَ, aor. يَفِيظُ, inf. n. فَيْظٌ (ISk, T, S, M, K)
and فُيُوظٌ and فَيَظَانٌ (S, M, K) and فَيْظَانٌ (Lh,
TA) and فَيْظُوظَةٌ, (Lth, M, K,) He (a man, S)
died; (ISk, T, S, M, K;) as also, (sometimes, S)
↓ فَاظَ, aor. يَفُوظُ, inf. n. فَوْظٌ (ISk, T, S, M, K) and
فَوَاظٌ; (S, K, TA; but in the CK, فُوَاظٌ, and
there said to be with damm;) or, accord. to IJ,
only the inf. n., فَوْظٌ, of the latter verb is used,
though the verb itself is allowable on the ground
of analogy. (M.) You say also, حَانَ فَيْظُهُ and
↓ فَوْظُهُ, [in the CK فُوْظُهُ,] The time came for his
dying. (M, K.) In like manner, (S,) you say
also, فَاظَتْ نَفْسُهُ His soul departed, or went forth;
Lth, T, S, M;) on the authority of AO and Ks;
and the like is related on the authority of AZ;
(S;) aor. تَفِيظُ, (M,) inf. n. فَيْظٌ (Lth, T, M) and
فَيْظُوظَةٌ; (Lth, T;) and [accord. to some,] فَاظَتْ
نَفْسُهُ, inf. n. فَوْظٌ: (M:) or, when the نفس is
mentioned, you say, فَاضَتْ, with ض: (K:) As
says, I heard Aboo-'Amr Ibn-El-'Alà say that one
should not say فَاظَتْ نَفْسُهُ, (T, * S, M, *) but فاظ,
(S, M,) meaning “ he died; ” and not فَاضَ, with
ض, decidedly; (S;) or not فَاضَتْ: (T:) [but
what was said by As respecting these two verbs
has been stated more fully, and variously, in art.
فيض, q. v.:] AO says that فاظت نَفْسُهُ is of the
dial. of Keys; and فاضت, of the dial. of Temeem:
Fr says that the people of El-Hijáz and Teiyi say
the former; and Kudá'ah and Temeem and Keys
say the latter: AHát says, I heard AZ say that
Benoo-Dabbeh alone say the latter; and ElMázinee relates the like on the authority of AZ.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  You say also, فَاظَ نَفْسَهُ, (Ks, S, M, K,)
aor. يَفِيظُ, (Ks, T,) He vomited forth his soul:
(Ks, S, M, K:) the verb being trans. as well as
intrans. (Ks, S.)
4
افاظهُ He (God) caused him to die. (K, TA.)
And you say also, ضَرَبْتُهُ حَتَّى أَفَظْتُ نَفْسَهُ [I beat
him, or smote him, until I made his soul to depart,
or go forth]. (S.) And لَأُفِيظَنَّ نَفْسَكَ [I will assuredly cause thy soul to depart, or go forth]
(M.) And افاظهُ اللّٰهُ نَفْسَهُ [God caused him to
vomit forth his soul]. (Ks, T, S, M.)
تفيّظوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ They constrained themselves to
vomit forth their souls. (S, TA.) [But in one
copy of the S, I find يُفِيظُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ, expl. as
meaning They cause to vomit forth their souls;
which suggests that the right reading may perhaps
be يُفِيظُوا: or it may be يَفِيظُوا, from فَاظَ نَفْسَهُ.]
