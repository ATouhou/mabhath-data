فطحلالفِطَحْلُ, (S, O, K,) and accord. to the expositors of the Fs, الفَطَحْلُ also, (TA,) [or زَمَنُ
الفَطَحْلِ,] A [or the] time in which mankind had
not as yet been created (لَمْ يُخْلَقْ فِيهِ بَعْدُ): (S, O,
K:) or the time of Noah: (K:) or a [or the]
time in which the stones were moist, or soft: (S,
O, K:) thus said Ru-beh, when asked respecting
it; (TA;) and thus the Arabs of the desert
accord. to AO: (S, O, TA:) a poet said,
زَمَنَ الفِطَحْلِ إِذَاالسِّلَامُ رِطَابُ
[In the time of the فطحل, when the stones were
moist, or soft]: (TA:) and El-'Ajjáj is related to
have said, (S,) or, correctly, Ru-beh, as in the O,
or Ru-beh Ibn-El-'Ajjáj, in replying to a woman
whom he desired to take to wife, and who had
asked him what was his age, and what was his
property, &c., (TA,)
فَقُلْتُ لَوْ عُمِّرْتُ عُمْرَ الحِسْلِ
أَوْ عُمْرَ نُوحٍ زَمَنَ الفِطَحْلِ
وَالصَّخْرُ مُبْتَلٌّ كَطِينِ الوَحْلِ
صِرْتُ رَهِينَ جَدَثٍ أَوْ قَتْلِ
[And I said, If I were made to live the life of
the new-born young one of the dabb (which is said
to be seven hundred years), or the life of Noah
in the time of the fitahl, when the rocks were moist
like the clay of the mire, I should become the
pledge of a grave or of slaughter]: (S, * O, TA:
but the last has هَرَمٍ in the place of جَدَثٍ:) and
one says, كَانَ ذٰلِكَ زَمَنَ الفِطَحْلِ [That was in
the time of the fitahl]; a prov., in which the last
word is said to have the first, or the third, of the
meanings expl. in this art.; and which is said of
a thing that happened long ago; (Meyd: [see
also Freytag's Arab. Prov. ii. 340:]) and أَتَيْتُكَ
عَامَ الفِطَحْلِ, and الهِدَمْلَةِ, expl. by AHn as meaning [I came to thee] in the time [or year] of
abundance of herbage, and of food and drink.
