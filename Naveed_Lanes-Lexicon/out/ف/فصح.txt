فصح1
فَصُحَ, (S, A, Mz in the 9th نوع, and so in
some copies of the K as stated in the TA,) [aor.
فَصُحَ,]
inf. n. فَصَاحَةٌ, (KL,) or فَصْحٌ; (Mz ubi suprà,
on the authority of Er-Rághib;) or ↓ فصّح; (so
in other copies of the K;) or the latter also; (A;)
and ↓ افصح; (A, K, Mz;) said of milk, It became divested of the froth, (S, A, K, Mz,) which
is the primary signification accord. to Er-Rághib;
(Mz;) and clear of its biestings: (A:) or ↓ افصح
has this latter signification. (S, L, K.) And
فَصْحٌ, accord. to Er-Rághib, signifies [also] A
thing's becoming clear of what was mixed with it.

فَصُحَ,] inf. n. فَصَاحَةٌ (S,
K) and فَصْحٌ, (K,) (tropical:)  He (a man) was, or became,
good in his language, or dialect; a metaphorical
signification from the same verb as said of milk;
so accord. to Er-Rághib: (Mz: see also 4: [and
see فَصَاحَهٌ below:]) or he (a foreigner) was, or
became, good and correct in his language, or dialect: (S, Msb:) or he [a man] was, or became,
clear, perspicuous, or distinct, in speech, or language: and he (a foreigner) spoke Arabic intelligibly: but this signification seems to belong
more properly to أَفْصَحَ, q. v.:] or he [a man] was
an Arab [by birth, and therefore in speech], and
he increased in فَصَاحَة [q. v.]; like ↓ تفصّح: (K:)
and he was, or became, eloquent; (L;) thus used
as syn. with بَلُغَ [from which it is properly distinct]. (MF.)
-A2-  قَدْ فَصَحَكَ الصُّبْحُ [is said to
mean] (assumed tropical:)  Daybreak has become apparent to thee,
and its light has overcome thee: (K, * TA:) and

-b4-  And
[hence] افصح signifies also (tropical:)  He spoke with
فَصَاحَة; (K, TA;) [i. e. clearness, perspicuousness, or distinctness; accord. to the explanation
of فصاحة in the K, and the usage of this verb in
numerous exs.; or with chasteness, or correctness;]
as also افصح الكَلَامَ and افصح بِهِ, and افصح
القَوْلَ; but when the verb became in frequent use,
and commonly known, the objective complement
became dropped, as in the case of أَحْسَنَ, &c.:

TA,) to another; (A, TA;) without indistinctness, or without concealment: (TA:) [and] (tropical:)  he

not so correctly, use these two verbs in the converse manner: or he spoke clearly, or intelligibly,
and then became chaste, or good and correct, or
eloquent, in his speech, or language]. (A.) And
افصح is also used in poetry as signifying (assumed tropical:)  He
(an animal not endowed with speech) uttered a
sound, or cry, clearly. (L.) And one says, افصح
عَنْ شَىْءٍ, inf. n. إِفْصَاحٌ [in this and the preceding

use of the faculty of فَصَاحَة: or, as some say, [but
accord. to general analogy, this signification seems
to belong more properly to ↓ تفاصح,] he affected
a resemblance to those endowed with that faculty;
[or made a show of فصاحة;] like تَحَلَّمَ as meaning “ he made a show of الحِلْم ” [i. e. “ forbearance,” &c.; in which sense تَحَالَمَ is more commonly used]. (TA.) See also 1, latter part.

of letters and from strangeness and from contrariety to analogy [not sanctioned by frequency
of usage among the Arabs of pure speech; (KT,
and Mz in the 9th نوع;) [for] the point upon
which it turns is the frequency of the use of a
word by the Arabs [of pure speech]; (Mz ibid.;)
a word being known to have this quality by its
being frequently used by the Arabs in whose
Arabic confidence is placed, or by its being used
by them more frequently than one synonymous
