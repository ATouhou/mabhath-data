فرسخفَرْسَخٌ, mentioned, but not explained, by J [in
the S], (K,) [A parasang, or league;] three
Háshimee miles (أَمْيَال هَاشِمِيَّة [see مِيلٌ]): or
twelve thousand cubits: or ten thousand cubits:
(K:) three miles of the Háshimee measure, i. e.,
accord. to the Bári' and the T [&c.], twenty-five
bow-shots; twenty-five times the measure termed
غَلْوَةٌ [q. v.]: (Msb:) or three miles, i. e. thirty
bow-shots reckoning the bow-shot as four hundred
cubits, or sixty bow-shots reckoning the bow-shot
as two hundred cubits: (Msb voce مَيلٌ:) the
ancient Greeks said that it is three miles, reckoning these [together] as about sixty bow-shots [of
the shorter measure mentioned above]: (Msb in
the present art.:) or, accord. to some, six miles:
(L: [but this is app. a mistake occasioned by
finding it expl. as consisting of sixty bow-shots
and supposing these to be bow-shots of four hundred cubits each:]) it is [said to be] from the
same word as signifying “ rest,” or “ ease; ” (K,
TA;) because, when a man walks the distance
thus called, he sits down, and rests: or, accord.
to the Msb, from فَرْسَخَةٌ signifying “ width; ” the
word having this meaning, however, is فَرْشَخَةٌ,
with ش: (TA:) [the truth is, that] it is a Pers.
word [فَرْسَنْگ], arabicized: (S, A:) the pl. is
فَرَاسِخُ. (S, A, Msb.) The other meanings of
this word, not mentioned by J, may have been
regarded by him as not of established authority.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  It signifies also An opening, or intervening space, between two things. (K.) ―
-b3-  And
A thing in which is no opening, or intervening
space: as though having two contr. significations. (K.) ―
-b4-  Also A thing that is lasting and
abundant, that does not cease, or come to an end.
(ISh, K.) ―
-b5-  And A long time (K, TA) of the
night or of the day: thus in the saying, اِنْتَظَرْتُكَ
فَرْسَخًا [I looked, or waited, for thee, or I have
looked, &c., a long time &c.]. (TA.) ―
-b6-  And A
سَاعَة [meaning hour or time] (K, TA) of the day:
or a time of the night and of the day: pl. as
above. (TA.) ―
-b7-  And The time, (K, TA,) or
interval, (TA,) between stillness and motion. (K,
TA.) ―
-b8-  And Stillness, or quiet: (K, TA:) a
meaning mentioned by more than one of the
authorities respecting strange words. (TA.) ―
-b9-
And Rest, or ease. (K.)
