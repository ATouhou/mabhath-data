فخت1
فَخَتَتْ, said of a woman, She walked with
an elegant and a proud and self-conceited gait,
with an affected inclining of the body from side to
side. (Msb.) [See also 5.] ―
-b2-  And, said of the
bird called فَاخِتَة, It [cooed, or] uttered a cry or
sound. (K.) ―
-b3-  And فَخَتَ He lied, or uttered a
falsehood. (A, TA. [See فَاخِتَةٌ.])
-A2-  فَخَتَهُ, aor.
فَخَتَ,
He cut it off (K, TA) with a sword. (TA.) ―
-b2-
فَخَتَ رَأْسَهُ He smote his head with a sword, (O,
K, TA,) and cut it off. (TA.) ―
-b3-  فَخَتَ الإِنَآءَ,
(K, TA,) inf. n. فَخْتٌ, (TA,) He uncovered the
vessel. (K, TA.) ―
-b4-  And الفَخْتُ signifies also
The cook's taking out with the hand a piece of
flesh-meat from the cooking-pot: (K, TA:) مِنَ
القِدْرَةِ, the reading found in copies of the K, [in
the CK من الفِدْرَةِ,] is a mistake: it should be
من القِدْرِ, as in the L [and O] &c. (TA.)
5
تفخّت He walked in the manner of the bird
called فَاخِتَة: thus in the K: but in most of the
lexicons تَفَخَّتَتْ: (TA:) i. e. she (a woman)
walked as walks the فَاخِتَة: (A:) [or,] accord. to
Lth, [in the 'Eyn,] signifying مشت مجنبحة:
(TA: in the O, مَشَتْ مجنحه; and in the
margin thereof, مُجَنْبِخَةً: [the right reading is
مَشَتْ مُجْتَنِحَةً; thus in the JK, a lexicon founded
upon the 'Eyn:] thought by him to be from the
walking of the bird called فَاخِتَة: (O, * TA:) he
means, she strode in her walking, and held out her
arms apart from [her sides beneath] her armpits.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  And He wondered, syn. تَعَجَّبَ, (O, K,
TA,) and said, How good, or goodly, is he, or it!
(O, TA.) And it is said of a man as signifying
تعجّب فِى مِشْيَتِهِ [app. meaning He showed عُجْب,
i. e. self-admiration, &c., in his gait: but I do not
find this signification assigned to تعجّب]. (TA.)
―
-b3-  And He affected lying; or lied purposely;
syn. تَكَذَّبَ. (A, TA.)
7
انفخت, said of a roof, It became perforated.
(O, K.)
فَخْتٌ The light of the moon; moonlight: (S,
A, O, K:) or the light of the moon when it first
appears: and hence [as some say] the derivation
of فَاخِتَةٌ [as the name of a certain bird], because
of its colour: (Msb: [see, however, what follows:])
you say, جَلَسْنَا فِى الفَخْتِ [as though meaning
We sat in the moonlight]: (A 'Obeyd, S, O:) but
Sh says, I have not heard الفِخْت except in this
instance; and Aboo-Is-hák states that some one
of the lexicologists says, I know not whether it
be a name of the light of the moon or of its darkness: Abu-l-'Abbás says that the meaning [in the
saying above mentioned] is, in the shade of the
moon [i. e. in the shade of a moonlight-night; and
to this the colour of the فَاخِتَة may be likened].
(TA.)
-A2-  Also The [snare, or trap, &c., called]
فَخّ, (K, TA,) of the sportsman: (TA:) or [a
thing] nearly resembling the فَخّ. (O.)
-A3-  And
Holes, or perforations, of a round form, in a
roof. (O, K.)
فَاخِتَةٌ A certain well-known bird; (K;) of those
having neck-rings [or collars]; (S, O;) a species
of pigeon, marked with a neck-ring: (TA:)
accord. to Ibn-El-Jawáleekee, (IB, TA,) the
name is derived from الفَخْتُ, (IB, Msb, TA,)
meaning “ the light of the moon,” (IB, TA,) or
“ the light of the moon when it first appears; ”
because of its colour: (Msb:) [hence, and from
what will be found stated voce قُمْرِىٌّ, it seems to
be a species of collared turtle-dove, of a dull white
colour, marked with a black neck-ring:] or, as
some say, the word is a part. n. from فَخَتَتْ signifying as expl. in the first sentence of this art.:
(Msb:) the pl. is فَوَاخِتُ. (S, O, Msb.) أَكْذَبُ
مِنْ فَاخِتَةٍ [More lying than a fákhiteh] is a prov.;
because the cry of the فاختة resembles هٰذَا أَوَانُ
الرُّطَبِ [This is the season of the fresh ripe dates];
and this it utters when the spadix of the palmtree has not yet come forth. (Meyd. [See also
Freytag's Arab. Prov. ii. 383.])
