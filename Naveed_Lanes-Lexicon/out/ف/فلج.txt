فُلُجٌّ:]) it is said that the ↓ فَالِج [thus in my copy
of the Mgh, but it is there strangely added that
it is “ with fet-h,” as though فَالَج,] is two fifths
of what is termed الكُرُّ المُعَدَّلُ, [see art. كر,] and,
by 'Alee Ibn-'Eesà, that it is larger than the فِلْج:
in the T, the ↓ فَالِج is said to be the half of the
great كُرّ; and the فِلْج is the measure of capacity that is called in Syriac فَالَغَا. (Mgh.)
فَلَجٌ: see فُلْجٌ, in two places.

lateral incisors, (T, S, O,) when natural; and
تَفْلِيجٌ, distance, or width, between those teeth when
it is the effect of art. (T.) فَلَجٌ in all the teeth
is disapproved, and not at all beautiful; but it is
esteemed goodly when only between the two
middle teeth. (TA.) ―

between the feet, (Lth, O, K, TA,) in the posterior
direction: (O, TA:) or, between the shanks; like

فُلُجٌّ, [thus in the L,] accord. to Sb, A sort of
men: one says, النَّاسُ فُلُجَّانِ The people, or men,
are two sorts; [for ex.,] consisting of entering
and going out: [but I think it most probable that
فُلُجٌّ and فُلُجَّانِ are mistranscriptions for فِلْجٌ and
فِلْجَانِ, for] Seer says that فلج signifying “ a
half ” and “ a sort ” is derived from فِلْجٌ syn.
with قَفِيزٌ: thus he makes فِلْجٌ an Arabic word.
(L.) See also فَلْجٌ.
فِلْجَانٌ, [said to be] from فِلْجٌ signifying “ a
certain measure of capacity,” [but app. from the
Pers. فِنْجَان,] A [small porcelain or earthenware]
cup out of which coffee &c. is drunk; commonly

فَليِجَةٌ One of the oblong pieces of cloth of a
tent: (TA:) or, of a [tent of the kind called]
خِبَآء: (As, S, O, K:) As says, I know not in
what part it is: (TA:) ↓ فَلِيجٌ appears to be
used for it by poetic license; or the word may
be one of those pronounced with and without ة;
or without ة it may be a pl. [or coll. gen. n.] of
which the sing. [or n. un.] is with ة: (M, TA:)
[or] فَلِيجٌ signifies a single oblong piece of a بِجَاد
[q. v.]; and its pl. is فُلُجٌ: (L and TA in art.
بجد:) and [in like manner] ↓ فَلْجَةٌ signifies a

that is brought from Es-Sind for the purpose of
covering: (S, O, * K:) or a camel with two humps,
between the Bukhtee (البُخْتِىّ) and the Arabian:
so called because his hump is divided in halves,
or because his two humps have different inclinations: (L:) pl. of the former فَوَالِجُ. (S, M, K;

flaccidity in one of the lateral halves of the body;
(A;) or a flaccidity in one of the lateral halves
of the body, (K, TA,) arising suddenly, (TA,)
occasioned by an efflux of a phlegmatic humour,
and causing the passages of the spirit to become
obstructed; (K, TA;) this being its first effect;
it deprives the patient of his senses and his motion;
and is sometimes in one member: (TA:) or a
flatus (رِيحٌ S, O, L, TA) which attacks a man,
and deprives him [of the use] of one lateral half
of the body; (thus in the L, and the like is said
in the 'Eyn; TA;) whence it is thus called:
(IDrd, S, O:) or a disease that arises in one of
the lateral halves of the body, occasioning the loss
of the senses and of motion, and sometimes in both
lateral halves, and sudden in its attack; on the
seventh [day] it is dangerous; but when it has
passed the seventh, its acuteness ceases; and when
it has passed the fourteenth, it becomes a chronic
disease: (Msb:) it is called in a trad. of Aboo-Hureyreh دَآءُ الأَنْبِيَآءِ [the disease of the prophets]:
and is said by Et-Tedmuree, in the Expos. of
the Fs, to be a disease that attacks a man when
the venters (بُطُون) of the brain become filled with
certain moistures, or humours, occasioning the loss
of sensation and of the motions of the members,

فِيَالَجَةٌ: see فِلْجَانٌ. [فَيَالِجَة occurs in art. قز
in the TA, as its pl.; being there expl. as meaning small cups (فَنَاجِين) in which wine (شَرَاب) is
drunk: but I think that this may be taken from
a mistranscription for فِيَالَجَة.]

last explanation is said in the K to be erroneous;
but he who is wide between the paps is also wide
