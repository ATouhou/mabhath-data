فتأ1
مَا فَتِئَ, (Fr, * T, Msb, K,) aor.
فَتَاَ, (Fr, T,
Msb;) and ما فَتَأَ, [aor.
فَتَاَ;] (K;) and ما فَتُؤَ,
(Fr, * T, K,) aor.
فَتُاَ; (Fr, T;) He did not cease
[doing a thing; being incomplete, or non-attributive, verbs]; (T, Msb, K;) as also ↓ مَا أَفْتَأَ;
(AZ, T, K;) this last of the dial. of Temeem;
(AZ, T, M;) the first of the dial. of Keys and
others: (AZ, T:) you say مَا فَتِئْتُ أَذْكُرُهُ, (AZ,
T, S, O, Msb, *) or مَا فَتِئْتُ أَفْعَلُ, (M,) and ما
فَتَأْتُ, (AZ, T, S, O, M,) aor.
فَتَاَ, inf. n. فَتْءٌ (AZ,
T, M) and فُتُوْءٌ; (M;) and ما فَتُؤْتُ, aor.
فَتُاَ; (Fr,
O;) and ↓ ما أَفْتَأْتُ; (AZ, T, S, M, O;) I did
not cease [remembering him, or doing such a
thing]: (AZ, T, S, M, O, Msb: *) these verbs
are used only in negative phrases, in this sense;
but sometimes the particle of negation is suppressed, it being, however, meant to be understood; (T, S, M;) as in تَاللّٰهِ تَفْتَأُ تَذْكُرُ يُوسُفَ,
(T, S, O, K,) in the Kur [xii. 85], (T, S, O,)
meaning مَا تَفْتَأُ, (S, O, K,) thus in all the copies
of the K [and in the S and O], but correctly لَا
تَفْتَأُ, [i. e. By God, thou wilt not cease remembering Joseph,] accord. to all the grammarians and
the expositors of the Kur-án: (TA:) for the oath
that is not accompanied by the sign of affirmation
denotes negation. (Bd in xii. 85.) ―
-b2-  And فَتِئَ
عَنْهُ, (O, K,) inf. n. فَتْءٌ, (O,) He forgot it, and
abstained, or desisted, from it; (نَسِيَهُ وَانْقَدَعَ عَنْهُ,
O, and so in some copies of the K; in other
copies of the K انقذع or انفذغ; [both of which
are evidently mistranscriptions;]) namely, an
affair, or event: (O, TA:) or this is used only
in negative phrases. (K.)
-A2-  فَتَأَ, as a complete
[i. e. an attributive] verb, signifies He stilled,
quieted, or made to cease, syn. سَكَّنَ, or, as some
say, (TA,) he abated, or allayed, syn. كَسَرَ, and
extinguished: thus says Ibn-Málik, as on the
authority of Fr; and it is correct: AHei has
erred in charging him with having committed a
mistake: (K, TA:) for he says that it is a mistranscription for فَثَأَ, with the three-pointed ث:
it is mentioned also by IKoot and IKtt: and
Fr states that one says, فَتَأْتُهُ عَنِ الأَمْرِ meaning
I made him to cease (سَكَّنْتُهُ) from the affair: and
فَتَأْتُ النَّارَ meaning I extinguished the fire. (TA.)
