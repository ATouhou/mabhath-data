pl., (see 7, in two places,) signifies rest from grief,
or mourning, or from disease: (TA:) or freedom
from difficulty, distress, or straitness; as also
↓ فُرْجَةٌ: (Msb:) or freedom from anxiety; (S,

↓ فَرْجَةٌ, with fet-h, is an inf. n. [app. of unity];

of the K from the statement in the T, cited
above, that one says, مَا لِهٰذَا الغَمِّ مِنْ فَرْجَةٍ and
فُرجَةٍ and فِرْجَةٍ. (TA.) ―

of the first is فُرَجٌ (Msb, TA) and فُرُجَاتٌ: (TA:)
and it is also in a wall, (S, Msb, K,) and the like:
(S, Msb:) and signifies also an opening, or a
space, or room, made by persons for a man entering among them, in a place of standing or of sitting. (Msb.) One says, بَيْنَهُمَا فُرْجَةٌ, meaning

يُتْرَكُ فِى الإسْلَامِ مُفْرَجٌ, [meaning that he who is
thus termed shall not be left unbefriended among
the Muslims,] is variously explained: As used
to say that it is with ح; and disapproved of the
saying مفرج, with ج: A'Obeyd says, I heard
Mohammad Ibn-El-Hasan say, it is related with
ح and with ج; and he who says مفرج, with ج,
means A slain person found in a desert tract, not
by a town or village, [which signification is mentioned in the K,] the fine for whose blood is to be
paid from the government-treasury: AO says that
it means one who becomes a Muslim and has no
alliance of friendship with any one [among the
Muslims]; wherefore, if he commits a crime,
[such as maiming another, &c.,] the governmenttreasury must make amends for it, because he has
no relations or others bound to aid him by paying
a bloodwit [or the like]: (S, O: and the like is
also said in the Mgh and in the K:) or, accord.
to Jábir El-Joafee, it means a man who is among
a people to whom he does not belong; wherefore
they are bound to pay for him a bloodwit [or the
like]: (O, TA:) or it means one who has no kinsfolk, or near relations: so accord. to IAar: (Mgh,
TA:) or one who has no offspring: or one who
has no wealth, or property: and it is also said to
mean one burdened by the obligation to pay a
bloodwit, or a ransom, or a debt that must be discharged: and [in like manner] ↓ مَفْرُوجٌ is said to
mean one who is burdened with a debt: but it is
correctly with ح [unpointed]; (TA;) [i. e.] such is
termed مُفْرَحْ, with ح: (As, Mgh:) and مُفْرَجٌ
means one burdened by his family, although he be
not in debt. (Az, TA voce مُفْرَحٌ [q. v.].)
مُفْرِجٌ One whose shooting, or casting, has become
altered [for the worse], having been good. (AA,
O, * K.)
