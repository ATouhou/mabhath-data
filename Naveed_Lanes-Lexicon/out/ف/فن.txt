way: (see what follows:)] and a mode, or manner:
(MA:) pl. [of mult.] فُنُونٌ (T, S, M, Msb, K)
and [of pauc.] أَفْنَانٌ. (T, M, K.) One says,
رَعَيْنَا فُنُونَ النَّبَاتِ [We pastured our cattle upon the
various sorts of herbage]: and أَصَبْنَا فُنُونَ الأَمْوَالِ
[We obtained the various sorts of possessions]: and
a poet says,
قَدْ لَبِسْتُ الدَّهْرَ مِنْ أَفْنَانِهِ
كُلُّ فَنٍّ نَاعِمٍ مِنْهُ حَبِرْ
[I have enjoyed of the various sorts of fortune,
every pleasant, soft, sort thereof]. (T.) [↓ أُفْنوُنٌ
has for its pl. أَفَانِيْنُ, which may also be regarded
as pl. of أَفْنَانٌ pl. of فَنٌّ like as it is said to be
a pl. pl. of فَنَنٌ: and] أَفَانِينُ [alone], (S,) or
أَفَانِينُ كَلَامٍ, (TA,) signifies kinds [or sorts], and

and فَيْنَةً مِنَالدَّهْرِ [I was in such and such a state,
or condition, at, or during, a particular time].
(T.)
فُنَّةٌ Much, or abundance, of herbage. (IAar, K.)
فَنَنٌ A branch of a tree: (S, M, Msb, K:) or
such as is of just proportion in length or in breadth:
(T:) said to be syn. with غُصْنٌ; but this latter
signifies “ such as has been cut off ” i. q. قَضِيبٌ
meaning مَقْضُوبٌ: (M:) pl. أَفْنَانٌ; (T, S, M, Msb,
K;) said by Sb to be its only pl.; (M;) occurring
in the Kur lv. 48; where some explain it as pl.
of فَنٌّ, and meaning “ sorts,” or “ species ”; others,
as pl. of فَنَنٌ: (T, Bd:) and أَفَانِينُ is a pl. pl.,
(T, S, K,) i. e. pl. of أَفْنَانٌ. (T, S.) ―
-b2-  And as a
branch shelters like as does darkness, a poet uses
it metaphorically, saying,
أَغَاثَ شَرِيدَهُمْ فَنَنُ الظَّلَامِ
(tropical:)  [The shelter of the darkness aided him, or them,
who fled]. (M.) ―
-b3-  And [in like manner also]
the pl. pl. is used in a trad. describing the
inmates of Paradise, as meaning (tropical:)  Locks of hair;
these being likened to branches: and El-Marrár
says,
أَعَلَاقَةً أُمَّ الوَلِيدِ بَعْدَمَا
أَفْنَانُ رَأْسِكَ كَالثَّغَامِ المُخْلِسِ
(tropical:)  [Dost thou feel attachment of love to Umm-ElWeleed after that the locks of thy head have
become like the hoary thaghám?]; meaning the
locks of the hair of his head when he had become
hoary. (T. [See ثَغَامٌ.])
فَنِينٌ A humour in the armpit [of a camel],
with pain. (M, K.) ―
-b2-  And A camel having the
tumour thus called; as also ↓ مَفْنُونٌ. (M, K.)
شَجَرَةٌ فَنَّآءُ and فَنْوَآءُ, which latter is anomalous,
A tree having branches; (S;) the latter thus expl.
by AA; but by rule it should be فَنَّآءُ: (A'Obeyd,
T:) or the latter, which is anomalous, signifies
having long branches: (M:) or both signify having
many branches. (K.) ―
-b2-  And [hence] اِمْرَأَةٌ فَنْوَآءُ
(assumed tropical:)  A woman having much hair: but in this case,
as in the former, the epithet, by rule, should be
فَنَّآءُ. (M.) [See also فَيْنَانٌ.]
فَنَّانٌ A wild ass that has various sorts, or
modes, of running: (S, K:) used in this sense in
the poetry of El-Aashà. (S.) [See also مِفَنٌّ.]
شَعَرٌ فَيْنَانٌ (assumed tropical:)  Hair having locks [lit. branches
(أَفْنَان)] (M, * K) like the أَفْنَان of trees; [the
latter word properly signifying having many
branches, (see Ham p. 622,) of the measure فَيْعَالٌ,
not فَعْلَان;] therefore it is perfectly decl.: so says
Sb: (M:) or it signifies long and beautiful hair;
the latter word being of the measure فَيْعَالٌ from
الفَنَنُ, and the ى augmentative. (T.) ―
-b2-  And
one says also, agreeably with analogy, رَجُلٌ فَيْنَانٌ,
(M,) and اِمْرَأَةٌ فَيْنَانَةٌ, (M, K,) meaning [A man,
and a woman,] having much hair; (K;) for
فَيْنَان is perfectly decl., derived from أَفْنَانُ الشَّجَرِ:
IAar has mentioned اِمْرَأَةٌ فَيْنَى meaning [a
woman] having much hair; and if the phrase be
thus, فَيْنَان must be imperfectly decl.; but [ISd
says] I regard this as a mistake of IAar. (M.)
[See also art. فين.]
أُفْنُونٌ: see فَنٌّ, in two places.
-A2-  Also A
tangled, or luxuriant, or dense, branch. (T, K.)
―
-b2-  And Obscure, indistinct, or confused, speech,

―
-b3-  And A mixed, or confused, run, of a horse
and of a she-camel. (T, K.)
-A3-  Also A serpent.
(T, M, K.) ―
-b2-  And An old woman: so some
say: (M:) or an old woman advanced in age:
(T, K:) or one who is flaccid, or flabby: (K:)
Yaakoob has explained it as having the first of
these three meanings; but IB regards this as
improbable, because a verse of Ibn-Ahmar which
is cited as an ex. thereof is preceded by what
shows that it is applied to his beloved. (TA.)
[It is said in the M to be also the proper name
of a certain woman; and as such it may be used
by Ibn-Ahmar.] ―
-b3-  And i. q. دَاهِيَةٌ [A calamity,
or misfortune, &c.]: (M, K:) so some say. (M.)
-A4-  And The first part of youth, or youthfulness;
and of clouds. (M, K.)
مِفَنٌّ A man who has various sorts, or modes,
[i. e. diversities, or varieties,] of speech; (T, TA;)
and so ↓ مُتَفَنِّنٌ: (S:) or a man who utters, or
performs, wonderful things: (S, K, TA:) fem.
with ة. (T, S, K.) ―
-b2-  And A horse that performs various sorts, or modes, of running. (TA.)
مُفَنَّنٌ A garment, or piece of cloth, diversified;
not uniform. (M, TA.) ―
-b2-  And Old, and evil in
disposition, as an epithet applied to a man: (M:)
and so with ة applied to a woman. (M, K.) ―
-b3-
Also, with ة, A she-camel that seems to one to
have been ten months pregnant, ثُمَّ تَنْكَشِفُ مَنَ
الكِشَافِ [app. meaning then suffers, or exposes,
herself to be compressed; from الكِشَافُ as inf. n.
of كَشَفَت said of a she-camel: compare تنكشف
as here used with تَكْتَشِفُ said of a woman]. (K.)
مَفْنُونٌ: see فَنِينٌ.
مُتَفَنِّنُ: see مِفَنٌّ.
