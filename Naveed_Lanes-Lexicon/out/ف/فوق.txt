فوّقهُ, inf. n. تَفْوِيقٌ, He made him, or judged
him, to excel, or to have excelled. (TA.)
-A2-  فوّق

camel to drink the quantities of milk that had
collected in the udder between two milkings time
after time. (S, O, K, TA. [See فُوَاقٌ.]) ―

بِرِّهِ (tropical:)  [He made me to obtain on repeated occasions
the things wished for, and nourished me with the
recurrent supplies of his bounty]. (TA.) And it
is said in a trad. of 'Alee, إِنَّ بَنِى أُمَيَّةَ لَيُفَوِّقُونَنِى
تُرَاثَ مُحَمَّدٍ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  [Verily the sons of
Umeiyeh] give to me by little and little of the property [constituting the heritage of Mohammad].
(TA.) ―
-b3-  See also 10.

And [hence,] فوّق المَرْأَةَ (assumed tropical:)  He slit the vulva of the
woman. (TA in art. سوس.) ―
-b3-  See also the next
paragraph, last sentence.
4
إِفَاقَةٌ, (O, K, TA,) some say, (O, TA,) signifies A resting; (O, K, TA;) from ↓ فُوَاقٌ signifying a resting between two milkings; (O, TA;)
which latter meaning, as well as the former, the
K erroneously assigns to the former word. (TA.)
―
-b2-  And أَفَاقَتْ said of a she-camel, signifies the
same as فَاقَتْ expl. above: see 1, latter half, (O,
K, TA.) ―
-b3-  And [hence, perhaps,] افاق مِنْ
مَرَضِهِ, (S, O, K, TA,) and مِنْ سُكْرِهِ, (S, O,) and
مِنْ غَشْيَتِهِ, (O, TA,) inf. n. إِفَاقَهُ; (TA;) and
↓ استفاق; both signify the same; (S, O, K;) i. e.
He returned to a healthy, or sound, state [of body
and of mind, from his disease, and from his intoxication, and from his swoon, or fit of insensibility]: (O, K, TA:) or one says of the diseased,
افاق and ↓ استفاق meaning he became convalescent;
or recovered, but not completely, his health and
strength: and the subst. [or quasi-inf. n.] is ↓ فُوَاقٌ:
(TA:) and one says of the insane, or possessed,
افاق, inf. n. إِفَاقَةٌ, meaning he recovered his intel-ligence; and of the intoxicated, likewise, افاق,
originally افاق مِنْ سُكْرِهِ, like as one says اِسْتَيْقَظَ
مِنْ نَوْمِهِ: (Msb:) [and it is said that] ↓ الاِسْتِفَاقَةُ
as syn. with الإِفَاقَةُ is derived from فَوْق meaning
the contr. of تَحْت, like as تَعَلَّى مِنْ مَرَضِهِ and
تَمَاثَلَ are from العُلُوُّ and المُثُولُ: (Har p. 132:)
but accord. to 'Alee Ibn-'Eesà, ↓ استفاق signifies
he sought, or desired, الإِفَاقَة. (Ham p. 541.) ―
-b4-
And [hence,] افاق الزَّمَانُ (tropical:)  The time became abundant in herbage after barrenness or drought. (O,
K, TA.)
-A2-  أَفَقْتُ السَّهْمَ, (inf. n. إِفَاقَةٌ, Msb,) I
put the فُوق [or notch] of the arrow upon the bowstring, (S, O, Msb, * K,) to shoot with it; (S, O,
Msb;) as also أَوْفَقْتُهُ: but أَفْوَقْتُهُ is extr., (S, O,
K,) and should not be said, (S, O,) or, accord. to
Yoo, one says أَفْوَقْتُهُ also: (O:) and, accord. to
the A, السَّهْمَ ↓ فوّق signifies [in like manner] he
put the bow-string into the notch of the arrow on
the occasion of shooting. (TA.)
5
تفوّق عَلَى قَوْمِهِ He exalted himself above his
people, or party. (O, * K, * TA.)
-A2-  تفوّق said
of a young unweaned camel, He drank [or
sucked] the quantities of milk that had collected
in the udder between two milkings time after time.
(S, O, K.) ―
-b2-  And تَفَوَّقَهَا He milked her, namely,
a camel, drawing from her the quantities of milk
that had collected in her udder time after time;
(O, K;) as also ↓ استفاقها. (K. [But see this
latter below.]) ―
-b3-  Hence the trad. respecting
Aboo-Moosà, that he was discoursing with
Ma'ádh, of reciting the Kur-án, and said, أَمَّا أَنَا
فَأَتَفَوَّقُهُ تَفَوُّقَ اللَّقُوحِ [As for me, I draw it forth
in the manner of the drawing forth of the milk of
the milch camel at the times when it has collected
in her udder], meaning (tropical:)  I do not recite my set
portion at once, but piecemeal, in my night and
my day. (S, O, TA.) ―
-b4-  One says also تفوّق
شَرَابَهُ i. e. (tropical:)  He drank his wine, or beverage, part
after part. (TA.) Sb has mentioned that يَتَجَرَّعَهُ
and يَتَفَوَّقَهُ are said of that which is not a labouring to do a thing at once, but is an act after an
act, performed in a leisurely manner. (O, TA.)
7
انفاق It (a thing) broke, or became broken;
quasi-pass. of فَاقَ الشَّىْءَ meaning كَسَرَهُ. (TA.)
―
-b2-  See also 1, near the end. ―
-b3-  Said of a camel,
He became lean, or emaciated: ―
-b4-  and He
perished, or died. (O, K.)
8
افتاق He was, or became, poor, or in want,
or need: (S, O, Msb, K:) فَاقَ in this sense is
not allowable. (S, O.)
-A2-  And He died with
much فُوَاق [which may here mean either hiccoughing (which often occurs at the close of a
fatal fever &c.), or gasping, or short catching of
the breath]. (O, K.)
10
إِسْتَفْوَقَ see 4, in four places.
-A2-  استفاقها: see 5.
[It signifies as there explained: or it signifies, or
signifies also,] He delayed the milking her, namely,
a camel, until her milk collected in her udder, or
in order that it might collect; and so ↓ فوّقها, inf. n.
تَفْوِيقٌ. (TA.) One says, اِسْتَفِقِ النَّاقَةَ Milk not
thou the she-camel before the time. (O, * K.) ―
-b2-
―
-b3-  And مَا يَسْتَفِيقُ مِنَ الشَّرَابِ He does not abstain
[from drinking wine]: (O, K, TA:) or he does
not drink it in the set time: or he does not appoint
a time for drinking it, but drinks it always.
(TA.)
فَاقٌ A [large bowl such as is termed] جَفْنَة,
filled with food. (Lth, T, O, K.)
-A2-  And Cooked
olive-oil. (O, K, TA.) So in the saying of Shemmákh, (O, TA, *) describing the hair of a woman,
(TA,)
قَامَتْ تُرِيكَ أَثِيثَ النَّبْتِ مُنْسَدِلًا
مِثْلَ الأَسَاوِدِ قَدْ مُسِّحْنَ بِالقَافِ
[She stood showing to thee hair abundant and
luxuriant, or abundant and long, in respect of
growth, let down, like the black serpents that have
been anointed with cooked olive-oil]: or, as some
say, meaning الأَنْفَاق, meaning fresh olive-oil [from
إِنْفَاق, a Pers. word signifying “ olive-oil ”]: or,
as AA relates it, the poet said, قَدْ شُدِّخْنَ بِالفَاقِ
[that have been crushed in the فاق]; and accord.
to him the last word has the meaning here next
following. (O, TA.)
-A3-  And The desert; syn.
صَحْرَآءُ: (O, K, TA:) so says AA: and on one
occasion he says that الفاق means a certain land:
(O: a meaning also mentioned in the K:) or a
certain wide land. (TA.)
-A4-  It is also expl. as
signifying بَان [i. e. Oil of ben]: and also A
comb: on the authority of Th: and it may have
either of these meanings in the verse cited above.
(TA.)
-A5-  And accord. to the K, it signifies Tall,
and incongruous in make; and so ↓ فُوقٌ and ↓ فُوقَةٌ
and ↓ فِيقٌ and ↓ فُوَاقٌ and ↓ فُيَاقٌ: but these words
are all correctly, in this [or a similar] sense with
two káfs. (TA.)
-A6-  Also, accord. to the K, A
certain aquatic bird, long in the neck: but this,
likewise, is correctly with two káfs. (TA.)
فَوْق is the contr. of تَحْت; (S, Mgh, O, Msb,
K;) [primarily signifying The location that is
above, or over;] and is an adv. n. (Mgh, Msb,
K) of place; (Mgh, Msb;) and a simple noun,
indecl., [with dammeh for its termination, when
the noun to which it should be prefixed is suppressed, and the meaning of this is intended to
be understood, but not the word itself;] but when
it is prefixed to another noun [which is either
expressed or itself (and not merely its meaning)
meant to be understood, and when the noun to
which it should be prefixed is suppressed and
neither this nor its meaning is meant to be understood,] it is declinable. (K. [For the words
يَكُونُ اسْمًا وَظَرْفًا مَبْنِىٌّ, the reading of the K in
the TA and CK, my MS. copy of the K (which
I follow in this case) has يكون ظرفا واسما مبنيّا.])
One says, زَيْدٌ فَوْقَ السَّطْحِ [Zeyd is above, or rather
upon, the house-top]. (Mgh, Msb.) And العِمَامَةُ
فَوْقَ الرَّأْسِ [The turban is above, or upon, the
head]. (Mgh.) And طَفَا فَوْقَ المَآءِ It floated upon
the water. (S &c. in art. طفو.) Ks has mentioned
the saying, أَفَوْقَ تَنَامُ أَمْ أَسْفَلَ [Dost thou, or wilt
thou, sleep in the part that is above of the house
&c., or in the part that is below? i. e., in the
upper part, or in the lower part?] with fet-h, as
suppressing the noun to which فوق is [meant to
be understood as] prefixed. (TA.) Lth says that
he who uses it as a صِفَة [by which (like other old
writers) he means an adv. n. of place] should use
the accus. case, as when one says, عَبْدُ اللّٰهِ فَوْقَ
زَيْدٍ ['Abd-Allah is above Zeyd]: but if you make
it simply a noun, you use the nom. case, and say,
فَوْقُهُ رَأْسُهُ [His superior (meaning upper) part is
his head]; for in this instance it is the head itself,
and you make each to be governed in the nom.
case by the other. (TA.) In the saying in the
Kur [xvi. 28], فَخَرَّ عَلَيْهِمُ السَّقْفُ مِنْ فَوْقِهِمْ [And
the roof fell on them from above them], the
utility of the phrase من فوقهم is hardly apparent,
because عليهم sometimes serves in its stead: but
IJ says that من فوقهم may here have a useful
office; for عَلَى is sometimes used in relation to
deeds [or events] that are difficult, and deemed
onerous; [for instance,] you say, قَدْ سِرْنَا عَشْرًا
وَبَقِيَتْ عَلَيْنَا لَيْلَتَانِ [We have journeyed ten nights
and the journeys two nights have remained as
though incumbent on us]; &c.; so that if it
were said فخرّ عليهم السقف without the adding
من فوقهم, it might be supposed to be like the
saying عَلَيْهِمْ دَارُهُمْ قَدْ خَرِبَتْ [Their abode had
become in a state of ruin as a punishment upon
them]; but when He [referring to God] says من
فوقهم, that meaning which was supposable ceases
to be so; and the meaning becomes this, that it
[the roof] fell when they were beneath it. (TA.)
إِذْ جَاؤُوكُمْ مِنْ فَوْقِكُمْ وَمِنْ أَسْفَلَ مِنْكُمْ [When
they came to you from above you and from below
you], in the Kur [xxxiii. 10], relates to Benoo-
Kureydhah, who came to them from above them;
and to Kureysh and Ghatafán, who came from
the district of Mekkeh, from below them. (TA.)
وَالَّذِينَ اتَّقُوا فَوْقَهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ, in the Kur [ii. 208],
means (assumed tropical:)  [But those who have been careful of their
religious duties] shall be above them in station [on
the day of resurrection]. (O.) And one says,
[agreeably with what has been stated in the first
sentence of this paragraph, أَخَذَهُ مِنْ فَوْقُ, and
أَخَذَهُ مِنْ فَوْقٍ, [meaning (assumed tropical:)  He overcame him, or
overpowered him, and in like manner أَتَاهُ من
فوق, as expl. in the Ham p. 128. i. e. قَهَرَهُ
namely, his adversary; and so a hawk, his pr?
or quarry. (M and K in an expl. of أَدَلَّ عَلَيْه, in
art. دل.) And [in a similar manner] فَوْق is metaphorically used as denoting excess, (Mgh, Msb.)
and excellence: (Msb:) thus one says, العَشَرَةُ فَوْقَ
التِّسْعَةِ (Mgh, Msb) i. e. (tropical:)  Ten is above nine;
meaning ten exceeds nine: (Msb:) and هٰذَا فَوْقَ
ذَاكَ (Mgh, Msb) i. e. (tropical:)  [This is above, or superior
to, that;] meaning this is more excellent than that;
(Msb:) and hence, (Mgh, Msb,) in the Kur iii.
24], (S, O,) بَعُوضَةً فَمَا فَوْقَهَا i. e. (tropical:)  [A gnat and]
what exceeds it (Mgh, Msb) in smallness, or in
largeness; (Mgh, Msb, K;) what is smaller than
it, (AO, S, O,) or what is larger than it, by the
latter being meant the fly [mentioned in the Kur
xxii. 72] and the spider [mentioned in xxix. 40],
(Fr, S, O,) and the phrase as expl. in the former
sense being like the reply to him who says “ Such
a one is small ” ذٰلِكَ وَفَوْقَ i. e. (assumed tropical:)  And smaller than
that: (AO, O:) hence also, in the Kur iii. 12],
فَإِنْ كُنَّ نِسَآءً فَوْقَ اثْنَتَيْنِ (Mgh, Msb) i. e. (tropical:)  [And
if they are women,] exceeding two. (Msb.)
فُوقٌ The part, of the arrow, which is the place
of the bow-string; [i. e. the notch thereof;] (S,
O, Msb, K;) as also ↓ فُوقَةٌ: (Msb, K;) the
former is masc., and also, like the latter, fem.
(IAmb, Msb:) and الفُوقَانِ signifies the (??)
[or two cusps of the فُوق, between which is put the
bow string]; (O, K;) thus these are termed by
the tribe of Hudheyl; but a poet who has used
the dual form is said by AO to has mead
thereby a single فُوق: (O:) the pl. [of mult.] is
فُوَقٌ and [of pauc.] أَفْوَاقٌ; (S, O, Msb, K;) or,
accord. to ISk, these are pls. of فُوقَةٌ; (TA;)
and قُفًا also is a pl., formed by transposition;
[see an ex. in a verse cited voce عُرْقُوبٌ;] (K,
TA;) one says فُقْوَةٌ and فُقًا [for فُوقَةٌ and فُوَقٌ].
(TA.) سَهْمٌ ذُو فُوقٍ means An arrow rendered
complete by its having a فُوق: ―
-b2-  and hence ذَا
فُوقٍ occurring in a trad. [as meaning (assumed tropical:)  A complete share; for سَهْمٌ signifies “ a share ” as well
as “ an arrow ”]. (A'Obeyd, O.) And أَعْلَاهُمْ
فُوقًا, meaning (tropical:)  He, or they, of them, haring the
largest share of religion, is a metaphorical phrase,
from the فُوق of the arrow. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And they
say, أَقْبِلْ عَلَى فُوقِ نَبْلِكَ, [or, app., فُوَقِ نَبْلِكَ, for
نَبْلٌ is a coll. n., meaning “ arrows,” or “ Arabian arrows,”] meaning (assumed tropical:)  Betake thyself to thy
affair, and that which concerns thee. (TA.) ―
-b4-
And رَمَيْنَا فُوقًا, (O, K,) or فُوقًا وَاحِدًا, (TA,)
meaning رِشْقًا [i. e. (tropical:)  We shot in one direction; or
we shot one bout, in one direction], (O, K, TA.) ―
-b5-
[Hence, app.,] one says, كان فُلَانٌ لِأَوَّلِ فُوقِ, meaning (tropical:)  Such a one (??) [for the first discharge from
the bow, i. e.,] the first shot and dying. (A, TA.)
―
-b6-  And [hence, perhaps.] فُوقٌ signifies also (tropical:)  A
mode, or manner, of speech: (A, O, K:) pl. فُوَقٌ.
(TA) One says to a man when he enters upon
a mode, or manner, of speech, خَذْ فِى فُوقِ أَحْسَنَ
مِنْهُ (tropical:)  [Enter upon a mode, or manner, of speech
better than it]. (A, TA.) ―
-b7-  And (tropical:)  The first
way (AA, O K, TA.) ―
-b8-  Hence. app., [they
say, (??) (tropical:)  Return(??)
(??)
(??)
(??)
(??)
meaning (assumed tropical:)  [What is the case of my wife that she
is choked by her spittle (??) Then, or afterward,]
may it (her spittle) not return to its channel [i. e.
her throat, the way whence it came (??) that she
may be suffocated). (O.) ―
-b9-  And one says (O,
K) or a man when be l(??) gone away, (O,) مَا
ارْتَدَّ عَلَى فُوقِهِ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  He went away and he
did not return [ to the place whence he departed]
(O, K) ―
-b10-  فُوقٌ also signifies, (O, K.) accord. to
Ibn-'Abbád, (O, TA.) (assumed tropical:)  The (??) of a woman:
(O, K. TA) (??) As says that this is with ق [in
the place of the ف]: (TA:) [it is, however, also
said that] فُوقُ الرَّحِمِ signifies (tropical:)  the rima of the
vulva, by way of comparison [to the notch of the
arrow]. (TA, in the supplement to this art.) ―
-b11-
[And app(??) the ear
see 1 (??) art حرم, when it is ment(??) in such
(??) manner as seems to pre(??)
its being a mistranscription for قَوف] ―
-b12-  And

(مَفْرَج, O. TA, (??) the (??) مَخْرَج, TA,
(??) (??) (??)
say, O) the extremity of the tongue. (O, K, TA.)
―
-b13-  And (assumed tropical:)  The uppermost part of the penis, (En-Nadr, O, K, TA,) or of the glans thereof. (TA.)
-A2-  And, accord. to the K, A certain bird; mean

different readings, (S,) the latter the reading of
the Koofees except 'Ásim, and the former that of
the rest, (O,) means (assumed tropical:)  [There shall not appertain

(Ksh:) or any returning, and repeating; (I'Ab,
Ksh, Bd;) from أَفَاقَ “ he (a sick man) returned

her udder; (Ksh;) or because in it [i. e. the فواق]
the milk returns to the udder; (Bd;) i. e. the blast

سُرْعَةٍ [i. e. قَسْمًا صَادِرًا عَنْ سُرْعَةٍ with a dividing
proceeding from quickness]: (Mgh, O: *) or, as
some say, the meaning is, making some of them
[i. e. of those who composed his army] to be more
highly distinguished (↓ أَفْوَق) than others (O, TA *)
in the proportion of their spoils and of the trial
undergone by them. (TA.)

sentence but one.
فُيَاقٌ, mentioned in this art. in the K: see فَاقٌ,

فَوَقَةٌ [an irreg. pl. of فَائِقٌ, like as خَوَنَةٌ is of خَائِنٌ,

An arrow of which the فُوق [or notch] is broken:
(S, O, Msb, K, TA:) [and] an arrow having no
فُوق: (L voce أَقَذُّ:) pl. فُوَقٌ [perhaps a mistranscription for the regular form of pl., i. e. فُوْقٌ; or
it may be that the و is with fet-h to distinguish it
from فُوقٌ signifying “ a notch ” of an arrow]:
but IAar explains this as signifying arrows of
which the heads have fallen. (TA.) One says,
رَجَعَ فُلَانٌ بِأَفْوَقَ نَاصَلٍ (assumed tropical:)  Such a one returned with
an arrow having a broken notch and without a
head upon it; meaning, with an incomplete share
of good fortune: (S, O:) or, disappointed of attaining what he desired, or sought: a proverb.
(TA.) And رَدَدْتُهُ بِأَفْوَقَ نَاصِلٍ (assumed tropical:)  [I turned him
back, or away, with a paltry benefit; or] I made
his share of good fortune to be little, or incomplete.

[or tooth, perhaps meaning cog, though I do not
remember to have met with any description of a
cogged محالة,] has two cusps (فُوقَانِ), (O, K,)
like the فوقان [of the notch] of the arrow. (O.)
[The strangeness of this explanation induces me
to think that فَوْقَآءُ is here a mistranscription for
فَوْهَآءُ, (see مَحَالَةٌ فَوْهَآءُ, in art. فوه,) and that the
explanation is partly conjectural.] ―
-b3-  And كَمَرَةٌ
فَوْقَآءُ A glans of a penis whereof the extremity is
tapering in form, (O, K,) like that which is termed
حَوْقَآءُ. (O.)
مُفِيقٌ and مُفِيقَةٌ A she-camel having in her udder
the milk that had collected between two milkings:
(AA, S, O, K:) pl. مَفَاوِيقُ (S, O, K) and مَفَاوِقُ,
(Akh, TA,) and ↓ فُيُقٌ also is pl. of مُفِيقٌ signifying as expl. above, mentioned by AA in the third
vol. of his “ Nawádir,” and said by IB to be,
accord. to analogy, pl. of فُوُوقٌ, and to be originally فُوُقٌ; but accord. to one relation of a verse
in which it occurs, it is ↓ فِيَق, which is more
agreeable with analogy. (TA.)
-A2-  And the former,
applied to a poet, is syn. with مُفْلِقٌ [i. e. One
who poetizes admirably, or wonderfully.]. (Aboo-Turáb, K. [But its verb is mentioned in the O
and K in art. فيق.])
مُفَوَّقٌ (tropical:)  Food, and beverage, that is taken by little
and little. (IAar, O, K, TA. [See its verb.])
-A2-  Applied to an arrow, [Having a notch made
for the bow-string. (See 2.) ―
-b2-  And] Having
the bow-string put into its notch on the occasion of
shooting: [see 4, last sentence:] ―
-b3-  whence the
saying, لَا زِلْتَ الخَيْرِ مُوَفَّقًا وَسَهْمُكَ فِى الكَرَمِ مُفَوَّقًا
(assumed tropical:)  [Mayest thou not cease to be rightly disposed in
beneficence, and thine arrow made ready with the
bow-string put into its notch in generosity]. (A,
TA.)
مُسْتَفِيقٌ A man who sleeps much: (O, K, TA:)
mentioned by IAar; but this is strange.
