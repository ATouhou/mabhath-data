فَكْرٌ, (Yaakoob, S, O, K, *) which is more chaste
than ↓ فِكْرٌ, [in this case,] (Yaakoob, S, O,) but
the latter is sometimes used, (K,) means I have
no want, or need, of this thing: (Yaakoob, S, O,
K: *) or, as is said in the A, لَا فَكْرَ لِى فِى هٰذَا i. e.
I have no want, or need, of this, nor do I care for
it. (TA.)
فِكْرٌ and ↓ فِكْرَةٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and ↓ فِكْرَى,
(Lth, O, K,) are simple substs., (S, O, Msb, *)
but the last is of rare occurrence, (Lth, O,) signifying Thought, consideration, or [mental] examination, فِى أَمْرٍ [respecting a thing]; (Msb;) consideration [of a thing] in order to obtain a clear
knowledge [of it]; (S, TA;) the employment of
the mind, (M, TA,) or of the consideration, (K,
TA,) upon a thing: (M, K, TA:) or repeated
consideration for the purpose of seeking [to discover] meanings: or the arranging of things in
the mind in order, by them, to arrive at some
object of which the attainment is desired, though
it be but a preponderating opinion: (Msb:) or
the arranging of known things [in the mind] in
order to attain to [the knowledge of] an unknown
[thing]: (KT:) pl. of the first أَفْكَارٌ: (IDrd, K;)
but Sb says that neither فِكْرٌ nor عِلْمٌ nor نَظَرٌ has
any pl.: (TA:) the pl. of ↓ فِكْرَةٌ is فِكَرٌ. (Msb.)
One says, لِفُلَانٍ فِكَرٌ كُلُّهَا فِقَرٌ [Such a one has
thoughts all of which are points of wit]. (A, TA.)
