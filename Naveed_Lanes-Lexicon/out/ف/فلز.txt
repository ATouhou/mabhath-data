فلزفِلِزٌّ (Lth, IDrd, S, A, O, K, &c.) and فِلَزٌّ and
فُلُزٌّ, (Ibn-'Abbád, O, K,) the first of which is
what is commonly known, (TA,) White copper
(نُحَاس أَبْيَض [app. a sort of bronze in which the
relative quantity of the tin is unusually large]
whereof are made cast cooking-pots (Lth, O, K,
TA) of large size, and mortars in which substances are pounded: (TA:) or the metals; gold
and silver and copper and the like: (A'Obeyd, A,
O, K: *) or the substance [i. e. recrement] that is
removed [or blown away] by the blacksmith's
bellows from molten metals: (S, O, K:) or the
dross, or recrement, of iron, (O, K,) that is
removed [or blown away] by the blacksmith's
bellows: (O:) or stones: (O, K:) its primary
meaning is [said to be] hardness, and ruggedness.
(IDrd, O.) الفِلِزَّاتُ [pl. of الفِلِزُّ (not to be mistaken for الفِلَذَاتُ)] signifies The seven metals;
namely, gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, tin [thus
I here render الأُسْرُبّ], and tutenag [thus I render
الخَارصِينِى, following De Sacy and others].
(Kzw.) ―
-b2-  And hence, as being likened to the
فلزّ above described, (TA,) (tropical:)  A strong, hard,
and thick, or coarse, man. (K, * TA.) And (tropical:)  A
niggard: (Ibn-'Abbád, O, K, TA:) as though
he were hard iron, upon which nothing would
make any impression. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And A thing
upon which swords are tested by striking it therewith. (Ibn-'Abbád, O, K.)
