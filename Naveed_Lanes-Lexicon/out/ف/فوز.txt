فوز1
فَازَ, aor. يَفُوزُ, inf. n. فَوْزٌ (S, A, O, Msb, K)
and مَفَازٌ and مَفَازَةٌ, (TA,) He attained, acquired,
gained, or won, good, or good fortune, (S, A, O,
Msb, * K,) or his wish or desire, or what he desired
or sought; (Bd in iii. 182, and TA;) he met
with, or experienced, that for which one would be
regarded with a wish to be in the like condition,
without its being desired that it should pass away
from him; he became far from what was disliked,
or hated, or evil: (TA:) he succeeded, or was successful: he won, or gained the victory: (Msb:)
[he had his arrow drawn, or] his arrow came
forth [from the رِبَابَة], in the game called المَيْسِر:
and (tropical:)  it (an arrow) won; or came forth before its
fellow [or fellows in that game]. (O, * TA.) You
say, فَازَ بِهِ He attained it, acquired it, gained it,
or won it; (Kh, A, O, Msb, K;) namely, good,
or good fortune; (Kh, O;) or reward: (A:)
and he took it away, went away with it. (S, K.)
―
-b2-  He became safe, or secure; he escaped. (S,
A, O, Msb, K.) You say, فَازَ مِنهُ He became
safe, or secure, from it; he escaped it; (A, O,
K;) namely, evil; (TA;) or punishment. (A, O,
TA.) And طُوبَى لِمَنْ فَازَ بِالثَّوَابِ وَفَازَ مِنَ العِقَابِ
A happy end is his who gains reward and escapes
punishment. (A.)
-A2-  And فَازَ, (S, O, K,) aor.
يَفُوزُ, (TA,) inf. n. فَوْزٌ, (S, A, K,) (tropical:)  He perished:
(S, A, K:) he died; and so ↓ فَوَّزٌ: (S, A, O, Msb,
K:) thus the former bears two contr. significations: (A, K:) but IB says that, accord. to some,
the latter is not used in this sense unless preceded
by another phrase such as in the following ex.:
فُلَانٌ بَعْدَهُ ↓ مَاتَ فُلَانٌ وَفَوَّزَ [Such a one died and
such a one died after him]: and accord. to others,
↓ فوّز signifies (tropical:)  he became in the مَفَازَة [or state of
temporary safety] which is between the present life
and that which is to come. (TA.) [This last signification is given in the A.] ―
-b2-  See also 2.
2
فوّز (assumed tropical:)  He went, or his course brought him, to
the مَفَازَة: (IAar, TA:) or (tropical:)  he went upon the
مفازة: (A, TA:) or (assumed tropical:)  he went away. (IAar, O,
K:) or (tropical:)  he went away into the مفازة: (A:) and
↓ فَازَ signifies (assumed tropical:)  he traversed the مفازة. (Msb.)
You say, فوّز بِإِبِلِهِ (S, A, O, K) (tropical:)  He entered upon
the مفازة with his camels. (S, O, K.) ―
-b2-  Also
(assumed tropical:)  He went forth from one land or country to
another: and ↓ تفوّز signifies the same as فوّز.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  See also 1, latter part, in three places.
-A2-  And, said of a road, It was, or became, apparent: (O, K:) and Sgh adds. [but not in the
O,] and it stopped, or came to an end. (TA.)
4
افازهُ بِكَذَا He (God, S, O, K, or a man,
Msb) caused him to attain, acquire, gain, or win,
such a thing. (S, O, Msb, K.)
5
تَفَوَّزَ see 2.
فَازٌ: see what next follows.
فَازَةٌ A [tent such as is called] مِظَلَّة, (S, K.)
with two poles, (K,) or that is extended with a
pole: (S; in which is added, “it is in my opinion
an Arabic word: ”) pl. [or rather coll. gen. n.]
↓ فَازٌ. (ISd, TA.)
فَائِزَةٌ (tropical:)  A thing that rejoices one, and by which
one attains good or the object of his desire: you
say, فَازَ بِفَائِزَةٍ (tropical:)  He attained, acquired, gained, or
won, a thing that rejoiced him, &c. (A, O, * TA.)
مَفَازٌ: see the following paragraph, near the
end.
مَفَازَةٌ A place of safety, security, or escape. (S,
A, O, K.) So in the Kur [iii. 185], فَلَا تَحْسِبَنَّهُمْ
بِمَفَازَةٍ مِنَ العَذَابِ [Do thou by no means reckon
them to be in a place of security from punishment]: (S, A, * O:) or, accord. to Fr, the meaning
here is, far from punishment. (TA.) ―
-b2-  A cause,
or means, of prosperity, or success, or of the attainment or acquisition of that which one desires
or seeks, or of what is good, or of that whereby
one becomes in a happy or good state; syn. مَفْلَحَةٌ.
(A.) ―
-b3-  (tropical:)  [The state of temporary safety which
is between the present life and that which is to
come. See 1, last signification.]
-A2-  (tropical:)  A place of
perdition, or destruction: (Msb, K: *) or i. q. فَلَاةٌ:
(A:) [i. e.] a desert; syn. بَرِّيَّةٌ; any [desert such
as is called] قَفْرٌ: (TA:) or a desert in which is
no water: (ISh, O, K:) and a desert in which is
no water for the space of a journey of two nights
or more: when there is none for the space of a
journey of a night and a day, it is not thus called.
(ISh, O, TA:) or a tract in which two wateringplaces are so far apart that camels are kept from
drinking two days, with a portion of the day preceding them and of the day following them, [accord.
to that which is generally preferred of the explanations of the term رِبْعٌ which is here employed,]
and other animals [that journey quicker] drink on
alternate days; as also فَلَاةٌ: or such as is between
that in which camels are kept from drinking two
days &c. as above, and that in which other animals
drink on alternate days; as also فَيْفَاةٌ: (TA:) so
called to prognosticate good fortune, and safety.
(As, IF, S, A, O, Msb,) as meaning a place of
safety, (A,) from فَازَ signifying “ he became safe: ”
(Msb:) or from فَوَّزَ, (IAar, S, O, * Msb,) or فَازَ.
(AHei, TA.) signifying “ he perished,” (IAar,
S, O, * AHei,) or “ he died: ” (Msb, TA:) AHei
condemns the former of these assertions; but Az
and ISd say that it is the more commonly approved, though the latter is the more agreeable
with analogy: (TA:) or it is so called because
he who comes forth from it, having traversed it,
is safe: (IAar, TA:) the pl. is مَفَاوِزُ: (S:) and
↓ مَفَازٌ signifies the same as مَفَازَةٌ. so in a trad. of
Kaab Ibn-Málik; فَاسْتَقْبَلَ سَفَرًا بَعِيدًا وَمَفَازًا [And
he saw before him, or looked forward to, a far
journey and a desert, or a waterless desert, &c.].
(TA.)
