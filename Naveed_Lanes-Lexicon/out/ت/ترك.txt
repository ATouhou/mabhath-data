ترك1
تَرَكَهُ, (S, M, Msb, K, &c.,) aor.
تَرُكَ, (S, M,)
inf. n. تَرْكٌ (S, M, Msb, K, &c.) and ترْكَانٌ, with
kesr, (Fr, K,) He left it, forsook it, relinquished
it, abandoned it, deserted it, or quitted it; either
intentionally, and by choice, or by constraint, and
of necessity: (Er-Rághib, TA:) he left it, forsook it, &c., as above; namely, a thing that he
desired, or wished for, and also a thing that he
did not desire, or did not wish for: (Ibn-'Arafeh,
TA:) he left it, quitted it, went away from it, or
departed from it; namely, a place: and he left
him, forsook him, relinquished him, abandoned
him, deserted him, quitted him, or separated himself from him: (Msb:) he cast it, or threw it,
away, as a thing of no account; rejected it; discarded it; cast it off; left it off: (MF, TA:)
he left it, left it alone, let it alone; ceased, desisted,
forbore, or abstained, from it; neglected it, omitted
it, or left it undone; syn. خَلَّاهُ; (S, A, O;) or
وَدَعَهُ; (M, K;) as also ↓ اتّركهُ. (K. [But respecting this latter verb, see what follows.]) وَاتْرُكِ
البَحْرَ رَهْوًا, in the Kur xliv. 23, And leave thou
the sea opened with a wide interval; or motionless,
in the same state as before thy passing through it,
and strike it not with thy rod, nor alter anything
thereof; (Bd;) or motionless, parted asunder;
(Jel;) so that the Egyptians may enter it; (Bd,
Jel;) is an instance of the verb meaning leaving
intentionally, and by choice: (Er-Rághib, TA:)
and كَمْ تَرَكُوا مِنْ جَنَّاتٍ وَعُيُونٍ, in the next verse,
How many gardens and springs did they leave!
(Jel,) is an instance of the verb meaning leaving
by constraint, and of necessity. (Er-Rághib, TA.)
In a phrase such as تَرَكَ حَقَّهُ, meaning He made
his right, or due, or claim, to be null, or he rejected
it, and such as تَرَكَ رَكْعَةٌ مِنَ الصَّلَاةِ, meaning
He neglected, omitted, or left unperformed, a
ركعة, of the prayer, [it is said (but I think it
doubtful) that] the verb, having an ideal substantive for its objective complement, is used metaphorically. (Msb.) ↓ قَالَ فِيهِ فَمَا اتَّرَكَ means مَا
تَرَكَ شَيْئًا [i. e. He strove, laboured, or exerted
himself, (اِجْتَهَدَ,) in it, and neglected not, or
omitted not, anything in his power]: the verb is
of the measure اِفْتَعَلَ. (S.) مَنْ أَوْصَى بِالثُّلُثِ وَلَمْ
شَيْئًا ↓ يَتَّرِكْ is a mistake for ولم يَتْرُكْ شَيْئًا, or ولم
↓ يَتَّرِكْ without شَيْئًا, or فَمَا اتَّرَكَ; for this verb is
not trans., except, sometimes, in poetry; and the
meaning is, وَلَمْ يَتْرُكْ فِيمَاأُذِنَ لَهُ فِيهِ شَيْئًا [i. e. He
who bequeaths the third of his property, and does
not omit anything of what he is allowed (to leave,
or anything of the third part, for this is all that
he is allowed to bequeath)]: it is from the saying
↓ فَعَلَ فَمَا اتَّرَكَ [He did such a thing, and neglected
not, or omitted not, anything]. (Mgh.) You say
also, تَرَكَ المَيِّتُ مَالًا, i. e. The deceased left property. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  وَتَرَكْنَا عَلَيْهِ فِى الآخِرِينَ, (K,)
in the Kur [xxxvii. 76 &c.], (TA,) means And
we have perpetuated (K, Jel, TA) to him a eulogy
among the later generations (Jel, TA) of the
prophets and peoples to the day of resurrection,
[namely,] Salutation &c. (Jel.) ―
-b3-  التَّرْكُ is also
syn. with الجَعْلُ, (Lth, K, TA,) in some instances;
(Lth, TA;) as though it had two contr. significations: (K:) [i. e.,] when تَرَكَ is doubly trans., it
has the meaning of صَيَّرَ, (MF, TA,) or جَعَلَ.
(TA.) So in the saying, تَرَكْتُ الحَبْلَ شَدِيدًا I
made, or rendered, the rope strong; or made it,
or caused it, to be, or become, strong. (TA.) So
too in the Kur ii. 16, وَتَرَكَهُمْ فِى ظُلُمَاتٍ And
maketh, or causeth, them to be in darknesses.
(Ksh, Bd, MF.) And sometimes one says of any
action that has come at last to a certain state,
مَا تَرَكْتُهُ كَذَا [I did not make it, or cause it, to
be thus]. (TA.)
-A2-  تَرِكَ, aor.
تَرَكَ, (IAar, K,) inf. n.
تَرْكٌ, (TK,) He (a man, IAar) married, i. e.
took to wife, a تَرِيكَة, (IAar, K,) meaning a
woman that had remained a virgin, unmarried,
until she had become of middle age, or long after
she had attained to puberty, in the house, or tent,
of her parents. (TA.)
3
تاركهُ [inf. n. مُتَارَكَةٌ] is syn. with خَالَاهُ (S
in art. خلو) [which is explained in the K, in art.
خلو, as syn. with تَرَكَهُ, He left, forsook, relinquished, abandoned, &c., him or it; and thus it
may often be well rendered: but it properly signifies he left him, forsook him, &c., being left,
&c., by him; whence it is said in the Mgh, in
art. ودع, that مُوَادَعَةُ is syn. with مُصَالَحَةٌ because
it is مُتَارَكَةٌ: Golius, as on the authority of Ibn-Maaroof, explains تاركهُ as signifying he dismissed
him, and did not molest him: he left him unmolested is one of its meanings, but is not the
primary signification: accord. to the TK, متاركة
signifies the leaving, &c., anything in the state in
which it is: and the leaving, &c., one another].
One says also, تَارَكْتُهُ البَيْعَ, (S, Mgh, but in the
latter تَارَكَهُ, and in the TA فِى البَيْعِ,) وَغَيْرَهُ,
(Mgh,) inf. n. مُتَارَكَةٌ, (S,) [app. meaning I
relinquished with him, i. e. concurrently with him,
the sale, &c.: see 6, by which this rendering is
confirmed: Golius, as on the authority of J, who
has not explained it, says that it means I relinquished to him the merchandise, or commodity;
and Freytag follows him.] ―
-b2-  [Hence,] مُتَارَكَةٌ is
metonymically used as meaning The making peace
[or a truce], or reconciling oneself, with another
or others. (Mgh.) ―
-b3-  In the saying, لَا بَارَكَ اللّٰهُ
فِيِهِ وَلَا تَارَكَ وَلَا دَارَكَ, it is an imitative sequent,
(K,) all of these verbs having the same meaning
[so that the saying may be rendered May God
not bless him nor felicitate him nor make him
happy]: (TA:) [or the meaning may be, nor
preserve him, or prolong his life; for] IAar says
that تَارَكَ means أَبْقَى. (TA.)
6
تَتَارَكُوا الأَمْرَ بَيْنَهُمْ, (K,) or الأَمْرَ فِيمَا بَيْنَهُمْ,
(Mgh,) They relinquished [concurrently], one
with another, the affair that was between them.
(TK.)

―
-b3-  It is said in a trad., جَآءَ الخَلِيلُ إِلَى مَكَّةَ يُطَالِعُ
تَرْكَتَهُ (assumed tropical:)  [El-Khaleel (i. e. Abraham) came to
Mekkeh to get knowledge of his تركة], meaning
Hagar, and her son Ishmael: (K:) the word
originally means an ostrich's egg, and is here
used metaphorically; for the ostrich lays but one
egg in the year, and then leaves it and goes
away: (TA:) Z says, in the Fáïk, that it is thus
related, with the ر quiescent; (Nh, O, TA;) but
it would be a proper way if it were with kesr
to the ر [↓ تَرِكَتَهُ,] as meaning the thing that
he had left, or forsaken, &c. (Nh, O, K.)
تِرْكَةٌ: see what next follows.
تَرِكَةٌ A thing that is left, forsaken, relinquished,

(Msb.)
تَرَاكِ an imperative verbal noun, meaning اُتْرُكْ
[Leave thou, &c.]. (S, TA.) Hence the saying,
تَرَاكِ تَرَاكِ صُحْبَةَ الأَتْرَاكِ [Leave thou, leave thou,
the companionship of the Turks]. (TA.) Yoo
says that تَرَاكَ is a dial. var. of the same; but
this is only when it is used as a prefixed noun,
as in تَرَاكَهَا for تَرَاكِهَا. (TA.)
تَرِيكٌ: see the next paragraph, in two places.
تَرِيكَةٌ A woman that is left unmarried; (S,
K;) that has remained a virgin, unmarried,

―
-b3-  Water left by a torrent: (IB, K:) used in

-b4-  An egg after
the young bird has gone forth from it: (K:) or
an ostrich's egg (S, K) which she forsakes (S, TA)
in the desert after it has become empty: (TA:)

the pl., see the next sentence.] ―
-b5-  (assumed tropical:)  An iron
helmet; (K;) in the opinion of ISd, as being
likened to the egg thus termed; (TA;) and so
↓ تَرْكَةٌ: (S, K:) the pl. [of the former] is تَرَائِكُ
[mentioned in the S as pl. of the former applied
to an ostrich's egg] and ↓ تَرِيكٌ and ↓ تَرْكٌ [the
latter of which is termed in the S pl. of تَرْكَةٌ are
coll. gen. ns. of which تَرِيكَةٌ and تَرْكَةٌ are the
ns. un.]. (K.) ―
-b6-  A raceme of dates (كِبَاسَة [in
the CK, erroneously, كُناسة]) after it has had
what was upon it shaken off, (AHn, K, TA,)
and is left: pl. تَرَائِكُ: (AHn, TA:) and ↓ تَرِيكٌ
signifies a raceme (عُنْقٌود) when what was upon
it has been eaten; (AHn, K, TA;) and a raceme
of dates (عِذْق) that has had what was upon it
shaken off, (K, TA,) so that nothing remains
upon it: so AHn says in one place. (TA.) ―
-b7-  It
is said in a trad., إِنَّ لِلّهِ تَرَائِكَ فِى خَلْقِهِ, meaning

He hath perpetuated in mankind, of hope and
heedlessness, so that they apply themselves thereby
with boldness, forwardness, presumptuousness, or
arrogance, to the things of the present world.

التُّرْكُمَانُ
ترما [The Turkumán;] a certain people,
or race, of the Turks; [absurdly said to be] so
called because two hundred thousand of them
became believers in one month; wherefore they
said لَا تَرَمَا [the Turks of belief]; which was
afterwards contracted into تُرْكُمَانٌ: (K, TA:) [a
coll. gen. n.: n. un., and rel. n., تُرْكُمَانِىٌّ:] pl.
تَرَاكِمَةٌ. (TA.)
