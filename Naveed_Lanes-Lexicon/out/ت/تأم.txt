تَآءَمَ أَخَاهُ, (K, TA, [in the TT, as from the
M, written تَأَمَ, and so by Golius,]) inf. n. مُتَآءَمَةٌ,
(TA,) He was twinborn with his brother. (M,
K, TA.) ―
-b2-  تآءم, (S,) or تآءم ثَوْبًا, (M, K, TA,
[in the TT, again, written تَأَمَ,]) inf. n. as above,
(S, TA,) (assumed tropical:)  He wove a piece of cloth of threads
two and two together (S, M, K) in its warp and
its woof. (K.) [See مِتْآمٌ, and see also نِيرٌ.] ―

as above, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  The horse fetched run after

أَتْأَمَتْ She (a mother, K, or a woman, S,
M, Msb, and any pregnant animal, M) twinned,
or brought forth two at one birth. (T, S, M,
Msb, K.)
-A2-  أَتْأَمَهَا i. q. أَفْضَاهَا [like آتَمَهَا, q. v.
in art. اتم]. (S, K.) [Golius and Freytag have
rendered it as though it meant أَفْضَى إِلَيْهَا.]
تِئْمٌ, whence هُوَ تِئْمُهُ: see تَوْءَمٌ.
تَئِيمٌ, whence هُوَ تَئِيمُهُ: see تَوْءَمٌ.
تُؤَامِيَّةٌ A pearl; (M, K;) so called in relation
to تُؤَامٌ, (TA,) which is a town twenty leagues
from the metropolis of 'Omán, (K, TA,) in the
tract next the sea, (TA,) a city of 'Omán whence
pearls are purchased, (M,) erroneously called by
J تَوْءَمٌ, [but in one copy of the S I find it written
تُوام,] and said by him to be the metropolis of
'Omán; (K;) as also ↓ تَوْءَمِيَّةٌ, (TA, [and thus
it is written in copies of the S, but in one copy I
find it written تُوامِيَّة,]) thought by En-Nejeeremee
to be thus called in relation to the oyster-shell,
because this is always what is termed تَوْءَمٌ, q. v.
(TA.)
تَوْءَمٌ A twin; one of two young, (S, M, Mgh,
Msb, K,) and of more, (M, K,) brought forth at
one birth, (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) of any animals;
whether a male or a female, or a male [brought
forth] with a female; (M, K;) and تَوْءَمَةٌ is
[also] applied to a female: (S, M, Mgh, Msb,
K:) it occurs in poetry contracted into تَوَمٌ:
(M:) the pl. is تَوَائِمُ and تُؤَامٌ, (S, M, Msb, K,)
the latter of which is of a rare form, not without
parallels, (M,) said by some to be a quasi-pl. n.,
and by some to be originally [تِئَامٌ,] with kesr,
but the assertion of these last is condemned by
AHei; (MF;) and تَوْءَمُونَ is allowable as applied
to human beings: (S, TA:) you say, هُوَ تَوْءَمُهُ
[in the TA, erroneously, تُؤْمُهُ, with damm,] and
↓ تِئْمُهُ and ↓ تَئِيمُهُ [in the CK تَيْئمُهُ] (AZ, M,
K) [meaning He is his twin-brother]: and هُمَا
تَوْءَمَانِ (S, * M, Mgh, Msb * K) and تَوْءَمٌ (M, K)
[They two are twin-brothers]: or تَوْءَمٌ applies
only to one of the two; (Msb;) it is a mistake
to say هُمَا تَوْءَمٌ and هُمَا زَوْجٌ: (Mgh:) [but see
زَوْجٌ:] Lth says that تَوْءَمٌ applies to two sons, or
young ones, [born] together; and that one should
not say هُمَا تَوْءَمَانِ, but هُمَا تَوْءَمٌ: this, however,
is a mistake: correctly, as ISk and Fr say, تَوْءَمٌ
applies to one, and تَوْءَمَانِ to two. (T, TA.) It
is of the measure فَوْعَلٌ, (Kh, S, IB, Msb,) in the
opinion of some, (IB,) and originally وَوْءَمٌ, (Kh,
T, S, IB,) like as تَوْلَجٌ is originally وَوْلَجٌ; (Kh,
T, S;) from الوِئَامُ, (T, IB,) “ the being mutually
near,” (T,) “ mutually agreeing,” (T, IB,) “ being
mutually conformable; ” (IB;) so that it means
one that agrees with, or matches, another, (IB.)
―
-b2-  It is metaphorically used in relation to all
things resembling one another [so that it means
(tropical:)  One of a pair]. (M.) A poet says,
قَالَتْ لَنَا وَدَمْعُهَا تُؤَامُ
كَالدُّرِّ إِذْ أَسْلَمَهُ النِّظَامُ
عَلَى الَّذِينَ ارْتَحَلُوا السَّلَامُ
(assumed tropical:)  [She said to us, while her tears fell in pairs,
or in close succession, like large pearls when the
string lets them drop off, Upon those who have
departed be peace]. (S.) [This citation, and what
immediately follows it in the S, mentioning the
pl. تَوْءَمُونَ, not تُؤَامُونَ, have been misunderstood
by Golius; and Freytag has followed him in this
case.] ―
-b3-  التَّوْءَمُ is also [a name of] (assumed tropical:)  A certain
Mansion [of the Moon; namely, the Sixth; more
commonly called الهَنْعَةُ;] pertaining to الجَوْزَآء
[here meaning Gemini]; (M, K;) one of two
[asterisms] called تَوْءَمَانِ: (M:) التَّوْءَمَانِ is (assumed tropical:)  The
Sign of Gemini. (Kzw.) ―
-b4-  [The pl.] تَوَائِمُ also
signifies (assumed tropical:)  Clusters, or what are clustered together,
(مَا تَشَابَكَ,) of stars, and of pearls. (M, K.) ―
-b5-
And تَوْءَمَانِ, (assumed tropical:)  A pair of pearls, or large pearls,
for the ear: each of them is termed a تَوْءَمَة to
the other. (TA.) ―
-b6-  التَّوْءَمَانِ, [in the CK
التَّوْءَمانُ,] (assumed tropical:)  A certain small herb, (AHn, M, K,)
having a fruit like cumin-seed, (AHn, M, and K
in art. وأم,) and many leaves, growing in the
plains, spreading long and wide, and having a
yellow flower. (AHn, TA.) ―
-b7-  التَّوْءَمُ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  The arrow of the kind used in the game
called المَيْسِر: (M:) or a certain arrow of those
used in that game: (K:) or the second of those
arrows; (S, M, K;) said by Lh to have two
notches, and to entitle to two portions [of the
slaughtered camel] if successful, and to subject
to the payment for two portions if unsuccessful.
(M.) ―
-b8-  And تَوْءَمَاتٌ, (assumed tropical:)  A kind of women's vehicles
[borne by camels], (T, K,) like the مَشَاجِر, (T, TA,)
erroneously said in the copies of the K to be like
the مَشَاجِب, (TA,) having no coverings, or canopies: the sing. is تَوْءَمَةٌ. (T, K.)
تَوْءَمِيَّةٌ: see تُؤَامِيَّةٌ.
مُتْئِمٌ Twinning, or bringing forth two at one
birth; (S, M, Msb, K;) applied to a mother,
(K,) or a woman, (S, M, Msb,) and to any pregnant animal; (M;) without ة. (Msb.)
مِتْآمٌ Accustomed to twin, or bring forth two at
one birth; (S, M, K;) applied to a mother, (K,)
or a woman, (S, M,) and to any pregnant animal:
(M:) pl. مَتَائِيمُ. (Har p. 613.) ―
-b2-  Hence, (Har
ubi suprà,) ثَوْبٌ مِتْآمٌ, (S, Har,) or ↓ مُتَآءَمٌ, (TA,
PS,) [both app. correct,] (assumed tropical:)  A piece of cloth woven
of threads two and two together in its warp and
its woof. (S, Har, TA.) ―
-b3-  Hence, also, أَبْيَاتٌ مَتَائِيمُ
(tropical:)  Verses consisting of words in pairs whereof each
member resembles the other in writing. (Har ubi
suprà.) [See also مُتَوْءَمٌ.]
مُتَآءَمٌ: see مِتْآمٌ.
فَرَسٌ مُتَائِمٌ (assumed tropical:)  A horse fetching, or that fetches,
run after run. (S, M.)
تَجْنِيسٌ مُتَوْءَمٌ (assumed tropical:)  The using two words resembling
each other in writing but not in expression; as
in the saying, غَرَّكَ عِزُّكَ فَصَارَ قُصَارُ ذٰلِكَ ذُلَّكَ فَاخْشَ
فَاحِشَ فِعْلِكَ فَعَلَّكَ تُهْدَا بِهٰذَا [Thy might, or
elevated rank, hath deceived thee, and the end of
that has become thine ignominy: fear then thine
exorbitant deed, and may-be thou wilt be made to
follow a right course by this]. (Har p. 269.)
