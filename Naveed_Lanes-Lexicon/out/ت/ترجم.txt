ترجمQ. 1
تَرْجَمَهُ, (S in art. رجم, and Msb and K
in the present art.,) and تَرْجَمَ عَنْهُ, (K,) inf. n.
تَرْجَمَةٌ, (KL,) He interpreted it, (S, Msb, KL,
K,) or explained it in another language; (S,
Msb, KL;) namely, the speech, or language, (S,
Msb, K,) of another person: (Msb:) or, as some
say, translated it from one language into another:
(TA:) and he explained it; namely, his own
speech. (Msb.) [This verb is essentially the same
in Arabic, Chaldee, and Ethiopic.] ―
-b2-  تَرْجَمَهُ, inf. n.
as above, also signifies He wrote his life; wrote
a biography, or biographical notice, of him. (TA,
passim; and other works of post-classical times.)
―
-b3-  Accord. to the K, the ت in this verb is a
radical: but see تَرْجُمَانٌ, below. (TA.)
تَرْجَمَةٌ [inf. n. of the verb above: used as a
simple subst., An interpretation: a translation:
pl. تَرَاجِمُ. ―
-b2-  Also] A life, or biography, or biographical notice, of any person: pl. as above.
(TA, passim; and other works of post-classical
times.) ―
-b3-  And An article, a head, chapter, section, or paragraph, of a book. (TA, passim;
and other works of post-classical times.)
تَرْجُمَانٌ and تُرْجُمَانٌ and تَرْجَمَانٌ, (S in art.
رجم, and Msb and K in the present art.,) of
which three dial. vars. the first is the best, (Msb,)
and is that which commonly obtains, (TA,) An
interpreter; (S, Msb, K;) an explainer of speech
in another language: (S, Msb:) [a translator:
(see the verb, above:)] pl. تَرَاجِمُ and تَرَاجِمَةٌ;
which latter favours the opinion of those who
hold the word to be of foreign origin. (S, Msb.)
The ت and م are [said to be] radicals; but J
makes the ت to be augmentative, and ترجمان
is mentioned in the T [as well as in the S] in art.
رجم, though the author of the T has mentioned
the verb among quadriliteral-radical words; and
there is a reason [for deriving it from رَجَمَ], for
one says لِسَانٌ يَرْجُمُ meaning “ a tongue that is
chaste, or perspicuous, and copious, in speech: ”
most, however, hold the ت to be a radical.
(Msb.) It is said in the K that the verb shows
the ت to be radical; whereas J and AHei and
IKt hold it to be augmentative; but there is a
difference of opinion whether it be from الرَّجْمُ
بِالحِجَارَةِ [the throwing stones], or from الرَّجْمُ
بِالغَيْبِ [the conjecturing, or speaking conjecturally]; and also whether it be Arabic, or arabicized from درغمان [a word which I do not know
in Persian nor in any other language]: (MF,
TA:) if arabicized, the present is its proper place.
(TA.)
مُتَرْجَمٌ [Interpreted: or translated. ―
-b2-  And also
The subject of a biography, or biographical notice.
―
-b3-  And] (assumed tropical:)  Confused, or dubious. (Har p. 537.)
