(Mgh;) the state of having matted and dusty
hair, or a dusty head, long left unanointed: (T,
Mgh, K:) so in relation to the rites and ceremonies of the pilgrimage: (T, K:) thus explained
by ISh; but not by any [other] of the lexicologists: he says that it is one of the rites and ceremonies of the pilgrimage; (T;) which is a conventional term of the professors, or lecturers,
of the colleges: (Mgh:) accord. to I'Ab, it
signifies the shaving, and shortening, or clipping,
of the beard and mustache and [the hair of] the
armpit, and slaughtering [of the victims], and
casting [of the pebbles]: accord. to Fr, the slaughtering of the [victims termed] بُدْن, and other
victims, namely, kine, and sheep or goats, and
shaving the head, and paring the nails, and the
like: (T:) AO says that no poem is adduced as presenting an ex. of it: (Msb, TA:) and Zj says that
it is not known by the lexicologists except from the
expositors of the Kur-án; (T, M;) who say that
it is the clipping the mustache, and paring the nails,
and plucking out the hair of the armpit, and
shaving the pubes, and clipping the hair [of the
head]: (T:) or the plucking out the hair, and
paring of the nails, and deviating from all that
is prohibited to the مُحْرِم: (M:) as though it
were a passing from the state of إِحْرَام to the state
of إِحْلَال: (T, M:) or, in the rites and ceremonies of the pilgrimage, the doing such things
as paring the nails, and clipping the mustache,
and shaving the pubes (S, K) and the head, and
casting the pebbles, and slaughtering the بُدْن,
(S,) &c.: (S, K: [but in two copies of the S,
this art. is omitted:]) or the doing away with
the matted and dusty state of the hair, and pollution and dirt, absolutely. (TA.) Accord. to ISh,
قَضَآءُ التَّفَثِ means The doing away with the
matted and dusty state of the hair by shaving,
and paring the nails, and the like: (T:) or it
means the doing away with the state of تَفَث, by

the pubes. (Mgh.) Accord. to IAar, ثُمَّ لِيَقْضُوا
تَفَثَهُمْ [in the Kur xxii. 30] means Then let them
accomplish their needful acts of shaving and
cleansing: (T:) or it means then let them do
away with their dirtiness, by clipping the mustache, and paring the nails, and plucking out the
hair of the armpit, and shaving the pubes, on the
occasion of إِحْلَال: (Bd:) it is an allowance,
after entering the state of إِحْلَال, of that which
was forbidden them in the state of إِحْرَام. (Msb.)
