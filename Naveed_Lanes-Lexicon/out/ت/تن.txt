تِنِّينٌ [in Hebr. 165] A great serpent; (K;)
a kind of serpent, (Lth, T, S, M,) one of the
greatest of serpents, (Lth, T,) or like the greatest
thereof: (M:) it is related that a company of
soldiers, on the shore of the Sea of Syria, saw
a cloud divide upon the sea, and then rise, and
they saw the tail of the تنّين in a state of commotion in the fringe of the cloud: it is also related
that a cloud carries the تنّين to the country of
Yájooj and Májooj [or Gog and Magog], and
casts it down there, and they assemble thereupon,
and eat its flesh: (T:) [these stories are fanciful
accounts of the natural phenomenon called a
water-spout, to which this name is applied by the
Arabs in the present day: but the word is generally understood to mean a dragon: and a great
sea-monster;] an aquatic animal, great in make,
terrible in appearance, long and broad in the
body, large in the head, having very glistening
eyes, wide mouth and inside, and many teeth:
it swallows many animals; the animals of the
land and of the sea fear it; and when it moves,
the sea becomes agitated with waves by reason of
its great strength: in its first state, it is a malignant serpent, that eats what it sees of the beasts
of the land; and when its mischief becomes great,
God sends an angel that carries it away, and
throws it to Yájooj and Májooj: it is related of
one that was seen to fall, that it was found to be
about two leagues in length, of a colour like that
of the leopard, with scales like those of a fish,
two great fins in form like those of a fish, a head
like a great hill, resembling the head of a man,
two long and great ears, and two round eyes;
and from its neck branched forth six other necks,
every one of them nearly twenty cubits long, and
every one of them having a head like that of the
serpent. (Kzw.) [Golius thinks it to mean The
shark (“carcharias”).] ―
-b2-  Hence, التِّنِّينُ is (assumed tropical:)  A
certain نَجْم [or constellation; the constellation
of the Dragon]; thus named as being likened
to the serpent so called; (M;) a constellation
containing thirty-one stars within the figure;
among which are those called الرَّاقِصُ and العَوَائِذُ
and الرُّبَعُ and الذِّئْبَانِ &c. (Kzw, TA. *) ―
-b3-  [Also,
app., (assumed tropical:)  A certain imaginary figure in the heavens,
extending along the line of the nodes of a planet,
which are called the dragon's head and the dragon's
tail, in Arabic الجَوْزَهَرُ (from the Persian گَوْزِهْرْ),
or الجَوْزَاهَرَانِ, and also العُقْدَتَانِ, and, to distinguish
each from the other, الرَّأْسُ وَالذَّنَبُ: this line
is supposed by Golius to be meant by the following description; but I incline to regard it as the
result of a confusion of a description of this line
with a description of the zodiacal light, a phenomenon supposed to have been unnoticed by the
Arabs:] a slight whiteness in the sky, (Lth, T,
K,) not an asterism, (Lth, T,) the body of which
is in six signs of the zodiac, and the tail, which
is slender, black, and twisted, in the seventh sign:
it changes place like the planets; is called in
Persian هَشْتَنْبَرْ, (Lth, T, K,) [app. a mistranscription of هَسْتَبُرْ,] in astrological computation; and
is inauspicious: (Lth, T:) accord. to J, a certain
place in the sky; which is a correct explanation, though said in the K to be a mistake.

-A2-  Also A wolf: (K, in this
art. and in art. تين:) but used only by El-Akhtal.
