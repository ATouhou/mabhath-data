sometimes also used for the ablution termed وُضُوْء:
(A, Mgh, TA:) so called from the same word
as signifying the act of “ running ” or “ flowing ”

gender: (T, A, K:) [or fem., for Z says,] I
passed, at the Gate of El-'Omrah, [of the Temple

تير;] A time; one time; [in the sense of the

(S:) pl. تَارَاتٌ (Lth, T, S, M, Msb, K) and تِيَرٌ;
(Lth, T, S, M, K;) the latter a contraction of
تِيَارٌ; like as they said قَامَاتٌ and قِيَمٌ, because of
the unsound letter. (S. [See also art. تأر.]) You
say, فَعَلَ ذٰلِكَ تَارَةً بَعْدَ تَارَةً He did that time after

Hassán,
لَتَسْمَعَنَّ وَشِيكًا فِى دِيَارِهِمُ
اَللّٰهُ أَكْبَرُ يَا تَارَاتِ عُثْمَانَ
[which probably means Thou wilt assuredly hear
speedily, in their abodes, “God is most great! O
the blood-revenge of 'Othmán! ” for ISd says,]
in my opinion, (M,) تارات is formed by transposition from وِتْرٌ signifying blood [or rather bloodrevenge], (M, K, *) though not agreeing with it
in measure: (M:) and وشيكا here means سَرِيعًا:
so says IB. (TA in art. وشك.) [See also ثَأْرٌ.]
