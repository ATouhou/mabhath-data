تلبQ. Q. 4
اِتْلَأَبَّ, (T, S, M, &c.,) inf. n. اِتْلِئْبَابٌ,
(S, K,) It (a thing, M, or an affair, or a case, S,
K, or a road, A) was, or became, uniform or
undeviating, (A,) right, or rightly directed or
ordered: (S, M, A, K:) or (M) it (a thing, M,
or a road, S, K) was, or became, extended, (Fr,
T, S, M, A, K,) and right, direct, even, or uniform: (S, M, K: *) or (M) it (a thing, M) was,
or became, set up, or erect. (M, A, K.) You say,
مَرُّوا فَانْلَأَبَّ بِهِمُ الطَّرِيقُ [They went along, and
the road was, or became, uniform, &c., with them;
i. e., their road was, or became, uniform, &c.].
(A.) And اتلأبّ أَمْرُهُمْ [Their affair, or case,
was, or became, right, or rightly directed or
ordered]. (A.) ―
-b2-  He (an ass) raised his breast
and head. (S, K.) ―
-b3-  This verb and its derivatives are mentioned in the [T and] S and K in
the present art.; but they are held by [ISd and]
IB to be radically quadriliteral. (TA.)
تَلْبٌ Loss; or the state of being lost; or perdition. (A, K.) One says, تَبًّا لَهُ تَلْبًا, (Lth, T,) or
تَبًّا لَهُ وَتَلْبًا [which may be rendered May God
decree loss and perdition to him]. (K.)
تُلَأْبِيبَةٌ a subst. (S, M, K) from اِتْلَأَبَّ; (Fr,
T, S, M, K;) [signifying The state of being uniform or undeviating, right, &c.;] like طُمَأْنِينَةٌ
[from اِطْمَأَنَّ]. (TA.)
تَوْلَبٌ, perfectly decl. [when used as a proper
name as well as when used as an appellative],
because it is of the measure فَوْعَلٌ; (Sb, S;) for
we judge its ت to be a radical, and its و to be
augmentative, because فَوْعَل is more common [as
the measure of a noun] than تَفْعَل; (M;) but
accord. to Suh, the ت is a substitute for و, and,
if so, it should be mentioned in art. ولب; (TA;)
A young ass; syn. جَحْشٌ: (S, K:) or the foal
of a wild ass, when he has completed a year.
(M.) And أُمُّ تَوْلَب is an appellation given to
The she-ass. (S.) ―
-b2-  The former is sometimes
metaphorically applied to (tropical:)  A [young] man: (M:)
or a boy. (S.)
مُتْلَئِبٌّ [Uniform or undeviating,] right, or
rightly directed or ordered [&c.: see the verb];
as also مُسْلَحِبٌّ. (Asudot;, T) Also applied to a rule,
(A, TA,) as meaning Uniform, undeviating, or
of general application; uniformly, or constantly,
obtaining. (TA.)
مَتَالِبُ [app. pl. of مَتْلَبٌ or مَتْلِبٌ] The places
where a wound causes death; syn. مَقَاتِلُ. (IAar,
T.)
Quasi تلج
أَتْلَجَ: and تَوْلَجٌ: see art. ولج.
