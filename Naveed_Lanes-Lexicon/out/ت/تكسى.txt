كِسَآءٌ
[A garment]. See عَبَآءٌ, and حِلْسٌ and

-b2-  ذُو كِسَآءٍ, as opposed to ذُوبُرْدٍ, (assumed tropical:)  A
poor man. (S, art. عج.) [The كساء was
evidently a simple oblong piece of cloth; for
الكِسَائِى is said to have been thus named because
he wore a كساء while in the state of إِحْرَام; as
is mentioned in the TA, art. كسو; but it seems
to have been sometimes sewed in the manner of
the عَبَآء, which see; and see also مُسَيَّحٌ, and بُرْدٌ.]
It is [properly] not one of the garments which
are cut and sewed [but is a single piece]: (Mgh,
art. قطع:) [a wrapper, or wrapping garment,
of a single piece]. ―
-b3-  رَكِبَ كِسَآءَهُ
He fell upon
the back of his neck. (IAar, in TA, art. ردع.)
