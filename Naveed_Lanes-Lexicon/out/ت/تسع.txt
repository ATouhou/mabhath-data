تسع1
تَسَعَهُمْ, aor.
تَسَعَ (S, Msb, K) and
تَسِعَ (Yoo, Msb,
K) and
تَسُعَ, (Msb,) inf. n. تَسْعٌ, (T K,) He took
the ninth part of their possessions: or he became
the ninth of them: (S, Msb, K:) or he made
them to be nine with himself; (K;) they having
before been eight. (TA.) [See also 2.]
2
تسّعهُ He made it nine. (Esh-Sheybánee,
and K voce وَحَّدَ.) [See also 1.] ―
-b2-  تسّع لِامْرَأَتِهِ,
or عِنْدَهَا, He remained nine nights with his wife:
and in like manner the verb is used in relation to
any saying or action. (TA voce سَبَّعَ.)
4
اتسعوا They became nine: (S, K:) and they
became ninety. (M and L in art. ثلث.) ―
-b2-  They
were, or became, persons whose camels came to
water [on the ninth day, counting the day of the
next preceding watering as the first; i. e.,] after
an interval of nine days, [of which the first or
last, or each of these, was not complete,] and eight
nights. (S, * K, * TA.)
تَسْعٌ: see تِسْعَةٌ.
تُسْعٌ A ninth part; one of nine parts; (S,
Msb, K,) as also ↓ تُسُعٌ; (Msb;) and ↓ تَسِيعٌ, (S,
Msb, K,) agreeably with a rule which some hold
to be applicable in the case of every similar fractional number; but Sh says, I have not heard
تَسِيعٌ on any authority but that of AZ. (TA.)
تِسْعٌ fem. of تِسْعَةٌ, q. v. ―
-b2-  Also A certain ظْمء
of the أَظْمَآء of camels; (S, K, TA;) i. e., their
coming to water [on the ninth day, counting the
day of the next preceding watering as the first;
or, in other words,] after an interval of nine days,
[of which the first or last, or each of these, is not
complete,] and eight nights. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Also The
ninth young one, or offspring. (A in art. ثلث.)
تُسَعٌ The seventh and eighth and ninth nights
of the [lunar] month; (K;) the three nights of
the month which are after the نُفَل, because the
last night of these is the ninth; (S;) among the
nights of the month are three called غُرَرٌ, [pl. of
غُرَّةٌ,] and after these are three called نُفَلٌ, and
after these are three called تُسَعٌ because the last of
them is the ninth night: (Az, TA:) or the three
nights of the commencement of the month, as some
say; but the first of these explanations is more
agreeable with analogy. (TA.)
تُسُعٌ: see تُسْعٌ.
تِسْعَةٌ, applied to denote a number, [namely
Nine,] is masc. ; and ↓ تِسْعٌ, so applied, is fem.:
(S:) the latter is also written ↓ تَسْعٌ, with fet-h to
the ت; and is thus pronounced in the Kur
xxxviii. 22, (Bd, MF,) accord. to one reading.
(Bd.) You say تِسْعَةُ رِجَالٍ [Nine men], and تِسْعٌ
نِسْوَةٍ [Nine women]. (K.) When it means the
things numbered, not the amount of the number,
تسعة is imperf. decl., being regarded as a proper
name: thus you say, تِسْعَةُ أَكْثَرُ مِنْ ثَمَانِيَةَ [Nine
things are more than eight things]. (TA.) It is
said in the Kur [xvii. 103], وَ لَقَدْ آتَيْنَا مُوسَى تِسْعَ آيَاتٍ
بَيِّنَاتٍ [And we formerly gave unto Moses nine evident signs; generally understood to mean the principal miracles which he was empowered to perform,
and which are differently enumerated in the K
and other works; but by some supposed to mean
statutes]. (K, * TA.) ―
-b2-  In تِسْعَةَ عَشَرَ, which is
masc., and تِسْعَ عَشْرَةَ, which is fem., [each signifying Nineteen,] each of the two words ends with
fet-h in every case, because they are two nouns
which are regarded as one noun. (TA.) The
former is pronounced by some of the Arabs تِسْعَةَ
عْشَرَ: and the latter, thus in the dial. of El-Hijáz
[and of most of the Arabs], is pronounced تِسْعَ
عَشِرَةَ in the dial. of Nejd. (S in art. عشر.) In
the Kur lxxiv. 30, some read, تِسْعَةَ عْشَرَ, making
the ع in عشر quiescent, instead of تِسْعَهَ عَشَرَ, from
a dislike of this consecution of vowels in what is
like one word. (Bd, TA. *)
[
تِسْعُونَ, Ninety: and ninetieth.]
[
تُسَاعَ, as meaning Nine and nine, or nine and
nine together, or nine at a time and nine at a
time, seems not to have been in use.] A'Obeyd
says that more than أُحَادَ and ثُنَآءَ and ثُلَاثَ and
رُبَاعَ has not been heard, except عُشَارَ occurring in
a verse of El-Kumeyt. (TA in art. عشر.)
تَسِيعٌ: see تُسْعٌ.
تَاسِعٌ [Making to be nine with himself, or itself:
and hence, ninth]. You say, هُوَ تَاسِعُ تِسْعَةٍ [He
is the ninth of nine]: and تَاسِعُ ثَمَانِيَةٍ [He is
making eight to be nine with himself]: but it is
not allowable to say, تَاسِعٌ تِسْعَةً. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [تَاسِعَ
عَشَرَ and تَاسِعَةَ عَشْرَةَ, the former masc. and the
latter fem., meaning Nineteenth, are subject to
the same rules as ثَالِثَ عَشَرَ and its fem., explained
in art. ثلث, q. v.]
تَاسُوعَآءُ, (Msb, TA, &c.,) or التَّاسُوعَآءُ, (S, K,)
The tenth day of [the month] El-Moharram;
(Msb, TA;) [the day] before the day of العَاشُورَآءُ,
(S,) or before the day of عَاشُورَآءُ: (K:) or,
accord. to some, the same as the day of العاشوراء:
(TA:) [see عاشوراء, where this is explained:] it
is a post-classical word: (Sgh, K:) J says, in the
S, I think it post-classical: (Msb, TA:) but [SM
says,] this requires consideration; for it was used
by the Prophet: (TA:) one ought to say, that,
with عاشوراء, it has this form for the sake of
resemblance; but as used alone, it must be conceded that it has not been heard [from the Arabs
of the classical times]. (Msb.)
[
مُتَسَّعٌ pass. part. n. of 2, q. v. See also مُثَلَّثٌ.]
مَتْسُوعٌ A rope consisting of nine strands. (TA.)
