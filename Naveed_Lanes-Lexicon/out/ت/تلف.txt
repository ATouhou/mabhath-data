-b2-  El-Farezdak says,
وَقَوْمٍ كِرَامٍ قَدْ نَقَلْنَا إِلَيْهِمُ
قِرَاهُمْ فَأَتْلَفْنَا المَنَايَا وَأَتْلَفُوا
(so in the T and L,) or
وَأَضْيَافِ لَيْلٍ قَدْ نَقَلْنَا قِرَاهُمُ
إِلَيْهِمْ وَأَتْلَفْنَا المَنَايَا وَأَتْلَفُوا
(so in some copies of the K,) or قَدْ بَلَغْنَا قِرَاهُمُ,
(so in other copies of the K and in the TA,) or
قد فَعَلْنَا قراهم, (so in the O,) i. e., [accord. to the
different readings, How many a generous company of men has there been, or how many guests
of the night have there been, to whom we have
brought their entertainment, and] we have found
the fates to be destructive, (T, K, *) and they have
found them to be so: (T:) it is like the phrase
أَتَيْنَا فُلَانًا فَأَبْخَلْنَاهُ and أَجْبَنَّاهُ: (TA:) or we found
the fates to destroy us, and they found them to
destroy them: or we made the fates to be destruction to them, and they made them to be destruction
to us: (ISk, K:) he means, we engaged with
them in vehement fight, and slew them. (TA.)

to pestilence, or epidemic disease, there results
death, or perdition. (T.) And in a prov., السَّلَفُ
تَلَفٌ [The paying for a thing beforehand is a
cause of perishing to one's property]. (TA.)
And one says, ذَهَبَتْ نَفْسُهُ تَلَفًا and طَلَفًا, (S, K,)
both meaning the same, (S,) His blood went for
nothing, or as a thing of no account, unretaliated,
and uncompensated by a mulct. (S, K.)
