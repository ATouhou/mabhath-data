توتتُوتٌ (ISk, T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K) and تُوثٌ;
(Mgh, and L and K in art. توث, q. v.;) the latter
sometimes used; (Msb;) or this is not allowable;
(ISk, T, S, Msb;) for the word, which is app.
Persian, is pronounced by the Arabs with ت for
the final as well as for the initial letter; (T, Msb;)
[The mulberry; and especially the white mulberry;] i. q. فِرْصَادٌ: (ISk, T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K:)
or, accord. to the people of El-Basrah, (Msb,) or
some of the people of El-Basrah, (Mgh,) توت is
the name of the fruit, and فرصاد is that of the
tree; (Mgh, Msb;) and this is what is commonly
held: (Msb:) or, accord. to IDrd and others,
توت is an arabicized word, and فرصاد is the
Arabic name: (TA:) [توت is a coll. gen. n.:]
the n. un. is with ة. (M.) [Golius says, in his
Lex., on the authority of Zeyn El-' Attár, that
there are three kinds: “ توت حلو,” i. e. حُلْوٌ,
“ the sweet and white mulberry, peculiarly called
فرصاد; and توت حامض,” i. e. حَامِضٌ, ““ the sour
and black mulberry; and توت وحشى,” i. e.
وَحْشِىٌّ, “and توت العليق,” i. e. العُلَّيْقٌ, “the wild
mulberry, i. e., with red fruit. ” In Egypt, توت
is applied to the sweet mulberry, white and black,
and especially to the former, as also توت بَلَدِىّ;
and توت شَامِىّ to the latter. In the present day,
توت العُلَّيْق is applied to the raspberry; as also
توت شَوْكِىّ: and توت وَحْشِىّ, I believe, to the
blackberry. توت أَرْضِىّ and توت إِفْرَنْجِىّ are
applied to the strawberry.]
تُوتِيَآءٌ, [of the masc. gender, as is shown by the
phrase توتياء مَعْدَنِىٌّ, and therefore perfectly decl.,]
an arabicized word, (S, Msb,) [Tutia, or tutty;
an impure protoxide of zinc;] a certain stone [or
mineral], (S, K,) well known, (M, K,) employed
as a collyrium. (S, Msb.) [It is also applied in
the present day to several kinds of vitriol; the
sulphates of zinc and of copper and of iron. De
Sacy says, on the authority of Ibn-Beytár, that
there are two species thereof; one which is found
in mines; the other, in the furnaces in which
copper is melted, like cadmia; and this latter
species is what the Greeks call pompholyx: of
the fossil tutia there are three varieties; one is
white; another, greenish; the third, yellow, with
a strong tinge of red: the white is the finest
variety; the green, the coarsest. (Chrest. Arabe,
2nd ed., iii. 453; where see more.) Golius, on
this word, in his Lex., says, “Optima est quæ vel
naturalis, sc. Indica, cærulea, et pellucida; vel
artificialis, sc. Carmanica, alba cum partis viridioris strictura. Zein. ” i. e. Zeyn El-' Attár. “ Ex
plumbi præstantissimi, quod dicitur قلعى, fuligine
concrescere præstantissimum genus, commune vero
ex fuligine æris, tradit Jacutus ex Abulfed. ”.]
