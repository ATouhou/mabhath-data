تتوّج He was, or became, crowned, or invested with the crown. (S, A, K.) [For the verb
تَاجَ, in this or a similar sense, mentioned in the
Lexicons of Golius and Freytag, in the former as
from the K, I find no authority: on the contrary,
it is said in the TA that no verb answering to
تَائِجٌ has been heard.] ―
-b2-  He was made, or became,
a prince, lord, or chief. (TA.) ―
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  He was, or
became, turbaned, or invested with the turban.
(TA.)
تَاجٌ A crown; (S, A, K, TA;) i. e. a thing
that is made for kings, of gold and jewels; (TA;)
peculiar to the عَجَم [or Persians and other
foreigners]: (Msb:) [a Persian word:] pl. [of
mult.] تِيجَانٌ (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K) and [of pauc.]
أَتْوَاجٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  A turban; as being likened
to a crown. (TA.) It is said in a trad., (TA,)
العَمَائِمُ تِيجَانُ العَرَبِ [Turbans are the crowns of
the Arabs]; (S, TA;) i. e. turbans are to the
Arabs as crowns to the kings; for the Arabs in
the deserts are [or were] mostly bare-headed or
wearing قَلَانِس [pl. of قَلَنْسُوَةٌ, q. v.]; turbans
among them being few. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Also Silver.
(TA.) [See what next follows.]
تَاجَةٌ An ingot of purified silver: originally
تَازَهْ, a Persian word, applied to a dirhem recently
coined. (TA.)
تَائِجٌ Having a تَاج [i. e. crown, or (assumed tropical:)  turban];
an epithet applied to an إِمَام: (K:) it is a possessive epithet, like دَارِعٌ, for we have not heard
any verb answering to it. (TA.)
مُتَوَّجٌ Crowned; applied to a king: (A, TA:)
(assumed tropical:)  made a prince, lord, or chief: (assumed tropical:)  turbaned. (TA.)
مَتَاوِجُ [a pl. of which the sing. is not mentioned,] occurring in the saying of Jendel Er-Rá'ee,
وَهُنَّ يَعْمِينَ مِنَ المَلَامِجِ
بِقَرِدٍ مُخْرَنْطِمِ المَتَاوِجِ
signifies [properly The parts of the head] where
one is crowned (حَيْثُ يُتَتَوَّجُ) with the turban:
(K,* TA:) [but it is evidently here used in a
tropical manner; the poet is speaking of she-camels:] the ملامج are the mouths; [or the parts
around the mouths;] and the قَرِد, a word like
كَتِف, is the accumulated foam which the camel
casts forth from his mouth. (TA.) [It seems
that the poet means, And they cast forth, from
the parts around the mouth, accumulated foam,
elongated in the extremities: مُخْرَنْطِم being app.
syn. with مُخَرْطَم, as meaning “ elongated like
a خُرْطُوم,” or “ snout. ”]
