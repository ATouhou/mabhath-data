اتقنهُ, (K,) inf. n. إِتْقَانٌ, (JK, S,) i. q. أَحْكَمَهُ
[He made it, or rendered it, (namely, a thing,
JK, or an affair, S and K,) firm, stable, strong,
solid, compact, sound, or free from defect or imperfection, by the exercise of skill; he made it
firmly, strongly, solidly, compactly, so that it
was firmly and closely joined or knit together,
soundly, thoroughly, skilfully, judiciously, or well;
he so constructed, constituted, established, settled,
arranged, did, performed, or executed, it; he put
it into a firm, solid, sound, or good, state, or on a
firm, solid, sound, or good, footing]. (JK, S,
K.) [And اتقن لَهُ signifies the same as اتقنهُ: or
he exercised, or possessed, the skill requisite for it;
namely, an affair.] الَّذِي أَتْقَنَ كُلَّ شَّىْءٍ, in the
Kur xxvii. 90, means Who hath created everything firmly, strongly, solidly, &c., (أَحْكَمَ خَلْقَهُ,)
and made it, fashioned it, or disposed it, in the
fit, proper, or right, manner. (Bd.) [You say
also, اتقن عِلْمَهُ, meaning He made his knowledge
sound; or made himself thoroughly learned.] And
اتقن عَنْهُ He knew it, or learned it, (namely, a
tradition [&c.],) soundly, thoroughly, or well,
from him. (TA in art. ذبر.)
تِقْنٌ The رُسَابَة of water, (JK, Mgh, K,) in a
rivulet or in the channel of a torrent, (K,) in the
[season called] رَبِيع; (Lth, JK, Mgh;) i. e.,
(Mgh,) [its sediment, or] the thick matter that
is borne by it [and that sinks to the bottom; used
for improving land]: (Lth, JK, Mgh:) and (K)
the تُرْنُوق of a well (Mgh, K) and of the channel
of a torrent; i. e., the slime, mixed with black,
or black and fetid, mud; accord. to the Jámi' of
El-Ghooree. (Mgh.) ―
-b2-  A thing by means of
which one subsists, and makes good, or improves,
the performance, or execution, or management, of
an affair; as iron, and other things, of the جَوَاهِر
[i. e. precious stones, or native ores,] of the earth:
and anything by means of which a thing is made
good, or improved, is called its تِقْن. (TA.) ―
-b3-
A skilful man: (JK, S, K:) pl. أَتْقَانٌ. (TA.) ―
-b4-
[Hence, probably,] تِقْنٌ [or اِبْنُ تِقْنٍ] is also the
name [or surname] of a certain man proverbial
for his excellence in shooting. (S, K. [In the
latter it is implied that this name or surname is
التِّقْنُ.]) The rájiz says,
يَرَمِى بِهَا أَرْمَى مِنِ ابْنِ تِقْنِ
[One more skilled in shooting than Ibn-Tikn
shoots it]. (S.) ―
-b5-  Nature, or natural disposition.
(JK, S, K.) You say, الفَصَاحَةُ مِنْ تِقْنِهِ Chasteness of speech, or eloquence, is [a quality] of his

Quasi تقى: or, accord. to some, تقو

تَقَى, aor.
1َ2ِ3َ (T, S, K, in art. وقى) and
1َ2َ3َ,
(T, TA,) or تَقِىَ, aor.
1َ2َ3َ, (Msb, [but the correctness of this I greatly doubt, unless, as appears to
be the case, it is meant to be understood as an
intrans. verb,]) inf. n. تَقْىٌ, (S and TA in art.
تقى, [which art. I find in only one copy of the
S,]) or تُقًى, (K,) or تُقَاةٌ, (Msb, and also mentioned in the TA,) of which تُقًى is pl., or coll. n.,
(Kzz, IB, Msb,) and تَقِيَّةٌ (K) and تِقَآءٌ; (Lh,
K;) and ↓ اِتَقَّى, (T, S, Msb, K,) inf. n. اِتِّقَآءٌ
(Msb) and [quasi-inf. n.] تَقِيَّةٌ and تُقَاةٌ; (S, art.
وقى;) He feared God: (S and TA in art. تقى:
all else that follows is from art. وقى except where
reference is made to another art.:) or he was
cautious of a thing; guarded, or was on his
guard, against it; prepared, prepared himself,
or was in a state of preparation, against it; or
feared it: (K:) or he looked forward to a thing,
and guarded against it, sought to avoid it, or
was cautious of it. (T, TA.) [For other explanations of the latter verb, which apply also to the
former, see art. وقى.] ↓ اِتَّقَى is originally اِوْتَقَى;
(T, S;) then اِيتَقَى; then اِتَّقَى; and when this
came to be much in use, they imagined the ت
to be a radical part of the word, and made the
word اِتَقَى, aor. يَتَقِى, with fet-h to the ت in each
case, and without teshdeed; and not finding any
analogue to it in their language, they said تَقَى,
aor. يَتْقِى, like قَضَى, aor. يَقْضِى: (S:) or, as is
said in the T, they suppressed the ت, and the اِتَّقَى
changed into ت, in اِتَّقَى, and said تَقَى, aor.
يَتْقِى. (TA.) A poet says, (namely, Khufáf Ibn-Nudbeh, TA,)
جَلَاهَا الصَّيْقَلُونَ فَأَخْلَصُوهَا
خِفَافًا كُلُّهَا يَتْقِى بِأَثْرِ
or, as some read it, يَتَقِى, with the ت movent,
but without teshdeed; (S;) and this latter, accord.
to IB, is the right reading. (TA.) [See this verse
explained in art. اثر.] IB adds that Aboo-Sa'eed
[app. meaning As] disallowed تَقَى, aor. يَتْقِى,
inf. n. تَقْىٌ; saying that it would require the imperative to be اِتْقِ, which is not said; and this,
he states, is right: [for] J says that the imperative used is تَقِ [Fear thou, or beware thou, &c.],
as in تَقِ اللّٰهِ [Fear thou God]; and to a woman,
تَقِى; formed from the verb اِتَقَى, without tesh-deed, by the suppression of the ا. (TA.)
4
مَا اَتْقَاهُ لِلّٰهِ (S, TA) How great is his reverential, or pious, fear of God! (TA.) ―
-b2-  ما اتقاهُ is
also said of a saddle, as meaning How good is it
for not galling the back! (TA.)

إِ1ْتَ2َ3َ see 1, in two places; and see also art. وقى.
تُقًى: see تَقْوَى.
تُقَاةٌ: see تَقْوَى, in two places. ―
-b2-  In the phrase
in the Kur [iii. 27], إِلَّا أَنْ تَتَّقُوا مِنْهُمْ تُقَاةً, it may
be an inf. n. [so that the meaning may be Unless
ye fear from them with a great fearing (see 1)]:
or it may be a pl. [app. of تَقِىٌّ, like as كُمَاةٌ is
pl. of كَمِىٌّ, so that the meaning may be unless
ye fear from them, being fearful]: but it is better
to regard it as an inf. n. because another reading
is تَقِيَّةً. (M, TA.)
تَقِىٌّ, applied to a man, (Msb, K, TA,) i. q.
وَقِىٌّ (TA) and مُتَّقٍ (S) [Fearing; cautious; &c.:
(see 1:) and particularly having a reverential, or
pious, fear of God: or simply pious: or one who
preserves, or guards, himself, accord. to some,
exceedingly, or extraordinarily, from sin, either of
commission or of omission: (see 8 in art. وقى:)]
accord. to IDrd, one who preserves, or guards,
himself from punishment [in the world to come],
and from acts of disobedience, by righteous conduct: from وَقَيْتُ نَفْسِى: said by the grammarians
to be originally وَقُوىٌ; then, تَقُوىٌ: or, accord.
to Aboo-Bekr, [originally] of the measure فَعِيلٌ,
as is indicated by the first of its pls. mentioned
below: but he who says that it is [originally] of
the measure فَعُولٌ says that it has that pl. because
it has become like a word [originally] of the
measure فَعِيلٌ: (TA:) or righteous, virtuous,
just, or honest; (Msb in art. تقى;) contr. of
فَاجِرٌ: (idem in art. بر:) pl. أَتْقِيَآءُ (Msb in art.
تقى, and K) and تُقَوَآءُ, (K,) which is extr., and
of a class disallowed by Sb, (TA,) [and app. also
تُقَاةٌ, q. v. suprà.]
تَقِيَّةٌ: see what next follows.
تَقْوَى, or تَقْوًى, accord. to different readings in
the Kur ix. 110, (Bd,) [of which readings the
former is the more common,] is originally تَقْيَا,
(K,) [or تَقْيًا,] or [rather وَقْيَا, or وَقْيًا, and then]
وَقْوَى, of the measure فَعْلَى, from وَقَيْتُ, (ISd,
TA,) or, accord. to MF, the right opinion is that
it is [وَقْوًى,] of the measure فَعْوَلٌ, (TA,) and is
thus transformed in order to make a distinction
between the subst. and the epithet such as خَزْيَا
and صَدْيَا: (K:) it is a subst. from اِتَّقَى or وَقَى;
(Msb, K;) [and signifies Fear; caution; &c.:
(see 1:) and particularly reverential, or pious,
fear of God: or simply piety: or the preservation, or guarding, of oneself, accord. to some,
exceedingly, or extraordinarily, from sin, either
of commission or of omission: or the preservation,
or guarding, of oneself from punishment in the
world to come, and from acts of disobedience, by
righteous conduct: or righteousness, virtue, justice,
or honesty: (see تَقِىٌّ:) its explanations in relation
to religion are many and various, but are all resolvable into fear of God, or of sin; or the preservation, or guarding, of oneself from sin:] and
↓ تَقِيَّةٌ and ↓ تُقَاةٌ are syn. with each other (S) and
with تَقْوَي, (Msb,) and are used as inf. ns. of
اِتَّقَى: (S:) and ↓ تُقًى [also] is syn. with تَقْوَي;
(S;) or it is pl. of ↓ تُقَاةٌ, or a coll. n., (Kzz, IB,
Msb,) like as طُلًى is of طُلَاةٌ, (Kzz, IB,) and
as رُطَبٌ is of رُطَبَةٌ. (Msb.) وَآتَاهُمْ تَقْوَاهُمْ, in
the Kur xlvii. 19, means And hath explained to
them, (Bd,) or suggested to them, (Jel, TA,) what
they should fear, or that from which they should
preserve themselves: (Bd, Jel, TA:) or hath aided
them to practise their تَقْوَى: (Bd:) or hath given
them the recompense of their تقوى. (Bd, TA.)
And هُوَ أَهْلُ التَّقْوَى, in the Kur lxxiv. last verse,
means He is entitled, or worthy, to be feared;
or to be reverentially, or piously, feared. (Bd,
Jel, K.)
هُوَ أَتْقَى مِنْ فُلَانٍ [He is more fearing, or
cautious, &c., than such a one; more reverentially, or piously, fearful of God; or more pious;
&c.;] he has more تَقْوَى than such a one. (TA.)
