earth. (M, K, TA.) ―

as though he clave to the dust, or earth: (S,
Msb:) and he suffered loss, and became poor,
(M, K,) so that he clave to the dust, or earth;
(M;) inf. n. as above, (M, K,) and مَتْرَبَةٌ, (M,)
or مَتْرَبٌ, (K,) or both of these: (TA:) his wealth
became little; (A;) as also ↓ اترب, (M, A, K,)
and ↓ ترّب: (K:) or ↓ اترب signifies, (T, S, M,)
or signifies also, (A, K,) and so تَرِبَ, (A,) and
↓ ترّب, (K,) his wealth became much, or abundant,
(T, M, A, K,) so that it was like the dust, or
earth; which is the more known meaning of the
verb; (M;) or he became rich; (S, Msb;) as
though he became possessed of wealth equal in
quantity to the dust, or earth: (S, A:) accord. to
Abu-l-'Abbás, ↓ تَتْرِيبٌ signifies [the having]
much wealth; and also [the having] little wealth.
(T.) You say, ↓ تَرِبَ بَعْدَ مَا أَتْرَبَ , meaning He
became poor after he had been rich. (A.) ―
-b4-
تَرِبَتْ يَدَاكَ, (T, S, A, Msb, in the M and K يَدَاهُ,)
a form of imprecation, (S, Msb,) meaning [May
thine arms, or thy hands, cleave to the dust, or
earth, by reason of poverty; as is implied in the
T: or] may thy hands have in them dust, or
earth: (Ham p. 275:) or mayest thou not obtain,
or attain, good: (S, K: *) or mayest thou be unsuccessful, or fail of attaining thy desire, and
suffer loss: (A:) occurring in a trad., and as
some relate, (A'Obeyd, T,) not meant as an imprecation; (A'Obeyd, T, Msb;) being a phrase
current with the Arabs, who use it without
desiring its fulfilment; (A'Obeyd, T;) but meant
to incite, or instigate: (Msb:) some say that it
means may thy hands become rich; but this is a
mistake: (A'Obeyd, T:) and it is said to mean
لِلّٰهِ دَرُّكَ [which see in art. در]: and some say that
it is literally an imprecation: but the first assertion is the most worthy of respect, (that it is not
meant as an imprecation,) and is corroborated by
the saying, in a trad., اِنْعِمْ صَبَاحًا تَرِبَتْ يَدَاكَ
[Mayest thou have a pleasant morning: may thine
arms, or thy hands, &c.]. (TA.) تَرِبَتْ جَبِينُهُ
[May his forehead (for so جبين here means, as
it does in some other instances,) cleave to the
dust, or earth,] was said by Mohammad in reproving a man, and is said to mean a prayer that
the man might be frequent in prostrating himself
in prayer. (TA from a trad.) And he said to
one of his companions, تَرِبَتْ نَحْرُكَ [May the
uppermost part of thy breast cleave to the dust,
or earth], and the man was [afterwards] slain a
martyr: therefore this is to be understood in
its obvious sense. (TA.)

speaking of anything that is improved, or put into
a right or proper state [by means of dust or earth];
and ↓ the latter of them, in speaking of anything
that is injured or marred or spoiled [thereby]:
you say, الإِهَابَ ↓ تَرَبَتِ [She sprinkled, or put,
dust, or earth, upon the hide], to prepare it
properly for use; and so of a skin for water or
milk. (TA.) It is said in a trad., [accord. to one
reading,] اتْرِبُوا الكِتَابَ [Sprinkle ye the writing

36], means [Showing love to their husbands;] like,
or equal, unto them, or resembling them: which
is a good rendering, as there is no begetting or
bearing of children, [or rather as the latter word
does not apply to females born or generated,] in
that case. (TA.)
تَرِبٌ, applied to a place, (M, TA,) and to soil,
(TA,) Abounding with dust; dusty: (T, M,

reason of want; having nothing between him and
the earth: (IAar, T:) [cleaving to the dust by

or, as some say, a certain thorny tree, of which
the fruit is like a suspended unripe date, growing

ground, and in Tihámeh: accord. to AHn, the
تَرِبَة is a green herb, or leguminous plant, that has
a purging effect upon camels: (M:) [accord. to

by the change of د into ت: accord. to Lh, a
[camel such as is termed] بَكْر that is trained, or
rendered submissive or tractable; and in like
manner a she-camel, one that will follow a person
if he takes hold of her lip or her eyelash: and
As, who derives it from تٌرَابٌ, says that this
epithet is applied to land, or ground, and any

and ↓ تَيْرَابٌ and ↓ تَيْرَبٌ [and ↓ تَيرَبٌ as will be seen
below] and ↓ تَرِيبٌ (S, M, K) and ↓ تِرْيَبٌ, (M, K)
accord. to MF ↓ تَرْيَبٌ, which is perhaps a dial.
var., and accord. to some ↓ تِرْيِبٌ, and ↓ تَرْيَابٌ,
(TA,) signify the same, (Lth, T, S, M, A, K,)
and are words of which the meaning is well
known: (A, K:) [i. e. Dust: and earth: generally the former; i. e. fine, dry, particles of earth;
as when we say, الرِّيحُ تَسُوقُ التُّرَابَ The wind
drives along the dust: but we also use the expression تُرَابٌ نَدٍ, meaning moist earth, the explanation, in Lexicons, of the word ثَرًى:] ?ثَرًى is تُرَابٌ;
and when it ceases to be moist, it is still تراب, but
is not then called ثرى: (Msb voce ثرى:) accord.
to Fr, تُرَابٌ is a gen. n., from which is formed
neither dual nor pl.: and its rel. n. is ↓ تُرَابِىٌّ:
(TA:) [but when it means a kind of dust or
earth, as ↓ تُرْبَةٌ also does sometimes, it has a pl.:
in this case,] accord. to Lh, (M,) its pl. is أَتْرِبَةٌ
[a pl. of pauc.] and تِرْبَانٌ [a pl. of mult.]; (S, M,
K) and some add تُرْبَانٌ: (TA:) [and when ↓ تُرْبَةٌ
has this, or a similar, meaning, it has for its pl.
تُرَبٌ; as in the phrase أَطْيَبُ التُّرَبِ the best of the
kinds of earth, occurring in this art. in the A:]
but no pl. of any of the other syn. words mentioned above has been heard: (M, K:) AAF
says that تراب is the pl. of ترب; [app. meaning
that تُرَابٌ is a quasi-pl. n. (which is often called
in lexicons a pl.) of تُرْبٌ;] but MF observes that
this requires consideration: (TA:) Lth says that
↓ تُرْبٌ and تُرَابٌ are syn.; but when the fem. forms
of these words are used, they say, ↓ أَرْضٌ طَيّبَةُ التُّرْبَة
meaning Land that is good in respect of the
natural constitution of its dust or earth; and
↓ تُرَابَةٌ when meaning A layer, or lamina, of dust
or earth, such as is not perceived by the sight, but
only by the imagination: (T:) or this last word
and ↓ تُرْبَةٌ signify a portion of dust or earth:
and الأَرْضِ ↓ تُرْبَةُ signifies the exterior, or external
part, of the earth: (M:) and ↓ التَّرْبَآءُ, the earth
(S, K) itself. (S.) The Arabs said, التُّرَابُ لَكَ
[Dust, or earth, be thy lot]; using the nom. case,
although meaning an imprecation, because the
word is a simple subst., not an inf. n.: but Lh
mentions the phrase التُّرَابَ لِلْأَبْعَدِ [Dust, or earth,
be the lot of the remote from good]; saying that
the accus. case is used, as though the phrase were
an imprecation [of the ordinary kind, in which an
inf. n. is used in the accus. case as the absolute
complement of its own verb understood]. (M.)
And لَهُ التُّرَابُ is a phrase used as meaning (assumed tropical:)  [He
has, or shall have, or may he have,] disappointment, (Msb in art. عهر,) or, nothing. (A 'Obeyd,
Mgh in art. فرش.) لَهُ وَجَنْدَلًا ↓ تُرْبًا is also a form
of imprecation, in which substs. in the proper
sense of the term are used in the manner of inf. ns.,
put in the accus. case by reason of a verb unexpressed; as though it were for تَرِبَتْ يَدَاهُ وَجُنْدِلَتْ
[May his arms, or his hands, cleave to the dust,
or earth, and the stones, by reason of poverty]:
and some of the Arabs put the nouns in the nom.
case, still using the phrase in the same sense, as
though they were in the accus. (M.) One says
also, ↓ بِفِيهِ التَّوْرَبُ and ↓ التَّيْرَبُ and ↓ التِّيِرَبُ and
↓ التَّرْبَآءُ and ↓ التَّوْرَابُ [In his mouth is dust, or
earth: or may dust, or earth, be in his mouth;
i. e. may he die, or be in his grave]. (T.) It is
said in a trad. that God created the ↓ تُرْبَة [meaning the dust, or soil, or, accord. to the TA the
earth (أَرْض),] on the seventh day of the week;
and created upon it the mountains on the first
day; and the trees, on the second day. (T.) And
one says, ↓ لَأَضْرِبَنَّهُ حَتَّى يَعَضَّ بِالتَّرْبَآءِ, (Lth, T, A,)
meaning [I will assuredly beat him so that he
shall bite] the dust, or earth. (Lth, T.) And
↓ بَيْنَهُمَا مَا بَيْنَ الجَرْبَآءِ وَالتَّرْبَآءِ, meaning [Between
them two is the space that is between] the heaven
and the earth. (A.)

تَرِيبَةٌ, (S, M, TA,) or ↓ تَرِيبٌ, (TA,) sing. of
تَرَائِبُ, (S, M, TA,) which signifies The part of
the breast which is the place of the collar, or necklace: (T, M, K:) so by the common consent of
the lexicologists: (T:) or the bones of the breast:
(M, A, K:) or the bones of the breast that are
between the collar-bone and the pap: (S:) or the
part of the breast, or chest, that is next to the
two collar-bones: or the part that is between the
two breasts and the collar-bones: or four ribs of
the right side of the chest and four of the left
thereof: (M, K:) or the two arms and two legs
and two eyes: (T, M, K:) it is also said that the
تَرِيبَتَانِ are the two ribs that are next to the two
collar-bones: IAth says that the تَرِيبَة is the uppermost part of the human breast, beneath the chin;
and its pl. is as above: accord. to IF, in the Mj,
the ↓ تريب is the breast, or chest: MF says that
ترائب relates to males and females in common;
but most of the authors on strange words affirm
decidedly that it is peculiar to women: (TA:)
the تَرِيبَة of the camel is the part in which it is
stabbed, or stuck; syn. مَنْحَر. (M.)

mistranscription: if not, it must be ↓ أَتْرَبُ:])
and having little wealth: thus it bears two contr.
significations: (K:) but the former is the more
known. (TA.)
مَتْرَبَةٌ The suffering loss, and becoming poor, so
as to cleave to the dust, or earth; an inf. n. of
