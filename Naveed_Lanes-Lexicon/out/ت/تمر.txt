تَمْرٌ, a coll. gen. n.; (S, A;) masc. in one dial.
and fem. in another [like other nouns of the same
class]; (Msb;) Dates, or the fruit of the palmtree: (M:) or dried dates, like زَبِيبٌ as applied
to grapes, by general consent of the lexicologists:
(Mgh, Msb:) the dates are left upon the palmtree, after they have become ripe, until they are
dry, or nearly so, when they are cut, and left in
the sun to dry thoroughly; and sometimes, as
AHát says, the fruit of the palm-tree is cut when
full-grown but unripe, to lighten the tree, or from
fear of theft, and left until it becomes تَمْر: (Msb:)
the n. un. is with ة: and the pl. of تَمْرٌ is تُمُورٌ
and تُمْرَانٌ, (T, S, M, Msb, K,) meaning sorts or
varieties [of تَمْر]; for a coll. gen. n. has not a pl.
in the proper sense: (S:) and in like manner the
dual تَمْرَانِ means two sorts [of تَمْر]: (Sb cited
in the M in art. بسر:) the pl. of تَمْرَةٌ is تَمَرَاتٌ.
(S, K.) [See also بُسْرٌ.] Hence the prov., أَعْطِ
أَخَاكَ تَمْرَةً فَإِنْ أَبَى فَجَمْرَةً [Give thou thy brother
a dried date; and if he refuse it, a live coal].
(A, TA.) And التَّمْرُ بِالسَّوِيقِ [Dried dates with
meal of parched barley or wheat] is another prov.,
used in allusion to requital. (Lh.) And one
says, وَجَدَ عِنْدَهُ تَمْرَةَ الغُرَابِ, meaning (tropical:)  He found
with him, or at his abode, what he approved.
(A.) And نَفْسُهُ تَمْرَةٌ بِكَذَا (tropical:)  His mind is pleased,
or agreeably affected, with, or by, such a thing;
or consents to such a thing. (A, K. * [Accord. to
the TA, it is here like فَرِحَةٌ; but this seems to be
true as to the meaning; not as to the form of the
word. See also art. ثمر, voce ثَمِرٌ.]) And دَعْنِى
إِنَّ نَفْسِى غَيْرُ تَمْرَةٍ (tropical:)  [Leave thou me, or let me
alone: verily my mind is not pleased, or happy].
(A.) ―
-b2-  تَمْرٌ هِنْدِىٌّ [The fruit of the tamarindtree; thus called in the present day;] i. q. حُمَرٌ
and حَوْمَرٌ. (K in art. حمر.)
تَمْرِىٌّ One who loves تَمْر [or dried dates]. (S,
A, K.)
تَمَّارٌ A seller of تَمْر [or dried dates]. (S, A, K.)
تَامِرٌ Possessing تَمْر [or dried dates]; (S, M, A,
Msb;) like لَابِنٌ “ possessing milk: ” (S, Msb:)
or تَامِرٌ, (Lh, M, K,) or ↓ مُتْمِرٌ, (S, A,) signifies
possessing many, or a large quantity of, تَمْر: (Lh,
S, M, A, K:) the former of these two words is
held by ISd to be a possessive epithet: (TA:)
and sometimes it may signify feeding people with,
or giving them to eat, تَمْر. (S, TA.)
