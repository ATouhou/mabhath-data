ترجتُرُنْجٌ and تُرُنْجَةٌ: see what follows.
أُتْرُجُّ, (S, Msb, K, &c.,) the most chaste of the
forms here mentioned, (Az, Msb, MF, TA,) a
pl., (AHát, MF, TA,) [or rather a coll. gen. n.,]
and ↓ تُرُنْجٌ, (AZ, S, Msb, K, &c.,) [which is
Persian,] a dial. var. of weak authority, (Msb,)
by some disallowed, (MF, TA,) used by the
vulgar, (TA,) the ن in which is by common
consent held to be augmentative, (MF, TA,) likewise a pl., (TA,) [or coll. gen. n.,] and ↓ أُتْرُنْجٌ,
mentioned by Ibn-Hishám El-Lakhmee, in his
Faseeh, and also used by the vulgar, (TA,) and
by some of the people of Hims, (Lth cited in the
L voce حَظٌّ, q. v.,) [and this is likewise a coll.
gen. n.,] and أُتْرُجَّةٌ, (S, Msb, K, &c.,) which is
the sing. of the first, (AHát, MF, TA,) or its
n. un., (L, Msb,) also pronounced أُتْرُجَةٌ, without
teshdeed, (TA,) and ↓ تُرُنْجَةٌ, (AZ, S, L, &c.,)
likewise a n. un., (L,) A certain fruit, (Msb,)
well known, (L, Msb, K,) plentiful in the land of
the Arabs, but not growing wild, (L, TA,) [of
the species citrus medica, or citron; of which
there are two varieties in Egypt; one, of the
form of the lemon, but larger, there called تُرُنْج
بَلَدِىّ; the other, ribbed, and called تُرُنْج مُصَبَّع:
accord. to Golius, citrons of a large size, which
have a sweeter peel than others, and are of a size
nearly equal to that of a melon:] the sour sort
allays the lust of women, clears the complexion,
and removes the [discoloration of the face termed]
كَلَف, (K, TA,) that arises from phlegm; (TA;)
the peel thereof, put among clothes, preserves them
from the moth-worm: (K, TA:) it is also beneficial as an antidote against the various kinds of
poison; the smelling it in times of plague, or
pestilence, is beneficial in the highest degree; and
jinn, or genii, do not enter the house in which
it is; wherefore a reciter of the Kur-án is appropriately likened to it: (TA:) the pl. of أُتْرُجَّةٌ is
أُتْرُجَّاتٌ as well as أُتْرُجٌّ: [or rather the latter is
a coll. gen. n., as stated above:] but one should
not say تُرُنْجَاتٌ [app. because it is vulgar; for
it is agreeable with analogy as pl. of تُرُنْجَةٌ; as
is also أُتْرُنْجَاتٌ as pl. of ↓ أُتْرُنْجَةٌ]. (AHát, MF,
TA.)
أُتْرُنْجٌ and أُتْرُنْجَةٌ: see above.
