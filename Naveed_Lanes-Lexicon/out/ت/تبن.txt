(M,) He was, or became, intelligent, sagacious,
skilful, or knowing; syn. فَطِنَ, (K,) or صَارَ فَطِنًا;
(S;) and nice, or minute, in inspection (S, K)
into affairs: (S:) or تَبَانَةٌ signifies the being very
intelligent or sagacious or skilful or knowing, and
nice, or minute, in inspection; as also طَبَانَهٌ;
accord. to AO and AA: (T:) these two words
signify the same (T, S, M *) accord. to [most of]
the leading authorities: (T:) and Yaakoob asserts
that the ت is a substitute for ط: (M:) [or the
reverse seems to be the case in the opinion of Az,
who here remarks that there are many instances
of the change of ت into ط:] or the former is in
evil; and the latter, in good: (M:) or, accord. to
Lth, طَبِنَ means in evil; and تَبِنَ, in good; so
that he makes طبانة to be in deceiving, or beguiling, and suddenly, or unexpectedly, attacking
or destroying: but En-Nadr says the contr.; and
accord. to him, طَبَنٌ signifies the having knowledge of affairs, and intelligence, or sagacity, and
science: (T:) and ↓ تبّن, inf. n. تَتْبِينٌ signifies
the same as تَبِنَ: (K:) or he inspected nicely, or
minutely: as in a trad. in which it is said, respecting a woman whose husband has died leaving her
pregnant, يُنْفَقُ عَلَيْهَا مِنْ جَمِيعِ المَالِ حَتَّى تَبَّنْتُمْ
مَا تَبَّنْتُمْ, meaning [She shall be expended upon
from the whole of the property] until ye make a
nice, or minute, inspection [into the circumstances
of the case], and say otherwise, (T, S,) i. e., that
she shall be expended upon from her own share:
(T:) and so in another trad., in which it is said,
إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَتَكَلَّمُ بِالكَلِمَةِ يُتَبِّنُ فِيهَا يَهْوِى بِهَا فِى النَّارِ,
(A 'Obeyd, T, M,) i. e. [Verily a man will say a
saying] in which he will be nice, or minute [in
expression, whereby he will fall into the fire of
Hell]: (TA:) here A 'Obeyd thinks the meaning
to be the making language obscure, or abstruse,
and disputing in a matter of religion. (T.) You
