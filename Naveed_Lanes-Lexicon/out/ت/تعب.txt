تعب1
تَعِبَ, (S, A, Msb, K,) aor.
تَعَبَ, (A, K,) inf. n.
تَعَبٌ, (S, Msb,) He [a man and a beast] was, or
became, fatigued, tired, wearied [by labour or
journeying &c.], or jaded; (S, A, Msb;) contr.
of اِسْتَرَاحَ. (K.) [تَعَبٌ, which, used as a simple
subst., may be rendered Fatigue, tiredness, weariness, or the state of being jaded, is here said in
the TA to be contr. of رَاحَةٌ; and to signify شِدَّةُ
العَنَآءِ, which may be rendered much fatigue &c.;
but accord. to an explanation of the verb of عَنَآءٌ
in the S and TA in art. عنى, this word and تَعَبٌ
signify the same. See also مَتْعَبٌ.]

اتعب He fatigued, tired, wearied, or jaded,
another; (S, Msb, K;) and himself, in a work
that he imposed upon himself, or in which he
laboured; and his travelling-camels, by urging
them quickly, or by hard journeying. (TA.) ―
-b2-
(tropical:)  He broke a bone again after it had been set, or
consolidated: or he caused a bone to have a defect
in it, after it had been set, so that there remained
in it a constant swelling, or resulted a lameness:
اتعب العَظْمَ signifying أَعْنَتَهُ بَعْدَ الجَبْرِ: (so in the
CK:) or أَعْتَبَهُ بعد الجبر. (So in MS. copies of
the K and in the TA. [In the latter, in art.
عتب, this reading is confirmed; but a remark
below, voce مُتْعَبٌ, rather favours the former
reading, that of the CK.]) ―
-b3-  (tropical:)  He filled a vessel;
(A, K;) as, for instance, a drinking-cup, or bowl.
(A.)
-A2-  اتعب القَوْمُ The people's cattle became
fatigued, tired, wearied, or jaded. (K.)
تَعِبٌ Fatigued, tired, wearied, or jaded; as
also ↓ مُتْعَبٌ; (S, Msb, K;) but not مَتْعُوبٌ. (S,
K.) [↓ تَعْبَان, for تَعْبَانٌ, fem. with ة, is used
in this sense in the present day.]
تَعْبَان: see what next precedes.
مَتْعَبٌ A place of تَعَب [or fatigue, &c.]: ―
-b2-
and tropically, syn. with تَعَبٌ: pl. مَتَاعِبُ. (Har
p. 431.)
مُتْعَبٌ: see تَعِبٌ. ―
-b2-  Also (tropical:)  A camel that has
had a bone of one of his fore legs or hind legs
broken and set, and has been fatigued beyond his
power of endurance before the bone has consolidated, so that the fracture has become complete:
whence the phrase عَظْمٌ مُتْعَبٌ [app. meaning (tropical:)  a
bone broken again after its having been set, or
consolidated: see 4]. (TA.) ―
-b3-  A vessel, as, for
instance, a drinking-cup, or bowl, (tropical:)  filled. (TA.)
―
-b4-  Water (tropical:)  squeezed forth, or expressed, from the
earth, to be drunk. (A, TA.)
مَتْعَبَةٌ [A cause of fatigue or weariness: a word
of the same class as مَجْبَنَةٌ and مَبْخَلَةٌ: loosely
explained in Har p. 475 as meaning a place of
fatigue]. One says, اِسْتِخْرَاجُ المُعَمَّى مَتْعَبَةٌ
لِلْخَوَاطِرِ [The eliciting of the meaning of that
which is made enigmatical is a cause of fatigue
to minds]. (A.)
