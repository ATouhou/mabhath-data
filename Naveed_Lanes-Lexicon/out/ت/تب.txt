or being lost: and perishing, or dying: or [used

be] a subst. from تَبَّبَهُ, with teshdeed, (Msb,) and
↓ تَبَبٌ and ↓ تَبِيبٌ: (K:) or the last three signify
[simply] perdition, or death: (M:) and ↓ تَتْبِيبٌ
is explained as signifying loss, or diminution, that
brings, or leads, to perdition or death; (IAth,
TA;) and so ↓ تَبَابٌ; (Bd in cxi. 1;) and the
causing to perish. (T, TA.) Hence you say,

he suffer loss, or be lost, or perish]. (S.) And
تَبًّا لَهُ May God decree to him loss, or perdition;
or cause loss, or perdition, to cleave to him: (S,
M, * Msb, * K: *) تَبًّا being in the accus. case as
an inf. n. governed by a verb understood. (S.)
And ↓ تَبًّا تَبِيبًا, [in the CK تَتْبِيبًا,] meaning the
same in an intensive, or emphatic, manner: (M,
K:) and ↓ تَبًّا تَبَابًا. (TA.) And تَبَّتْ يَدَاهُ, (T, S,
M, K,) and تَبَّتْ يَدُهُ, aor.
تَبِ3َ, (Msb,) inf. n. تَبٌّ

seems to be the inf. n., and the latter the simple
subst., (M,) May his arms, or hands, and his
arm, or hand, suffer loss, or be lost, or perish:
(T, M, Msb, K, and Bd in cxi. 1:) or (tropical:)  may he himself suffer loss, &c., (Msb, * and Bd ubi suprà,)
i. e., (tropical:)  his whole person: (Jel in cxi. 1:) or (tropical:)  his
