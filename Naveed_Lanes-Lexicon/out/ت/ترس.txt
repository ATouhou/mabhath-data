تُرْسٌ [A shield;] a certain piece of defensive
armour; (M, TA;) a thing well known: (A,
Msb, K:) pl. تِرَسَةٌ and تِرَاسٌ (S, M, Msb, K) and
تِرَاسَةٌ (S) and تُرُوسٌ, [all pls. of mult.,] and أَتْرَاسٌ,
[a pl. of pauc.,] (S, M, Msb, K,) but not أَتْرِسَةٌ.
(ISk, S, Msb.) A تُرْس that is made of skins,
without wood and without sinews in it, is called
حَجَفَةٌ and دَرَقَةٌ. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  Also (tropical:)  The disk of
the sun. (A, * TA.) ―
-b3-  And (tropical:)  A smooth, round,
level piece of ground: (A, TA:) or a rugged
piece of hard, or hard and level, ground. (Ibn-
'Abbád, K.) ―

تَارِسٌ: see تَرَّاسٌ.
مَتَرْسٌ; so accord. to El-Háfidh Ibn-Hajar, and
this is the correct form; written in the T and the
Towsheeh مَتَّرْسٌ; and by some, مَتْرَسٌ [as in the
CK]; and by some, مَتْرَسٌ [as I find it in two
copies of the S and in a copy of the K]; (TA;)
[A wooden door-bar;] a piece of wood that is put
behind the door; (S, K) the شِجَار [or wooden
bar] that is put against the door as a stay: (T,
L, TA:) [مَتَرْسْ is] a Persian word, [having the
above-mentioned signification, but originally a
contraction of مَهْ تَرْسْ, and] meaning “ fear not
thou,” with it [being here understood]: (T, K,
TA:) or the name of this piece of wood in Arabic
is ↓ تُرْسٌ: (M, TA:) which also signifies a piece
of wood with which a couch-frame (سَرِير) is
repaired, by its being affixed as a ضَبَّة: (M:)
[and the Arabic word شِجَارٌ has this latter signification also:] the Persian word is مَتَرْسْ. (M,
TA.) ―
-b2-  Their saying مَتَرْس, with fet-h to the م
and ت, and sukoon to the ر means [also] Security
[is given] to thee, therefore fear thou not: it is
said to be Persian. (Msb.)
مَتْرَسَةٌ, (M, A,) or متْرَسَةٌ, (K, accord. to the
TA, [and so I find in a MS. copy of that work,
and in the CK, but the former is probably the
correct form, being agreeable with analogy, like
مَبْخَلَةٌ and مَجْبَنَةٌ &c.,]) Anything by which one
is defended, or protected. (M, Msb, K.) You
say also هُوَ مَتْرَسَةٌ لَكَ (tropical:)  [He is a cause of defence,
or protection, to thee]. (A.)
بَابٌ مَتْرُوسٌ A door fastened, or closed, [with a
bar, or] in any manner. (TA.)
