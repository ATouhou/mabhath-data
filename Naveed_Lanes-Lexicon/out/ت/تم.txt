تَمِ3َ, (T, M,
K,) inf. n. تَمَامٌ, (T, S,) or تِمَامٌ, (M,) or both,
and تُمَامٌ, (K,) and تَمَامَةٌ (M, K) and تِمَامَةٌ, (K,)
and تمُّ and تَمٌّ and تُمٌّ, (M, K,) of which last
three forms the first is said to be the most chaste,
(TA,) [The thing was, or became, complete, entire,
whole, or full; i. e., without, or free from, deficiency: and sometimes, the thing was, or became,
consummate, or perfect; which latter signification
is more properly expressed by كَمَلَ:] accord. to
the author of the K, as is shown in art. كمل, and
accord. to some others, تَمَامٌ and كَمَالٌ are syn.;
but several authors make a distinction between
them: the former is said to signify a thing's being,
or becoming, without, or free from, deficiency;
and the latter, to signify تمام and something
more, as, for instance, goodliness, and excellence,
essential or accidental; though each is sometimes
used in the sense of the other: or, as some say,
the former necessarily implies previous deficiency;
but the latter does not: (MF, TA:) or, accord.
to El-Harállee, the latter signifies the attaining to
the utmost point, or degree, in every respect: or,
as Ibn-El-Kemál says, when one says of a thing
كَمَلَ, he means that what was desired of it
became realized. (TA.) [See also تَمَامٌ, below.]
You say, تَمَّ خَلْقُهُ [His make, or formation, was,
or became, complete, or perfect; he (a child or
the like, and a man,) was, or became, fully formed
or developed, or complete in his members; and he
(a man) was, or became, full-grown]: (TA:)
[whence, probably,] تَمَّ الشَّىْءُ [as meaning] The
thing became strong and hard. (Msb.) And
تَمَّ القَمَرُ, (T, S, Msb,) or ↓ اتمّ, (M, K,) The
moon became full, so that it shone brightly. (M,

and إِلَيْهِ ↓ اتمّ, He repaired, or betook himself, to,

p. 508.) Aboo-Dhu-eyb says,
فَبَاتَ بِجَمْعٍ ثُمَّ تَمَّ إِلَى مِنًى
[which may be rendered And he passed the night
in Jema (a name of El-Muzdelifeh): then he
repaired, or went, to Minè; there completing the
ceremonies of the pilgrimage; wherefore ISd
says,] I think that, by تمّ, [or rather تمّ الى منى,]
he means he completed his pilgrimage. (M.) ―
-b4-
تَمَّ بِهِ, and تَمَّ عَلَيْهِ: see their syn. اتمّهُ (4). ―

[Hence,] تَمَّ عَلَيْهِ He performed it, or executed
it; he accomplished it; namely, an affair; a fast;
a purpose, or an intention. (Mgh.) ―

persevered in it; (Mgh, TA;) as also تَمَمَ عَلَيْهِ,
without teshdeed, as in the phrase إِنْ تَمَمَتْ عَلَى
مَا أُرِيدُ [If she persevere in what I desire], occurring in a trad.; but IAth says that the verb here
means ↓ تَمَّمَتْ. (TA.) You say, تَمَّ عَلَى الإبَآءِ He
persevered in refusal, or dislike, or disapproval.
(Mgh.)

↓ ظَلَعَ فُلَانٌ ثُمَّ تَتَمَّمَ, i. e. [Such a one limped, or
halted, or was slightly lame: then] his lameness
became complete by fracture: from تُمَّ signifying
“ it was broken: ” (T:) [or تَتَمَّمَ signifies his
lameness became complete by an increased fracture, after he had had a fracture with which he
was able to walk: this is what is meant by the
following loose explanation:] التَّتَمُّمُ مَنْ كَانَ بِهِ

(Lth, T, K,) as one of the tribe of Temeem; (Lth,

R. Q. 1
تَمْتَمَةٌ is the inf. n. of تَمْتَمَ, (Msb,)
and signifies The reiterating in uttering the letter
ت: (Mbr, Zj in his “ Khalk el-Insán,” T, S,
Msb:) [if so, syn. with تَأْتَأَةٌ:] or the tongue's

like ت and م, though this be not distinct: (Lth,
T:) or the making the speech [or tongue] to revert
[repeatedly] to ت and م: (M, K:) or the jabbering, or hurrying in one's speech, so as hardly,

تُمَمٌ, (K, TA,) or ↓ تَمَمٌ, which [ISd says] I think
to be a quasi-pl. n., (M,) or ↓ تَمٌّ is the quasipl. n.: (K:) these, i. e. the pls. and quasi-pl. n.,
signify Shorn crops (جِزَز [in the CK جِزَر, for

has rendered it by “ amuletum,” and Freytag has
done the same,]) of شَعَر [meaning goats' hair],
and of camels' hair, and of wool, (M, K, TA,) of
that wherewith a woman [or a man] completes
her [or his] web: (TA:) and ↓ تُمَّةٌ signifies what

تَمِيمَةٌ A kind of amulet (عُوذَةٌ, T, S) which is
hung upon a human being; forbidden to be worn:
(S:) or a kind of bead: (S, Mgh:) erroneously
imagined by some to be the same as مَعَاذَةٌ: (El-
Kutabee, Mgh:) but as to the مَعَاذَات that are
inscribed with something from the Kur-án, or
with the names of God, in these there is no harm:
(S, Mgh:) a speckled bead, black speckled with
white, or the reverse, which is strung upon a
thong, and tied to the neck: (M, K:) sing. of
تَمَائِمُ and [n. un. of] ↓ تَمِيمٌ: (T, M, K:) تَمَائِمُ
signifies certain beads which the Arabs of the
desert used to hang upon their children, to repel,
as they asserted, the evil eye: (T, Mgh:) or the
تَمِيمَة is, accord. to some, a necklace (قِلَادَة) upon
which are put thongs and amulets (عُوَذ): (M:)
or a necklace (قِلَادَة) of thongs: and is sometimes
applied to the amulet (عُوذَة) that is hung upon
the necks of children: (T:) but he who makes
تمائم to signify thongs is in error: El-Farezdak
uses the phrase سُيُورُ التَّمَائِمِ because they are
beads which are perforated, and into which are
inserted thongs or strings whereby they are suspended: (T, Mgh:) Az says, I have not found
among the Arabs of the desert any difference of
opinion respecting the تميمة, as to its being the
bead itself: (TA:) but accord. to En-Nakha'ee,
the Prophet disapproved of everything hung upon
a child or grown person, and said that all such
things were تمائم: (Mgh:) the تميمة is [said to
be] thus called because by it the condition of the
child is rendered complete. (Har p. 22.)
تِمَامِىٌّ: see تَمَامٌ.
تَمْتَامٌ One whose utterance is such as is termed
تَمْتَمَةٌ: (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K:) [see R. Q. 1:
accord. to most authorities,] one who reiterates in
uttering the letter ت: (S, Mgh, Msb:) or, accord.

Msb:) fem. with ة. (M, K.)
تَامٌّ [part. n. of 1 in the first of the senses explained above]: (T, M, K, &c.:) Complete, entire,
whole, or full; without, or free from, deficiency:
and consummate, or perfect: (MF, TA:) as also
↓ تَمَامٌ, [which see above,] (M, * KL,) [and ↓ تِمَامٌ,
of which see three exs. voce تَمَامٌ,] and ↓ تِمٌّ, (Kh,
T, Har p. 82,) and ↓ تَمَمٌ. (TA.) Thus تَامُّ الخَلْقِ
signifies Complete, or perfect, in make, or formation; without any deficiency in his members;
applied to a man; (MF, TA;) [and, thus applied,
signifying also full-grown, as does, sometimes,
تَامٌّ alone: and likewise applied to a new-born
child, meaning fully formed or developed:] and
↓ تَمِيمٌ signifies the same, (M, K,) applied to a
man and to a horse, (M,) and ↓ تَمَمٌ also; and in
like manner is used the phrase ↓ خَلْقٌ تَمَمٌ [a
complete, or perfect, make or formation]. (TA.)
جَذَعٌ تَامٌّ [applied to a goat] signifies That has
completed the time in which he is termed جَذَع,
and attained to that in which he is termed تَيْس.
(TA.) And ↓ تَمَمٌ is applied to a bull, or an ox,
That is in the stage of growth next before that in
which all his teeth are grown; in which latter
stage he is termed عَمَمٌ. (L voce عَضْبٌ, on the
authority of Et-Táïfee.) You say also كَلِمَةٌ تَامَّةٌ,
and دَعْوَهٌ تَامَّةٌ; [meaning A perfect, or faultless,
sentence, and oath;] using the epithet تامّة in
these instances because of the mention of God
therein; for which reason there may not be in
aught of either of them any deficiency or defect.
(TA.) And ↓ جَعَلَهُ تِمًّا i. e. ↓ تَمَامًا [He made it
complete, or perfect]. (M.) And ↓ جَعَلْتُهُ لَكَ تِمًّا
I made it, or have made it, to be thine, or I
assigned it, or have assigned it, to thee, completely,
or wholly. (T.) ―
-b2-  [Hence, فِعْلٌ تَامٌّ meaning A
complete, i. e. an attributive, verb: opposed to
فِعْلٌ نَاقِصٌ.]
تَتِمَّةٌ: see تَمَامٌ, in three places, at the close of
the paragraph.
مُتَمٌّ The place of cutting, or termination,
(مُنْقَطَع, in the CK مُنْقَطِع,) of the vein (عِرْق
[app. meaning chord]) of the navel. (K.)

a woman, (M, TA,) and a she-camel, (M,) That
has completed the days of her gestation: (S:) or
that is near to bringing forth: (M:) or that is
at the point of bringing forth. (TA.)
مُتَمِّمٌ One whose arrow wins time after time
[in the game called المَيْسِر], and who feeds the
poor with the flesh [of the camel which constitutes
the shares] thereof: (M, K:) or who, when players
in the game called الميسر have diminished the
slaughtered camel [by taking their shares], takes
what has remained, so as to complete the shares,
or make up their full number. (K. [See 2. In
the CK, نَقَصَ اِيْسارَ جَزُوْرِ المَيْسِرِ is erroneously
put for نَقَصَ أَيْسَارٌ جَزُورَ المَيْسِرِ.])
الجَهَالَةُ المُسْتَتَمَّةُ Consummate ignorance: improperly written المُسْتَتِمَّةُ, though this latter is
explainable [as meaning that completes the extent
to which it can go, or the like]. (Mgh.)
مُسْتَتِمٌّ One who seeks, demands, or requests,
wool, or camels' hair, to complete therewith the
weaving of his كِسَآء: so in a poem of Aboo-Duwád, (S,) where he says,
فَهْىَ كَالبَيْضِ فِى الأَدَاحِىِّ لَا يُوْ
هَبُ مِنْهَا لِمُسْتَتِمٍّ عِصَامُ
i. e., And they (referring to certain camels) are,
in respect of the care that is taken of them, and
in smoothness, like the eggs [in the places where
the ostrich has deposited them in the sand]; there
may not be found upon them to be given from
them, to one who demands a تِمَّة, [even so much
as] a tie for a water-skin; for they have become
fat, and cast their hair. (TA.)
