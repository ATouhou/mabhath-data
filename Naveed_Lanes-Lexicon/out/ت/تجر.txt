تِجَارَةٌ a subst. from 1; (Msb;) or quasi-inf. n.;
(Mgh;) [The practice of traffic, merchandise, or
commerce; traffic; trade; selling and buying;]
the trade of the تَاجِر, i. e., of him who sells and

gain by selling and buying. (Bd ibid.) [See also
1.] ―
-b2-  Also Merchandise, meaning what is sold
and bought, of goods, or commodities, or householdfurniture, and the like; a quasi-inf. n. used in
the sense of a pass. part. n. (Mgh.) [Hence the
saying,] عَلَيْكُمْ بِتِجَارَةِ الآخِرَةِ (tropical:)  [Keep ye to the
merchandise of the life to come]. (A.)
تَاجِرٌ A merchant; one who practises traffic,
merchandise, or commerce; a trafficker; a trader,
or tradesman; a dealer; one who sells and buys;
(K;) one who sells and buys for gain: (Ksh in
ii. 15:) and a vintner, or seller of wine, (S, K,)
was also called thus by the Arabs: (S:) accord.
to IAth, this latter is said to be the primary signification: and hence the saying in a trad., إِنَّ
التَّاجِرَ فَاجِرٌ [Verily the vintner is a transgressor]:
(TA:) pl. تُجَّارٌ and تِجَارٌ and ↓ تَجْرٌ, (S, Msb,
K,) [or rather this last is a quasi-pl. n.,] like as
صَحْبٌ is of صَاحِبٌ, (S, Msb,) and تُجُرٌ, (K,) or
this may be a pl. of تِجَارٌ. (ISd, TA.) ↓ التَّجِرُ.
occurring in a verse of El-Akhtal, [for التَّاجِرُ,] is
thought by ISd to be like طَهِرٌ [for طَاهِرٌ]. (TA.)
―

TA.) The Arabs say, إِنَّهُ لَتَاجِرٌ بِذٰلِكَ الأَمْرِ

―
-b3-  And (tropical:)  A she-camel that is saleable, or easy of
sale, or in much demand, in traffic, and in the
market; (A 'Obeyd, S, K;) as also تَاجِرَةٌ: (K:)
or the latter, a she-camel that is goodly, and saleable, or in much demand: (A:) or that is easy
of sale when offered, by reason of her excellence:
(T:) or simply, that is easy of sale, or in much
demand: (S:) as though, by reason of her beauty,
or goodliness, and fatness, she sold herself: (Ksh
in ii. 15:) contr. of كَاسِدَةٌ: (S, * TA:) the pl.
of تاجرة is تَوَاجِرُ. (T, A.) You say also, عَلَيْكَ
بِالسِّلَعِ التَّوَاجِرِ (tropical:)  [Keep thou to the commodities]
that are saleable, or in much demand. (A.) And
هُوَ عَلَى أَكْرَمِ تَاجِرَةٍ (assumed tropical:)  He is upon a most noble
horse. (K.)
