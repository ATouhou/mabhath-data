in the side of a river, whence it flows forth:
(Msb:) pl. تُرَعٌ (IB, Msb) and تُرْعَاتٌ and تُرَعَاتٌ
and تُرُعَاتٌ: (Msb:) in the S it is said to signify
the mouths of streamlets or rivulets; but correctly

this signification. (IB.) ―
-b2-  A canal, or channel
of water, to a meadow or garden or the like: (L,

said in a trad., إِنَّ مِنْبَرِي هٰذَا عَلَى تُرْعَةٍ مِنْ تُرَعِ
الجَنَّةِ, (S, TA,) as though meaning, (tropical:)  Verily this
my pulpit is at a gate of the gates of Paradise:
thus explained by Sahl Ibn-Saad Es-Sá'idee, the
relater of the trad.; and A'Obeyd says, وَهُوَ الوَجْهُ
[“ and it is the proper,” or “ the valid and obvious,
way,” of explaining it], meaning that it is the
preferable explanation: but the author of the K,
mistaking his meaning, makes وَجْهٌ to be another
signification of تُرْعَةٌ: or the meaning of this trad.
is, he who acts according to the exhortations
recited upon the steps of my pulpit will enter
Paradise: or, accord. to Kt, prayer and praise in
this place are means of attaining to Paradise; so
that it is as though it were a portion of Paradise.
(TA.) In the same manner Sahl explained his
other trad,, إِنَّ قَدَمِى عَلَى تُرْعَةٍ مِنْ تُرَعِ الحَوْضِ
(tropical:)  [Verily my foot is at a gate of the gates of the
pool of Paradise]. (TA.)

↓ the latter, a vehement torrent. (TA.) J says,
in the S, that ↓ سَيْرٌ أَنْزَعُ signifies شَدِيدٌ; and he
cites the words of a poet thus:
فَافْتَرَشَ الأَرْضَ بِسَيْرٍ أَتْرَعَا
ascribed by some to El-'Ajjáj, but correctly, accord.
to IB, the words of Ru-beh; making two mistakes, in saying افترش, in the sing., and بسير:
moreover, the last word in the citation is a pret.
verb: [the right reading is]
فَافْتَرَشُوا الأَرْضَ بِسَيْلٍ أَتْرَعَا
[And they travelled the land with a multitude
like a torrent that filled the valleys]: the poet
describes the Benoo-Temeem, and their travelling
the land like the torrent by reason of multitude.
