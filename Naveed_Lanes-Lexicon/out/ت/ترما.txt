ترمالَا تَرَمَا i. q. لا سِيَّمَا [which see in art. سوي].
(K.)
تُرْمُسٌ [vulgarly pronounced in the present day
تِرْمِس; from the Greek θέρμο�, or Coptic θαρο�;
Lupines; or the lupine;] a certain grain, well
known, of the description termed قَطَانِىّ; (Msb;)
the produce of a tree [or plant] which has
a grain ribbed and notched: (Lth, M, * K:)
or i. q. بَاقِلَّى مِصْرِىٌّ: (the Minháj and K:) [but
if this be the same as the بَاقِلَّى قِبْطِىّ, it is a
mistake, accord. to Ibn-Beytár, to identify it with
the ترمس:] AHn says that it is the جِرْجِير مِصْرِىّ,
and is of the description termed قَطَانِىّ; and under
the head of the letter ج, he says that the جِرْجِير
is the بَاقِلِّى: accord. to the Minháj, it is a grain
of an expanded shape, of bitter taste, hollowed in
the middle; and the wild kind is smaller than
the other, and stronger: and the ترمس approaches
more to medicine than to food: the best is the
white, large, and heavy: (TA:) some say that
the ت is augmentative, and that the word is from
رَمَسَ, signifying “ he concealed ” a thing: (MF,
TA:) the n. un. is with ة (Msb.)
