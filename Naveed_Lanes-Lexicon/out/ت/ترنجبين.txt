ترنجبينتَرَنْجُبِينٌ and تَرَنْجَبِينٌ and تُرَنْجَبِينٌ [thus
variously written, in the last manner in the TA, and
there said to be “ with damm; ” from the Persian
تَرَنْگُبِينْ; A kind of manna; the manna of the
thorny plant called by the Arabs the حَاج, and
hence by European botanists “ alhagi: ” accord.
to Dr. Royle (art. “ Man ” in Kitto's Cycl. of
Bibl. Lit.), it is a sweetish juice which exudes
from the alhagi maurorum, concretes into small
granular masses, and is usually distinguished by
the name of Persian manna: he also states that
the alhagi maurorum and another species, alhagi
desertorum, are ‘ called in Mesopotamia “ agool,”
according to some authorities, while by others
this is thought to be the name of another plant: ’
by “ agool ” is meant عَاقُول, q. v.:] a kind of
dew (طَلٌّ), that falls mostly in Khurásán and in
Ma-waráli-n-nahr, and, in our country, mostly
upon the حاج: the best thereof is that which is
fresh, or moist, and white: (Ibn-Seenà, or
“ Avicenna,” vol. i. of the Arabic ed., p. 262:)
the مَنّ [or manna] mentioned in the Kur-án
[ii. 54]. (Ksh, Bd, Jel, TA.) [See also “ Ibn
Baithar ” (Ibn-Beytár), vol. i. p. 207.]
