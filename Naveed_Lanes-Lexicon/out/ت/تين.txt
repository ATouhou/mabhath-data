تينتِينٌ The tree of the بَلَس [or common fig; ficus
carica]: or the بلس itself: (M:) [or both; i. e.]
a certain well-known kind of tree; and the fruit
thereof: (TA:) [or the latter only;] a certain
thing that is eaten, (S, Msb,) well known: (Msb,
K:) fresh and ripe, it is the most approved of
fruits, and the most nutritious, and the least
flatulent; drawing, dissolvent, having the property of opening obstructions of the liver and
spleen, and laxative; and the eating much thereof
engenders lice: (K: [the last word in this explanation in the K is مُقْمِلٌ, which I render agreeably
with the TK, having found no authoritative explanation of it: but in my own opinion, the
meaning of this word is fattening, for قَمِلَ signifies “ he became fat after being lean; ” and my
opinion is confirmed by what here follows:]) it is
a pleasant fruit, having nothing redundant, and a
nice food, quick of digestion, and a very useful
medicine, for it has a laxative property, dissolves
phlegm, purifies the kidneys, removes sand of the
bladder, opens obstructions of the liver and spleen,
and fattens the body: it is also said, in a trad.,
that it stops hemorrhoids, and is good for the
gout: (Bd xcv. 1:) AHn says, there are many
kinds thereof; that of the desert, that of the
cultivated land, that of the plains, and that of
the mountains; and it is abundant in the land of
the Arabs: and he adds, on the authority of an
Arab of the desert, of the Saráh, that it is, in the
Saráh, very abundant, and allowed to be commonly taken; and is eaten by the people there in
its fresh state, and also dried and stored: (M:)
the word is Arabic: (Msb:) [a coll. gen. n.:]
n. un. with ة. (S, M, Msb.) This is what is
meant in the Kur [xcv. 1], where it is said,
وَالتِّينِ وَالزَّيْتُونِ, (T, S, M, Msb,) accord. to I'Ab,
(T, S, Bd, Jel,) and the generality of the interpreters: (Msb:) or these two words mean two
mountains (S, M, Bd, Jel) of Syria, (S, Jel,) or
of the Holy Land, (Bd,) that produce the two
fruits thus named: (Jel:) or, accord. to a Syrian
interpreter, certain mountains extending from
Hulwán, to Hemdán, and the mountains of Syria:
(Fr, T:) or Damascus and Jerusalem: (M, Bd:)
or the mosque of Damascus and that of Jerusalem: (Bd:) or two mosques in Syria: accord.
to AHn, the former is the name of a mountain in
the country of Ghatafán; but there is no mountain thus called in Syria. (M.) ―
-b2-  Among the
kinds of تِين is that called تِينُ الجُمَّيْزِ [The sycamore-fig; ficus sycomorus; also called the Egyptian fig]; describe voce جُمَّيْزٌ, q. v. (AHn.) ―
-b3-
[التِّينُ الإِفْرَنْجِىُّ and التِّينُ الشَّوْكِىُّ are appellations
applied in the present day to The Indian fig, or
prickly pear; cactus opuntia: Forskål (Flora
Aegypt. Arab. p. lxvii) applies the former name
to the cochineal Indian fig; cactus cochinillifer.]

unable to see his right course: (S, TA:) [or his
mind, or intellect, was, or became, disordered,

he perished. (TA in art. توه.) You say also,
تَاهَتْ بِهِ سَفِينَتُهُ His ship deviated from the right
course with him. (TA.) And تَاهَ عَنِّى بَصَرُكَ
Thine eye, or thy sight, passed me over; syn.
تَخَطَّى. (Aboo-Turáb, TA.) تَاهَ بَصَرَهُ [in the CK,
erroneously, قَصْرُهُ] signifies also تَافَ, (K, TA,

to be commended for, or praised for, or he gloried
in, that which he did not possess; [i. e. he was,
or became, conceited, or vain-glorious; or he
overpassed the due bounds in elegance of mind or
manners or address or speech or person or attire
and the like, and arrogated to himself superiority
therein, through pride: (K:) [or rather, he was,
or became, vain; or he behaved vainly: for] Er-Rághib makes a distinction between مُعْجَبٌ and
تَائِهٌ; saying that the معجب believes himself
with respect to the opinion or judgment that he
forms of himself indecisively, from evidence outweighed in probability; whereas the تائه believes
himself decisively. (MF and TA in art. عجب.)
One says, هُوَ يَتِيهُ عَلَى قَوْمِهِ [He behaves proudly,
or conceitedly, or vainly, towards his people].
