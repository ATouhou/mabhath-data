اتهم He (a man, S) went, (S,) or came, (K,)
to Tihámeh: (S, K:) Er-Riyáshee says, I have
heard the Arabs of the desert say thus of him
who has descended from the mountain-roads of
Dhát 'Irk: (TA:) or he alighted, or abode,
therein: (K:) as also ↓ تَاهَمَ, (JK, K, TA, [in
the CK, erroneously, تَاهَّمَ,]) in the latter sense,
(JK,) and ↓ تتهّم; (K;) or these mean he came
to Tihámeh. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Accord. to Golius, on
the authority of a gloss. in the KL, it signifies also,
He went into a region of hot air: and this, if
correct, may be the primary meaning.]
-A2-  اتهم
البَلَدَ He found the country, or town, to be insalubrious, (K, TA,) and to have a bad, or foul,
odour. (TA.)
-A3-  اتهم, inf. n. إِتْهَامٌ; in measure
like أَكْرَمَ, inf. n. إِكْرَامٌ; (Msb;) [originally
اوهم; or] formed from تُهَمَةٌ, in consequence of
imagining the ت in this word to be radical;
(MF in art. وهم;) [like as is said of أَتْخَمَ;] He
did a thing that made him an object of suspicion:
(JK and Msb and TA in the present art.:) or
he was an object of suspicion: (K in art. وهم:
[in the CK and TK, erroneously, اتّهم:]) or there
was in him that which induced suspicion: you
say of a man, when you suspect him, أَتْهَمْتَ,
inf. n. إِتْهَامٌ; like أَدْوَأْتَ, inf. n. إِدْوَآءٌ. (S in art.

of him; as also ↓ اِتَّهَمَهُ [which is the more

(K, and so in some copies of the S, both in art.
وهم,) inf. n. إِتْهَامٌ; (K in that art.;) or بِهِ ↓ اِتَّهَمَهُ;
(Msb and K, and so in some copies of the S, all
in that art.;) and أَوْهَمَهُ; (K in that art.;) He

him; (Msb and K * and TA, all in that art.;)
[and he accused him of such a thing;] i. e.,
a thing attributed to him. (TA.) And ↓ اِتَّهَمْتُهُ
فِى قَوْلِهِ [I suspected him in respect of his saying;]
I doubted of the correctness, or truth, of his
saying. (Msb in art. وهم.)

إِتَّهَمَ see 4, in three places.
تَهَمٌ [in the CK, erroneously, تَهْم] Land descending (أَرْضٌ مُتَصَوِّبَةٌ [in the CK, here and afterwards,
erroneously, مُتَصَوِّيَة]) to the sea; as also ↓ تَهَمَةٌ;
(K, TA;) mentioned by IKt, from Ez-Ziyádee,
from As: (TA:) these two words seem to be
[originally] inf. ns. from تِهَامَةُ: (K:) [and accord.
to F,] ↓ التَّهْمَةُ is a dial. var. of ↓ تِهَامَةُ: (K:)
[but J says,] ↓ التَّهَمَةُ is used in the place of
↓ تِهَامَةُ, as though it were [originally] the inf. n. un.,
accord. to the saying of As that التَّهَمُ, with fet-h
to the medial radical, is an inf. n. from ↓ تِهَامَةُ:
(S:) for the ↓ تَهَائِم [pl. of تِهَامَةُ, and thus meaning the parts of Tihámeh, or, accord. to the JK,
meaning lands descending to the sea,] do descend
to the sea: (K, TA:) so says As: (TA:) and
[hence] the rájiz says, (namely, Sheytán Ibn-Mudlij, TA,)
نَظَرْتُ وَالعَيْنُ مُبِينَةُ التَّهَمْ
[I looked, the eye distinguishing Et-Taham], (S,
and Ham p. 659,) meaning Et-Tihámeh. (Ham
ibid.) ―
-b2-  [As inf. n. of تَهِمَ, q. v.,] التَّهَمُ also signifies Vehemence of heat, and [or with] stillness
of the wind. (K.) And hence Tihámeh is said
to be thus called. (TA.)
تَهِمٌ, applied to flesh-me., Altered for the
worse; (JK;) having a foul odour; stinking.
(JK, * K.) ―
-b2-  أَرْضٌ تَهِمَةٌ A land vehemently, or
intensely, hot. (Er-Riyáshee, TA.)
-A2-  Sleeping;
(JK;) i. q. تَهِنٌ. (TA in art. لعث.)
التَّهْمَةُ: see تَهَمٌ. ―
-b2-  It, (K,) or ↓ التَّهَمَةُ, (JK,)
signifies also البَلْدَةُ [app. as meaning Mekkeh,
like ↓ تِهَامَةُ; as though the city of cities]: (JK,
K:) so in the phrase ↓ أَهْلُ التَّهَمَةِ [which may
mean The people of Mekkeh; and also, of Tihá-
meh, in the more extended sense of the latter
appellation]. (JK.)
تُهْمَةٌ: see تُهَمَةٌ.
فِيهِ تَهَمَةٌ In it is a foul odour; a stink. (K.)
―
-b2-  See also تَهَمٌ. ―
-b3-  التَّهَمَةُ: see تَهَمٌ, and التَّهْمَةُ;
the latter in two places.
تُهَمَةٌ, (S, M, K, &c., in art. وهم, and Msb in
that art. and in the present also,) of which ↓ تُهْمَةٌ
is a dial. var. mentioned by El-Fárábee (Msb,
and TA in art. وهم) and by several other authors,
or, accord. to Ibn-Kemál, the latter is an inf. n.
and the former is a simple subst., but Esh-Shiháb
doubts of this; (TA;) originally وَهَمَةٌ, (S, ISd,
Msb, &c.,) like as تُخَمَةٌ is originally وُخَمَةٌ;
(ISd, TA;) a subst. from اِتَّهَمَهُ; (S, Msb, both
in art. وهم;) Doubt: and [more commonly]
suspicion, or evil opinion; or doubt combined
with suspicion or evil opinion: syn. شَكٌّ: and رِيبَةٌ:
(Msb in the present art.:) or i. q. ظَنٌّ [which is
a preponderating wavering between the two extremes of indecisive belief; and often means suspicion]: (ISd and TA in art. وهم:) or a thing
for which one is suspected: (K in that art.:
[and this is often meant by رِيبَةٌ, one of the syns.
mentioned above:]) the pl. of تُهْمَةٌ is تُهَمٌ, mentioned by Sb, who argues that it is a pl. [and not
a coll. gen. n.] from their saying هِىَ التُّهَمُ [They
are suspicions, &c.], and not saying هُوَ التُّهَمُ like
as they say هُوَ الرُّطَبُ. (TA in art. وهم.)
تَهَامٍ: see تِهَامِىٌّ.
تَهِيمٌ Suspected; thought evil of; (JK in this
art., and Msb in this and in art. وهم;) [as also
↓ مُتَّهَمٌ and ↓ مُتْهَمٌ:] or being an object of suspicion;
as also ↓ مُتْهِمٌ. (K in art. وهم. [In the CK, the
latter is erroneously written مُتَّهِمٌ.])
تِهَامَةُ a name of Mekkeh: (JK, K:) and [more
commonly] a certain land, (Msb, K,) well known,
(K,) commencing from Dhát 'Irk, (Msb, TA,)
towards Nejd, (Msb,) and extending to Mekkeh
and beyond it to the distance of two day's journeys
(Msb, TA) and more, then uniting with the
Ghowr, and extending to the sea: some say that
it adjoins the land of El-Yemen; and that Mekkeh
is of تِهَامَةُ اليَمَنِ: (Msb:) [F says that] J has
erred in terming it a بَلَد: (K:) [but by بلد, J
may mean both a city and a country or province:]
some say that its name is from تَهِمَ in the first of
the senses assigned to this verb above, because it
is low in relation to Nejd, so that its odour is
bad; and some, that it is from the same verb in
the sense explained in the second sentence, because
of its vehement heat: (Msb:) [it seems to have
تَهَائِمُ for a pl.:] see تَهَمٌ, in four places; and
التَّهْمَةُ.
تِهَامِىٌّ Of, or belonging to, Tihámeh; as also
↓ تَهَامٍ, (T, S, M, Msb, K, [in the CK, erroneously,
تَهامٌ,]) with fet-h, (Msb, K,) irregularly formed;
(M, Msb;) fem. تَهَامِيَةٌ; like رَبَاعٍ and رَبَاعِيَةٌ: (T,
Msb:) when it is pronounced with fet-h to the
ت, it is without teshdeed [to the ى when you say
التَّهَامِى and تَهَامِيَةٌ]; as in the instances of رَجُلٌ
يَمَانٍ and شَآمٍ, except that the ا in تَهَامٍ is of the
original word, and that in يَمَانٍ and شَآمٍ is a
substitute for the two ى of the [regular] rel. n.,
(S,) or rather, for one of those two ى: (Aboo-Zekereeyà, TA:) and you say قَوْمٌ تَهَامُونَ [A
people, or company of men, of Tihámeh], like
يَمَانُونَ: (S, K:) and accord. to Sb, some say
تَهَامِىٌّ and يَمَانِىٌّ and شَآمِىٌّ, with fet-h, and with
teshdeed [to the ى]. (S.)
مُتْهَمٌ: see تَهِيمٌ.

مَتَاهِيمُ (S, TA) and مَتَاهِمُ, (TA,) applied to men
(S, TA) and to camels. (TA.)
