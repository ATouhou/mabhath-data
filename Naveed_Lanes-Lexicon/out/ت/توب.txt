توب1
تَابَ, (T, A,) or تاب إِلَى اللّٰهِ, (S, M, K,) aor.
يَتُوبُ, (Msb,) inf. n. تَوْبَةٌ and تَوْبٌ, (T, S, M, Msb,
K,) both of these signifying the same, (T, S, M,
Msb,) the ة in the former being added to denote
the fem. gender, or, as some say, the former is a
n. un. like ضَرْبَةٌ, (Msb,) or, as Akh says, تَوْبٌ is
pl. [or a quasi-pl. n.] of تَوْبَةٌ, like as عَوْمٌ is of
عَوْمَةٌ, (S,) or like as لَوْزٌ is of لَوْزَةٌ, and this is the
opinion of Mbr, (M,) and تَابَةٌ, (M, K,) which is
for تَوْبَةٌ, (M,) and مَتَابٌ (S, M, A, K) and تَتْوِبَةٌ,
(S, * M, * K,) of the measure تَفْعِلَةٌ, (S, M,) an
anomalous form, (TA,) syn. with تَوْبَةٌ, mentioned
in the Book of Sb; (S;) [He repented; or repented toward God; as will be shown by what
follows:] originally, he returned unto God, (T,
TA,) مِنْ كَذَا and عَنْ كَذَا [from such a thing]:
(TA:) or he returned, [or returned unto God,]
(S, M, A, K,) from sin, (S,) or from his sin, (A,)
or from disobedience (M, K) to obedience: (M:)
or تَابَ مِنْ ذَنْبِهِ signifies he desisted from his sin:
(Msb:) تَوْبَةٌ signifies the repenting of sin; i. e.
the grieving for it, or regretting it, with the confession of having no excuse for the commission
thereof. (Kull.) It is said in a trad., النَّدَمُ تَوْبَةٌ
[Repentance is] a returning from sin. (S.) The
time of El-Islám is termed زَمَنُ التَّوْبَةِ as being
The time of returning from [or repenting of] the
belief in a plurality of gods. (A.) A poet says,
تُبْتُ إِلَيْكَ فَتَقَبَّلْ تَابَتِى
وَصُمْتُ رَبِّى فَتَفَبَّلْ صَامَتِى
[I have repented toward Thee, and accept Thou
my repentance; and I have fasted, O my Lord,
and accept Thou my fast]; meaning تَوْبَتِى and
صَوْمَتِى. (M.) ―
-b2-  تَابَ اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ God returned to
forgiveness towards him; became again forgiving
to him: (T:) or disposed, or adapted, him to
repentance, or returning from sin or disobedience:
(S, K:) or reverted from severity to mildness
towards him: or returned to him with his favour,
or grace, and his acceptance, or approbation;
became again propitious to him: (A, K:) all
these meanings are correct: (TA:) or God forgave him, and saved him from acts of disobedience:
(Msb:) or accepted his repentance: (Jel in ii. 35
&c.:) or returned towards him with mercy, and
acceptance of repentance. (Bd ibid.)
10
استتابهُ He proposed to him that he should
return [to obedience unto God], (T, A,) and
repent of that which he had committed: (T:) he
asked him to return from sin, or disobedience:
(S, K:) or he asked him to desist from his sin.
(Msb.)
تَابُوتٌ, originally تَوَبُوتٌ, the ت not being the
characteristic of the fem. gender, (Z, MF, TA,) of
the measure فَعَلُوتٌ, and meaning A chest, or box,
from التَّوْبُ, because what is taken out from it
continually returns to it: (AAF, IJ, Z, MF, TA:)
or originally تَابُوَةٌ; (S, K; [in the CK تَأْبُوَةٌ;])
the و being made quiescent, and the ة changed
into ت: (S, K:) [in Chald. ?: in Hebr.
?:] it signifies also the ribs, with what they
contain, as the heart and the liver &c.; as being
likened to a chest, or box; (IAth, TA in art.
تبت;) the chest, breast, or bosom: (A in that
art.:) or [primarily] the ribs, with what they
contain, as the heart &c.: and [hence] applied to
a chest, or box: (Towsheeh, MF, TA:) also
written تَبُوتٌ. (K in art. تبت.) [It is generally
applied in the present day to a bier: a coffin:
and an oblong case that is placed over a grave:
the pl. is تَوَابِيتُ.] El-Kásim Ibn-Maan says that
it is the only word in the Kur-án in respect of
which the dialects of Kureysh and the Ansár
differ; the former pronouncing it تَابُوتٌ; (S;)
and the latter, تَابُوهٌ. (S, K.) But IB denies that
its last letter is originally ة, the fem. termination;
asserting the final ت to be a radical letter, the
measure of the word to be فَاعُولٌ, and its proper
place in art. تبت: he says that the final ت is
changed in a case of pause, but not generally, into
ه, as is that of الفُرَات [the Euphrates], in which
the ت is not the fem. termination. (L, TA.) You
say, مَا أَوْدَعْتُ تَابُوتِى شَيْئًا فَقَدْتُهُ, meaning I have
not deposited in my bosom anything of knowledge,
or science, that I have lost. (A in art. تبت.)
تَوَّابٌ, applied to a man, [One who repents much
or often;] returning from disobedience to obedience
[to God] (M, K, TA) much or often. (TA.) ―
-b2-
And applied to God, One who returns [much or
often] to forgiveness towards his servant who
returns unto Him: (T:) or who [often] disposes,
or adapts, to repentance, or returning from sin or
disobedience; or reverts from severity to mildness;
or returns with his favour or grace, &c.: (A, K:
[see 1, last sentence:]) or who forgives much, and
save from acts of disobedience. (Msb.)
تَائِبٌ [Repenting of sin: (see 1:) originally,]
returning from disobedience (M, K) to obedience
to God. (M.)
