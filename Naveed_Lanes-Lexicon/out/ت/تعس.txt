تعس1
تَعَسَ, aor.
تَعَسَ, inf. n. تَعْسٌ; (S, A, Msb, K,
&c.;) and تَعسَ, aor.
تَعَسَ; (Sh, AHeyth, A, IAth,
K;) but the latter is not chaste; (A, TA;) or
the former is used in addressing a person, saying
تَعَسْتَ; and the latter, in narration; (K;) accord.
to Sh; but ISd says that this is strange; (TA;)
He fell, having stumbled; contr. of اِنْتَعَشَ: this
is the primary signification: (S:) or he stumbled
and fell (AHeyth, A, IAth, K) upon his hands
and mouth, (AHeyth, TA,) or upon his face:
(IAth, TA:) or he fell upon his face: (Er-Rustamee, Msb, TA:) [and this may also be
meant by one of the explanations of the inf. n.
in the TA, which is نُكْسٌ فِى سَفَالٍ:] or he fell
in any manner. (TA.) You say, by way of
imprecation, تَعَسَ وَانْتَكَسَ, meaning May he
fall upon his face, and not rise after his fall
until he fall a second time. (Msb.) And تَعَسَ
فَمَا انْتَعَشَ وَشِيكَ فَلَا انْتَقَشَ [May he fall, having
stumbled, or stumble and fall, &c., and not rise
again; and may he be pricked with a thorn, and
not extract the thorn]. (TA.) And accord. to
certain of the Kilábees, تَعَسَ signifies He missed
his proof in litigation, and the object of his search
in seeking. (TA.) ―
-b2-  He perished. (Aboo-'Amr
Ibn-El-'Alà, S, K.) You say, تَعَسْتَ, as though
meaning Mayest thou perish. (ISh, TA.) ―
-b3-
He became far removed. (A, K.) ―
-b4-  He became
lowered, or degraded. (A, K.) You say also,
تَعَسَ جَدُّهُ [His fortune, or good fortune, fell:
or may his fortune, or good fortune, fall]. (K
in art. عثر.)
-A2-  تَعَسَهُ اللّٰهُ, [aor.
تَعَسَ, inf. n. تَعْسٌ;]
(A'Obeyd, A, Msb, K;) and ↓ اتعسهُ; (AHeyth,
S, A, Msb, K;) the former unknown to Sb; (Az,
TA;) God made him to fall, having stumbled:
(S:) or to stumble and fall (AHeyth, A, K) upon
his hands and mouth, (AHeyth, TA,) or upon his
face: (TA:) or to fall upon his face: (Msb:)
or to fall in any manner. (TA.) ―
-b2-  God destroyed him; or made him to perish. (A'Obeyd,
S, K.) ―
-b3-  God made him to become far removed.
(A, K.) ―
-b4-  God lowered, or degraded, him. (A,
K.) ―
-b5-  You say, by way of imprecation, تَعْسًا لَهُ
May he [fall, having stumbled: or, stumble and
fall: or, stumble and fall upon his hands and
mouth: or, upon his face: or] fall upon his face:
(Msb:) or may God make destruction to cleave
to him: (S, TA:) [or may God destroy him.]
Aboo-Is-hák says, in explanation of the phrase
فَتَعْسًا لَهُمْ, in the Kur xlvii. 9, that it may be in
the accus. case as meaning اللّٰهُ ↓ أَتْعَسَهُمُ. (TA.)
A man also says, by way of imprecation, to his
swift and excellent camel, when it stumbles, تَعْسًا,
meaning May God throw thee down upon thy
nostrils: expressing his disapproval of the stumbling of a beast of such age and strength: but if
it be not a swift and excellent beast, and stumble,
he says to it لَعًا. (TA.) You say also, اللّٰهُ ↓ أَتْعَسَ
جَدَّهُ [May God make his fortune, or good fortune,
to sink!] (A.)
