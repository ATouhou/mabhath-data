تاتَا fem. of ذَا; (M;) i. q. ذِهْ [This and that];
(T;) a noun of indication, denoting that which is
female or feminine; like ذَا (S, K) applied to that
which is male or masculine; (S;) and you say
also تِهْ, like ذِهْ: (S, K:) the dual is تَانِ: and
the pl., أُولَآءِ. (S, K.) En-Nábighah [Edh-Dhubyánee] says, (T, S,) excusing himself to En-Noamán [Aboo-Káboos], whom he had satirized,
(TA,)
هَا إِنَّ تَا عِذْرَةٌ إِنْ لَمْ تَكُنْ نَفَعَتْ
فَإِنَّ صَاحِبَهَا قَدْ تَاهَ فِى البَلَدِ
[Now verily this is an excuse: if it profit not,
then verily its author has lost his way in the
desert, or in the waterless desert]: (T, S: but in
the latter, لا is put in the place of لم:) تا here
points to the قَصِيدَة [or ode]; and عذرة is a subst
from اِعْتِذَارٌ; and تاه means تَحَيَّرَ; and البلد
means المَفَازَة. (TA.) The dim. of تَا is تَيَّا, (T,
S, M, K,) which is anomalous, like ذَيَّا the dim.
of ذَا, &c. (I'Ak p. 343. [Much has been written
respecting the formation of this dim. to reduce
it to something like rule, but I pass it over as,
in my opinion, unprofitable and unsatisfactory;
and only refer to what is said respecting the
duals أُلَيَّا and أُلَيَّآءِ in art. الى. See an ex. voce
مِرَّةٌ.] ―
-b2-  هَا is prefixed to it (T, S, K) [as an inceptive particle] to give notice of what is about to
be said, (S,) so that one says هَاتَا [meaning This],
(T, S, K,) as in هَاتَا فُلَانَةُ [This is such a woman];
(T;) and [in the dual] هَاتَانِ; and [in the pl.]
هٰؤُلَآءِ: and the dim. is هَاتَيَّا. (S.) ―
-b3-  When you
use it in addressing another person, you add to
it ك [as a particle of allocution], and say تَاكَ (S,
K) and تِيكَ and تِلْكَ (T, S, K) and تَلْكَ, which
is a bad dial. var., (S, K,) and تَالِكَ, (T, S,) which
is the worst of these: (T:) [all meaning That:]
the dual is تَانِكَ and تَانِّكَ, the latter with tesh-deed, (S, K, [but in some copies of the S, only
the latter is mentioned,]) and تَالِكَ [which, like
تَانِّكَ, is dual of تِلْكَ or تَلْكَ, which are contractions of تَالِكَ; these two duals being for تَانِلِكَ,
the original, but unused, form]: (K:) the pl. is
أُولٰئِكَ [or أُولَآئِكَ] and أُولَاكَ and أُولَالِكَ [respecting all of which see أُلَى, in art. الى]: (S, K:)
and the dim. is تَيَّاكَ and تَيَّالِكَ: (K: [in the TA,
the latter is erroneously written تَيّانِكَ:]) the ك
relates to the person or persons whom you address,
masc. and fem. and dual and pl.: [but in addressing a female, you may say تَاكِ &c.; in addressing
two persons, تَاكُمَا &c.; in addressing more than
two males, تَاكُمْ &c.; and in addressing more
than two females, تَاكُنَّ &c.:] what precedes the
ك relates to the person [or thing] indicated, masc.
and fem. and dual and pl. (S.) ―
-b4-  هَا is also
prefixed to تِيكَ and تَاكَ, so that one says, هَاتِيكَ
هِنْدُ and هَاتَاكَ هِنْدُ [This, or that, is Hind]. (S,
K. *) Abu-n-Nejm says,
جِئْنَا نُحَيِّيكَ وَنَسْتَجْدِيكَا
فَافْعَلْ بِنَا هَاتَاكَ أَوْ هَاتِيكَا
meaning [We have come saluting thee and seeking
of thee a gift: then do thou to us] this or that:
[give us] a salutation or a gift. (S.) The هَا that
is used to give notice of what is about to be said
is not prefixed to تلك because the ل is made a
substitute for that ها: (S, TA:) or, as IB says,
they do not prefix that ها to ذٰلِكَ and تِلْكَ because
the ل denotes the remoteness of that which is
indicated and the ها denotes its nearness, so that
the two are incompatible. (TA.)
