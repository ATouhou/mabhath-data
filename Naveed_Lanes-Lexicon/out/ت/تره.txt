تَرِهَ, aor.
تَرَهَ, He fell into what are termed
تُرَّهَات, said to signify, originally, [deserts, such as
are termed] قِفَار, and to be metaphorically applied
to (tropical:)  false, or vain, sayings or actions or affairs;
unprofitable sayings: (K, * TA:) or (assumed tropical:)  he uttered
false and confused and vain speech, with somewhat of embellishment, (Lth, TA,) or without
foundation, or order, or method. (Akh, TA.)
تُرَّهٌ: see what next follows, in two places.
تُرَّهَةٌ A small road branching off from a main
road: (As, S, K:) a Persian word, arabicized:
(As, S:) pl. تُرَّهَاتٌ (As, S, K) and تُرُّهَاتٌ. (TA.)
―
-b2-  A [desert, such as is termed قَفْرٌ, (see 1,) or]
مَفَازَةٌ, and صَحْرَآءُ. (JK.) ―
-b3-  The first in this
paragraph is the primary signification: (TA:)
and hence, metaphorically, (As, S,) (tropical:)  A false, or
vain, saying or action or affair; (As, JK, S K;)
as also ↓ تُرَّهٌ: (S, K:) pl. of the former, تُرَّهَاتٌ
(JK, S, K *) [and تُرُّهَاتٌ, as above]; and of the
latter, تَرَارِيَهُ: (S, K: *) or the primary signification of تُرَّهَاتٌ is قِفَارٌ: [see 1:] and it is metaphorically applied to (tropical:)  false, or vain, sayings or
actions or affairs; (K;) and unprofitable sayings:
(Z, K, TA:) or, accord. to Az, false, or vain,
affairs: and the sing. is ↓ تُرَّهٌ: or, accord. to IB,
this last is pl. of تُرَّهَةٌ: [or rather a coll. gen. n.:]
or, as some say, it is a sing.: (TA:) and accord.
to Lth it signifies the act of lying, and confusing
[truth and falsehood]. (Har p. 165.) [Sometimes
it is followed by a syn., to give greater force to
the signification:] one says التُرَّهَاتُ البَسَابِسُ and
التُرَّهَاتُ الصَّحَاصِحُ: and sometimes the former
word is used as a prefixed noun governing the
gen. case [so that one says تُرَّهَاتُ البَسَابِسُ and
ترّهاتُ الصَّحَاصِحِ: الصَّحْصَحُ is mentioned in the
K, in this art., as a syn. of التُّرَّهَةُ]. (S.) ―
