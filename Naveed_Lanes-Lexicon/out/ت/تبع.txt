تَبِعَهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K, &c.,) aor.
تَبَعَ, inf. n.
تَبَعٌ (S, Msb, K) and تَبَاعَةٌ, (S, K,) He followed;
or went, or walked, behind, or after; (S, Mgh,
Msb, K;) him, (Mgh, Msb, K,) or it; namely,
a people, or company of men: (S:) or [in the
CK “ and ”] he went with him, or it, when the
latter had passed by him: (S, Mgh, Msb, K:) and
↓ اِتَّبَعَهُ signifies the same; (Lth, S, K *) and so
does ↓ أَتْبَعَهُ: (Lth, Mgh, K:) or ↓ أَتْبَعْتُهُمْ signifies
I overtook them, they having gone before me;
(Fr, * A'Obeyd, S, Msb, * K;) as also تَبِعْتُهُمْ: (Fr,
K:) Akh says that تَبِعْتُهُ and ↓ أَتْبَعْتُهُ signify the
same: and hence the saying in the Kur [xxxvii. 10],
شِهَابٌ ثَاقِبٌ ↓ فَأَتْبَعَهُ [and a shooting star piercing
the darkness by its light overtaketh him]: (S:)
and the saying in the same [vii. 174], ↓ فَأَتْبَعَهُ
الشَّيْطَانُ and the devil overtook him: (TA:) and
the saying in the same [xx. 81], فِرْعَوْنُ ↓ فَأَتْبَعَهُمْ
بِجُنُودِهِ and Pharaoh overtook them with his
troops: or almost did so: (Ibn-'Arafeh, K:) or
this signifies made his troops to follow them;
(TA;) the ب, accord. to some, being redundant:
(Bd:) or ↓ أَتْبَعَهُ signifies he followed his footsteps;
and sought him, following him: (TA:) but ↓ اِتَّبَعَهُمْ
signifies he went [after them, or followed them,]
when they had passed by him; as also تَبِعَهُمْ,
inf. n. تَبَعٌ: you say, ↓ حَتَّى أَتْبَعْتُهُمْ ↓ مَا زِلْتُ أَتَّبِعُهُمْ,
i. e. [I ceased not to follow them] until I overtook
them: (A'Obeyd:) Fr says that ↓ أَتْبَعَ is better
than ↓ اِتَّبَعَ; for the latter signifies he went behind,
or after, him, when the latter person was going
along; but when you say, ↓ أَتْبَعْتُهُ, it is as though
[you meant that] you followed his footsteps:
(TA:) and ↓ فُلَانٌ فُلَانًا ↓ اِتَّبَعَ [as in the L and
TA, but perhaps a mistake for ↓ أَتْبَعَ,] signifies
also he followed him, desiring to do evil to him;
like as Pharaoh followed Moses: (L, TA:) some
say, تَبِعْتُ الشَّىْءَ, inf. n. تُبُوعٌ, meaning I went
after the thing: and تَبِعَ الشَّىْءَ, inf. n. تَبَعٌ and
تَبَاعٌ, (assumed tropical:)  [he followed the thing] in respect of actions:
(L, TA:) you say, تَبِعَ الإِمَامَ (assumed tropical:)  he followed the
Imám [by doing as he did]: (Msb:) [but in this
last sense, more commonly,] one says, ↓ اِتَّبَعَهُ,
meaning (assumed tropical:)  he did like as he [another] did: (TA:)
and القُرْآنَ ↓ اِتَّبَعَ (assumed tropical:)  he followed the Kurán as his
guide; did according to what is in it: (TA:)
and you say also, عَلَى الأَمْرِ ↓ تَابَعَهُ; (Msb;) or
على كَذَا, inf. n. مُتَابَعَةٌ and تِبَاعٌ; (S;) (assumed tropical:)  [he
followed him, or imitated him, in the affair;]
(Msb;) he followed him, or imitated him, in
doing such a thing: (PS:) [but this last phrase
has another meaning: see 3.] In the saying,
لَا يُتْبَعُ بِنَارٍ إِلَى القَبْرِ, [in which the verb may be
pass. of تَبِعَ or of ↓ أَتْبَعَ,] or, accord. to one relation, ↓ لا يُتَّبَعُ, each in the pass. form, [Fire shall
not be made to follow to the grave, though it may
be rendered one shall not follow with fire to the
grave, it is said that] the ب is to render the verb
transitive. (Mgh.) ―
-b2-  تَبِعْتُ الرَّجُلَ بِحَقِّى; and
بِهِ ↓ تَابَعْتُهُ, inf. n. مُتَابَعَةٌ [and probably تبَاعٌ also];
and به ↓ اِتَّبَعْتُهُ; I prosecuted, or sued, the man
for my right, or due. (TA.) The saying in the
Kur [ii. 173], بِالْمَعْرُوفِ ↓ فَاتِّبَاعٌ means [Then]
prosecution for the bloodwit [shall be made with
lenity]. (TA.) ―
-b3-  تَبِعَ, of which the aor., يَتْبَع,
occurs in a trad., [see 4,] (Mgh, TA,) pronounced
by the relaters of trads. with teshdeed, [↓ يَتَّبِع,]
(TA,) also signifies (assumed tropical:)  He accepted a reference
from his debtor to another for the payment of
what was owed to him. (Mgh, TA. *)

تَبَّعَ اللّٰهُ لِفُلَانٍ, inf. n. تَتْبِيعٌ, May God make
a thing to be followed by another thing to such a
one, is said in relation to good and to evil; like

وِلَآءٌ [The making a consecution, or succession, of
one to the other, بَيْنَ أَمْرَيْنِ between two things,
or affairs: and the making consecutive, successive,

in a trad., تَابِعُوا بَيْنَ الحَجِّ والعُمْرَةِ [Make ye a
consecution between the حجّ and the عمرة; meaning make ye the performance of the حجّ and that
of the عمرة to be consecutive]; (TA;) i. e. when
ye perform the حجّ, then perform ye the عمرة;
and when ye perform the عمرة, then perform ye
the حجّ: or when ye perform either of these, then
perform ye after it the other, without any length
of time [intervening]: but the former [meaning]
is the more obvious. (Marginal note in a copy of
the Jámi'-es-Sagheer of Es-Suyootee.) And you
say, تَابِعْ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَهُمْ عَلَى الخَيْرَاتِ (assumed tropical:)  Make thou us

He pared, or trimmed, the bow well, giving to

Skr says that the phrase تُوبِعَ بَرْيُهَا, used by Aboo-Kebeer El-Hudhalee in describing a bow, means
The paring, or trimming, of which has been executed with uniformity, part after part. (TA.)
―
-b3-  Hence, (TA,) the saying of Abu-l-Wákid ElLeythee, (S, TA,) in a trad., (S,) تَابَعْنَا الأَعْمَالَ
فَلَمْ نَجِدْ شَيْئًا أَبْلَغَ فِى طَلَبِ الآخِرَةِ مِنَ الزُّهْدِ فِى
الدُّنْيَا (S, TA) (assumed tropical:)  We have practised works with
diligence, and acquired a sound knowledge of
them, [and we have not found anything more

say also, تابع عَمَلَهُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  He made his work

manner, كَلَامَهُ his language, or speech. (Kr.)

-A2-  Also He made him to follow; or to
overtake: (S, K:) he made him to be a follower:
(Mgh, Msb:) or he urged him, or induced him,
to be a follower. (Mgh.) You say, [making the
verb doubly trans.,] أَتْبَعْتُهُمْ غَيْرِى [I made them to
follow, or overtake, another, not myself]. (K.) And
أَتْبَعْتُهُ الشَّىْءَ فَتَبِعَهُ [I made him to follow, or overtake, the thing, and he followed it, or overtook

to follow the horse]: or النَّاقَةَ زِمَامَهَا [her nose-rein,
the she-camel]: or الدَّلْوَ رِشَآءَهَا [its rope, the
bucket]: used in bidding to complete a favour, or
benefaction: (K, TA:) A'Obeyd says, I think the
meaning of the first prov. to be, Thou hast liberally given the horse, and the bit and bridle are a
smaller matter; therefore satisfy thou completely
the want, seeing that the horse is not without
need of the bit and bridle. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Hence the
trad., مَنْ أُتْبِعَ عَلَى مَلِىْءٍ فَلْيَتْبَعْ (tropical:)  Whoso is
referred, for the payment of what is owed to him,
to a solvent man, let him accept the reference:
(Mgh, TA: *) [see also 1, last meaning:] the verb

تَبِعَةٌ and ↓ تِبَاعَةٌ signify the same; (T, S, O, L,
K;) [The consequence of an action: and] a claim
which one seeks to obtain for an injury, or injurious treatment, and the like: (T, O, L, K; and
so the Msb in explanation of the former word:)
the former is also explained as signifying a right,
or due, annexed to property, claimed from the
possessor of the property: (L:) pl. [of the former]
تَبِعَاتٌ and [of the latter] تِبَاعَاتٌ. (TA.) A poet
says,

↓ سُوْءَ العَوَاقِبِ وَالتِّبَاعَهْ  لَمْ يَحْذَرُوا مِنْ رَبِّهِمْ
[Haneefeh ate their lord, in the time of experiencing dearth, or drought, or sterility, and
hunger: they did not fear, from their lord, the
evil of the results, and the consequence of their
action]: for they had taken to themselves a god
consisting of حَيْس, [i. e. dates mixed with clarified
butter and the preparation of milk called أَقِط,
kneaded together,] and worshipped it for some
time; then famine befell them, and they ate it.

(TA:) or that is a year old; (Az, Mgh, TA;) not
so called until he has completed the year; erroneously said by Lth to signify a calf ripening to
his perfect state: (Az, TA:) thus called because
he yet follows his mother; (Mgh, Msb;) the word
in this sense being of the measure فَعِيلٌ in the
sense of the measure فَاعِلٌ: (Msb:) and ↓ تِبْعٌ
signifies the same: (TA:) fem. of the former
with ة: (S, Msb, K:) pl. تِبَاعٌ and تَبَائِعٌ; (AA,
S, O, K;) both pls. of تَبِيعٌ; (AA, S, O;) or the
former is pl. of تَبِيعَةٌ; (Msb;) and the pl. of

-b2-  I. q. ↓ تَابِعٌ [as signifying One
who prosecutes, or sues, for a right, or due; and
particularly for blood-revenge]. (S, K.) Hence
the saying in the Kur [xvii. 71], ثُمَّ لَا تَجِدُوا لَكُمْ
عَلَيْنَا بِهِ تَبِيعًا Then ye shall not find for you any
to prosecute for blood-revenge, nor any to sue,
against us therein: (Fr. S, K:) or ye shall not
find for you any to sue us for the disallowing of
what hath befallen you, nor for our averting it
from you: (Zj:) [or any aider against us; for]
تَبِيعٌ also signifies an aider; and especially against
an enemy. (Lth, K.) ―

because they followed one another; whenever one
died, another took his place, following him in his
course of acting: (TA:) pl. تَبَابِعَةٌ, (S, K,) with
ة added as having the meaning of a rel. n.; [as
though it were pl. of تُبَّعِىٌّ, like as حَنَابِلَةٌ is pl.
of حَنْبَلِىٌّ;] erroneously written in some of the
copies of the K تتابعة: (TA:) the تبابعة of
Himyer were like the أَكَاسِرَة of the Persians and
the قَيَاصِرَة of the Romans. (Lth.) In the Kur
xliv. 36, it is said in a trad. to mean a particular
king, who was a believer, and whose people were
unbelievers. (Zj.) ―

(S) [He comes to the waters when people are
dwelling, or staying, there, (but see حَضِيرَةٌ,) and
when no one is there, as the bird called katáh
comes to water] when the shade has become contracted at mid-day: or, accord. to Aboo-Leylà,
the meaning is, the shade of night; i. e., this man
comes to the waters in the last part of the night,
before any one: though it means also the shade of
day-time: (TA:) or, accord. to Aboo-Sa'eed Ed-
Dareer, the meaning here is [the star, or asterism,
called] الدَّبَرَان; and this is very probably correct;
for the bird above mentioned comes to the waters by
night, and seldom by day; and hence the saying,
أَدَلُّ مِنْ قَطَاةٍ. (Az, TA.) See تَابِعٌ. ―

الصَّبَا, unaccompanied by rising clouds, (TA,) and
veers round through the various places whence
winds blow until it returns to the place from
which blows the wind called الصبا, (K, TA,) whence
it commenced in the early morning: (TA:) the
Arabs dislike it. (Z, TA.)
تَابِعٌ Following; a follower: (TA:) and ↓ تَبَعٌ
also signifies the same as تَابِعٌ; (K;) a thing
that follows in the track of a thing; (Lth, Az;)
or that is at the kinder, or latter, part of anything; (TA;) but is used alike as sing. and pl.:

[and, applied to rational beings, تَابِعُونَ]: and the
pl. of ↓ تَبَعٌ is أَتْبَاعٌ; (S, K;) or this may be used
as a pl. of تَبَعٌ; (Msb;) or it is pl. of تَابِعٌ, like
as خَدَمٌ is pl. of خَادِمٌ, (Kr, Mgh,) and طَلَبٌ of
طَالِبٌ, &c.; (K;) or, correctly speaking, it is a
quasi-pl. n. (Sb, TA.) You say, ↓ المُصَلِّى تَبَعٌ
لاِمَامِهِ [The person praying is a follower of his
Imám]: and النَّاسُ تَبَعٌ لَهُ [The people are followers
of him]. (Msb.) And it is said in the Kur
[xiv. 24, and xl. 50], ↓ إِنَّا كُنَّا لَكُمْ تَبَعًا [Verily
we were followers of you]: (S, TA:) in which
the last word may be a quasi-pl. n. of تَابِعٌ; or it
may be an inf. n., meaning ذَوِى تَبَعٍ. (TA.)
↓ تَبَعٌ is applied as an epithet to the legs of a
beast: (Lth, T:) and is also used as [an epithet
in which the quality of a subst. is predominant,]
signifying The legs of a beast. (K.) ―
-b2-  A jinnee,
or genie, that accompanies a woman and follows
her whithersoever she goes, (K, TA,) loving her:
(TA:) and تَابِعَةٌ a jinneeyeh, or female genie,
that does the same to a man: (S, * K, TA:) or
the ة is added in the latter to give intensiveness
to the signification, or to denote evilness of nature,
or to convey the meaning of دَاهِيَةٌ, q. v.: the pl.
is تَوَابِعُ: and this means female associates. (TA.)
―
-b3-  A servant; as also ↓ تَبِيعٌ. (TA.) أَوِ التَّابِعِينَ
