تalphabetical letter
ت
The third letter of the alphabet: called تَآءٌ and تَا
[respecting which latter see the letter ب]: the
pl. [of the former is تَآءَاتٌ; and of the latter,]
أَتْوَآءُ. (TA in باب الالف الليِنّة.) It is one of the
letters termed مَهْمُوسَة [or non-vocal, i. e. pronounced with the breath only, without the voice],
and of those termed نِطَعِيَّة [and نِطْعِيَّة and نَطَعِيَّة
and نَطْعِيَّة pronounced by pressing the tip of the
tongue against the upper gums and suddenly withdrawing it with an emission of the breath]: these
latter are ط and د and ت, three letters that are
among those which are changed into other letters.
(TA at the commencement of باب التآء.)
-A2-  It is
one of the augmentative letters: (S:) and is
movent when added at the beginning of a noun,
and at the end of a noun, [and at the beginning
of a verb,] and at the end of a verb, and is also
quiescent at the end of a verb. (Mughnee, K.)
-A3-  Added at the beginning of a noun, it is a preposition, or particle governing the gen. case, significant of swearing, (S, * Mughnee, K,) and
denoting wonder; (Mughnee, K;) and [accord.
to general usage] it is peculiarly prefixed to the
name اللّٰه; (S, Mughnee, K;) as in تَاللّٰهِ لَقَدْ كَانَ
كَذَا [By God, verily it was thus, or verily such
a thing was]; (S;) and تَاللّٰهِ لَأَفْعَلَنَّ كَذَا [By
God, I will assuredly do such a thing]: (TA:)
but sometimes they said, تَرَبِّى [By my Lord],
and تَرَبِّ الكَعْبَةِ [By the Lord of the Kaabeh],
and تَالرَّحْمَانِ [By the Compassionate], (Mughnee, K,) as is related on the authority of Akh;
deviating from common usage. (TA.) Thus used,
it is a substitute for و, (S, Mughnee,) as it is also
in تَتْرَى and تُرَاثٌ and تُجَاهَ and تُخَمَةٌ [&c.];
(S;) and the و is a substitute for ب; (S, Mughnee;) but the ت has the additional meaning of
denoting wonder: so says Z. (Mughnee.)
-A4-
Added at the end of a noun, it is a particle of
allocution: (Mughnee, K:) it is thus added in
أَنْتَ [Thou], (S, Mughnee, K,) addressed to a
male, (TA,) and أَنْتِ [Thou], (Mughnee, K,)
addressed to a female; (TA;) uniting with the
noun, as though the two became one; not being
an affixed noun governed in the gen. case. (S.
[See أَنْ.])
-A5-  It is added in [the beginning
of] the second person of the future, (S,) [i. e.,]
in the beginning of the aor., (TA,) [as a particle
of allocution,] as in أَنْتَ تَفْعَلُ [Thou dost, or wilt
do]. (S, TA.) ―
-b2-  It is also added, as a sign of
the fem. gender, in the beginning of the future,
[or aor.,] as in هِىَ تَفْعَلُ [She does, or will do]. (S,
TA.) ―
-b3-  It is also added in the beginning of the
third person [fem.] of the [aor. used as an] imperative, [as a sign of the fem. gender,] as in لِتَقُمْ هِنْدُ
[Let Hind stand]. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And sometimes it
is added in the beginning of the second person
of the [aor. used as an] imperative, [as a particle
of allocution,] as in the phrase in the Kur [x. 59,
accord. to one reading], فَبِذٰلِكَ فَلْتَفْرَحُوا [Therefore therein rejoice ye]: and in the saying of
the rájiz,
تِئْذَنْ فَإِنِّى حَمْؤُهَا وَجَارُهَا  قُلْتُ لِبَوَّابٍ لَدَيْهِ دَارُهَا
[explained in art.اذن]: and [thus] it is added in
the beginning of [the second person of] the [aor.
used as an] imperative of a verb of which the
agent is not named, as in لِتُزْهَ يَا رَجُلُ [Be thou
proud, vain, boastful, or self-conceited, O man],
from زُهِىَ: but Akh says that the adding of the
ل in the beginning of the second person of the
[aor. used as an] imperative [except in the case
of a pass. verb or a verb of which the agent is
not named] is a bad idiom, because the ل is not
needed. (S, TA.)
-A6-  The movent ت added at
the end of a verb is a pronoun, as in قُمْتُ [I
stood], (Mughnee, K,) and قُمْتَ [Thou stoodest,
addressed to a male], and قُمْتِ [Thou stoodest,
addressed to a female]: (Mughnee:) thus added
in the first and second persons of the pret., it is a
pronoun denoting the agent. (S.) ―
-b2-  The quiescent ت added at the end of a verb is a sign of the
fem. gender, (Mughnee, K,) i. e., a particle applied
to denote the fem. gender, (Mughnee,) as in قَامَتْ
[She stood]. (Mughnee, K.) J says [in the S]
that, when thus added at the end of the pret., it
is a pronoun: but IB says [correctly] that it is
a particle. (TA.)
-A7-  It is also, sometimes, affixed
to ثُمَّ and رُبَّ; and in these cases it is most
commonly movent with fet-h, (Mughnee, K,) so
that one says ثُمَّتَ and رُبَّتَ. (TA.) [See arts.
ثم and رب.]
-A8-  تِ is an imperative of أَتَى. (M
in art. اتى.)
-A9-  [As a numeral, ت denotes Four
hundred.]
