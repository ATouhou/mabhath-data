تيس1
تَاسَ, [aor. يَتِيسُ,] He (a kid) became a تَيْس.
(M, TA.) ―
-b2-  [Also, app., (tropical:)  He became like a hegoat in stupidity: for what immediately follows
appears to be the fem. of the imp. of this verb.]
↓ تِيسِى is a word used in declaring a thing to be
vain, and false: (M, K:) or it is an execration;
[for لُعْبَةٌ, an evident mistake, which I find in
copies of the K, and in the TA, I read لَعْنَةٌ;] and
a reproach: (K:) the vulgar say تِيزِى, changing
the س into ز. (TA.) One says to a she-hyena,
تِيسِى جَعَارِ, (A, * K,) meaning (tropical:)  Be thou like the
he-goat (تَيْس) in stupidity, O she-hyena: and
these words are a proverb applied to a stupid
man. (A, TA.) The same words were directed,
by Aboo-Eiyoob, as is related in a trad., to be
said to a غُول, (M, TA,) as though one said to her,
Thou liest, or hast lied, O girl. (TA,) And one
says to a man, تِيسِى, and اِحْمَقِى, [as though he
were a she-hyena, or a woman,] when he speaks
foolishly, or stupidly, or says what is not like
anything. (AZ, TA.)
3
تايس قِرْنَهُ, (A,) inf. n. مُتَايَسَةٌ and تِيَاسٌ, (A,
K,) (tropical:)  He strove, struggled, contended, or conflicted,
with his adversary; syn. مَارَسَهُ: (A:) [he strove
with his adversary to repel him, like as a he-goat
strives with another:] the inf. n. signifies the same
as مُمَارَسَةٌ, and مُكَابَسَةٌ, and مُدَافَعَةٌ. (K.)
6
تتايس المَآءُ (tropical:)  The waves of the water conflicted, or dashed together. (A, TA.)
10
اِسْتَتْيَسَتِ العَنْزُ (tropical:)  The she-goat became like
the تَيْس [or he-goat]: (M, [but in a copy of that
work, for العَنْزُ I find الشَّاةُ,] A, K:) like اِسْتَنْوَقَ
الجَمَلُ: (S:) a prov. applied to a vile man who
becomes mighty, (A,) or who magnifies himself:
(K:) one should not say استتاست. (Th, M, TA.)
تَيْسٌ A he-goat; the male of the مَعْز: (S,* M,
A, K:) and the male of the mountain-goat: (A,
K) and of the gazelle: (S, M, A, K:) the female
of the last [as well as of the first and second] is
called عَنْزٌ: (S, M:) or that has completed a year:
(A, K:) or a yearling he-goat: before the year
it is called جَدْىBٌ: (AZ, * Msb, TA:) pl. (of pauc.,
M) أَتْيَاسٌ (S, M, K) and أَتْيُسٌ, (M, TA,) and (of
mult., M) تُيُوسٌ (S, M, Msb, K) and تِيَسَةٌ and
↓ مَتْيُوسَآءُ [like مَشْيُوخَآءُ, q. v.]: (K:) the last
[which is properly a quasi-pl. n.] signifies the
same as تُيُوسٌ, (S,) or a herd of تُيُوس. (M.) You
say of the نَكَّاح, [i. e. of him who marries often,
or the like,] بَنِى فُلَانٍ ↓ هُوَ مِنْ مُتْيُوسَآءِ (tropical:)  [lit. He
is of the he-goats of the sons of such a one]. (A,
TA.)
تَيَسٌ The quality, in a she-goat, of having horns
like those of the mountain-goat, (K, TA,) in
length. (TA.)
تِيسِى: see 1.
عَنْزٌ تَيْسَآءٌ A she-goat having long horns, (M,
A,) like the  تَيْس: (A:) or having horns like
those of the mountain-goat, (K, TA,) in length.
(TA.)
فِيهِ تَيْسِيَّةٌ [In him is goatishness]: some say
↓ تَيْسُوسِيَّةٌ, [in the TA تُيُوسِيَّةٌ, but the former, which
is found in the L as well as in the S and K, seems,
from what here follows, to be the right,] (S, L,
K,) and [in like manner, for كَيْفِيَّةٌ they say]
كَيْفُوفِيَّةٌ, but [ J says] I know not what is the
truth thereof: (S:) the former word is preferable.
(O, TA.)
تَيْسُوسِيَّةٌ: see تَيْسِيَّةٌ.
تَيَّاسٌ A possessor of  تُيُوس [or he-goats]: (M:)
or one who holds the تَيْس. (S, K: explained in
the former by الَّذِى يُمْسِكُ التَّيْسَ: and in like
manner in the latter, by مُمْسِكُهُ.)
مَتْيُوسَآءُ: see تَيْسٌ, in two places.
