تِلَادٌ, applied to مَال [i. e. property, consisting
of camels or the like], (T, S, M, &c.,) Old, or
long-possessed; as also ↓ تَالِدٌ and ↓ تَلِيدٌ, (Mgh,

↓ مُتْلَدٌ;]) (M, K; [written in a copy of the M
مُتَلّد;]) wherefore, [i. e. because of the meaning,]
Yaakoob judges that the ت is a substitute for و;
[as is said to be the case in the S;] but this is
not a valid decision; for, were it so, the word in
some of its variations would be reduced to its
original: (M:) or any old, or long-possessed,
property, (T, M, L,) consisting of animals &c.,
(M, L,) inherited from parents; (T, M, L;) as
also ↓ تَالِدٌ (T, L) and ↓ تَلِيدٌ and ↓ مُتْلَدٌ (T, M, L

(سُوَر) of the Kur-án, meaning (tropical:)  They are of
those which I acquired (or learned, L) long ago
from the Kur-án: (S, M, L:) thus saying, he
likened them to the property, or camels &c.,
called تِلَادٌ. (M, L.) ―
-b3-  [Az says,] I heard a man
of Mekkeh say, تِلَادِىبِمَكَّةَ, i. e. مِيلَادِى [app.
meaning My birth was in Mekkeh]. (T.)
تَلِيدٌ: see تِلَادٌ, in three places. ―
-b2-  Also That

and is carried away while young to the territory
of the Arabs: (Mgh:) or one who is born in a
foreign country, and then brought away while

مُوَلَّدٌ and مُوَلَّدَةٌ, [masc. and fem.,] meaning one
that is born at thine own abode, or home: (ISh,
T: [see also تِلَادٌ:]) or one who has parents
at thine own abode, or home; whereas مُوَلَّدٌ signifies one who has only one parent there: (Mgh,
from the Tekmileh [of the 'Eyn]:) the fem. is
with ة; (S;) signifying a female slave who is
born in a foreign country, and is carried away,
and grows up in the territory of the Arabs: (Kt,
T:) or a female slave whose father and family
and all her relations are in one country and who
is herself in another: (ISh, L in art. ولد:) or a
female slave born the property of a people with
whom are her parents: (L in art. ولد:) or a
female slave inherited by her owner; if born at
his own abode, or home, [of a mother already
belonging to him,] she is called وَلِيدَةٌ: (T, L:)
you say رَجُلٌ تَلِيدٌ; pl. تُلَدَآءُ: and اِمْرَأَةٌ تَلِيدٌ [and
تَلِيدَةٌ]; pl. تَلَائِدُ (Lh, M, L) and تُلُدٌ. (Lh, L.)
It is related in a trad. of Shureyh, that a man
purchased a female slave, and the two parties
made it a condition that she should be a مُوَلَّدَة;
but the purchaser found her to be a تَلِيدَة, and
therefore returned her: (S, Mgh:) a مُوَلَّدَة is
like a تِلَاد, i. e. born at thine own abode, or
home; (S;) or born in the territory of the Muslims. (Mgh.) ―

[Hence,] خُلُقٌ مُتْلَدٌ, (M, L, TA,) in the K, مُتَلَّدٌ,
said to be like مُعَظَّمٌ, but this is a mistake, (TA,)
[and in the CK, خَلْقٌ is erroneously put for خُلُقٌ,]

or quality. (M, L, K.) IAar cites as an ex. this
verse:
مَا ذَا رُزِينَا مِنْكِ أَمَّ مَعْبَدِ
مِنْ سَعَةِ الحِلْمِ وَ خُلْقٍ مُتْلَد
[app. meaning What has been experienced from
us, on thy part, Umm-Maabad, of largeness of
forbearance, and of long-possessed good natural
dispositions, or qualities? رُزِينَا seems to be here
used for رُزِئْنَا; or the latter may be the correct
reading]. (M, L.)
مُتْلِدٌ [act. part. n. of 4:] A possessor of property such as is termed تِلَاد: and hence, ―
-b2-  A
first owner or proprietor; as the weaver of a
