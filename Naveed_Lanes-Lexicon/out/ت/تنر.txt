تنرتَنَّارٌ [and ↓ تَنُّورِىٌّ] A maker of ovens of the kind
called تَنُّور. (M, K.)
تَنُّورٌ A sort of كَانُون [or fire-place]; (M;)
the thing, (S, Msb,) or كانون, (K,) in which
bread is baked; (S, Msb, K;) but different from
the فُرْن: (S in art. فرن:) [it is a kind of oven,
open at the top, in the bottom of which a fire is
lighted, and in which the bread, in the form of
flat cakes, is generally stuck against the sides;
either portable, and made of baked clay, wide at
the bottom, and narrow at the top, where it is
open; and if so, the bread is sometimes stuck
upon the outside, to bake; or fixed, and in this
case made of baked clay likewise, or constructed
of bricks; or it is a hole made in the ground, and
lined with bricks or tiles or the like, against which
the bread is stuck, to bake; and sometimes flesh-meat, cut into small pieces, is roasted in it, or
upon it, on skewers:] such, accord. to some, is the
meaning in the Kur xi. 42 and xxiii. 27; (T;)
and the word is said to have the same meaning
in every language; (Lth, T, M;) but this is
not correct: (Ham p. 793:) it is an arabicized
word; (T, M;) not genuine Arabic; (AHát,
Msb;) originally Persian: (M:) [in Hebrew
XXX:] Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà [i. e. Th, as is stated
in Ham, ubi suprà,] says that it is of the measure
تَفْعُولٌ from النَّار, (M, and Ham ubi suprà,) or
from النُّور; originally تَنْوُورٌ; (Ham;) but this is
wrong: (M:) the pl. is تَنَانِيرُ. (M, Msb.) Mo-
hammad is related to have said to a man wearing
a garment dyed with bastard-saffron, “If thy
garment were in the تنّور of thy family, or beneath
their cooking-pot, it were better: ” whereupon he
went away, and burned it: but he meant, “Wert
thou to spend its price for flour to make bread,
or for fire-wood with which to cook, it were better
for thee: ” as though he disliked a garment so
dyed. (IAth.) ―
-b2-  The surface of the ground:
(T, S, M, K:) so in the Kur ubi suprà, (T, S,)
accord. to 'Alee (S) and I'Ab. (TA.) ―
-b3-  The
highest part of the earth or ground: so in the same
passages of the Kur accord. to Katádeh. (TA.) ―
-b4-
Any place from which water pours forth. (M, K.)
―
-b5-  A place where the water of a valley collects.
(M, K.) ―
-b6-  The shining of the dawn: so accord.
to some in the Kur ubi suprà: (T:) and 'Alee is
related to have said that وَفَارَ التَّنُّورُ means and
daybreak rose or rises: (TA:) or it relates to the
welling forth of water from the place of the
mosque of El-Koofeh: (T:) or التّنّور here signifies a well-known spring of water: (Hr, TA:)
or a certain mountain near El-Maseesah; (I'Ab,
K, TA;) i. e., (TA,) 'Eyn-el-Ward, in El-Jezeereh;
(I'Ab, T, TA;) or 'Eyn-Wardeh. (Bd in xi. 42.)
