Ibn-Mes'ood, (K,) القُرْآنُ لَا يَتْفَهُ وَلَا يَتَشَّانُ, (S,
K, [in the CK, erroneously, يُتْفَهُ and يُتَشانُّ, and
in some copies of the K, for the latter is put
ينتان,]) i. e. لَا يَغِثُّ وَ لَا يَخْلَقُ (assumed tropical:)  [The Kur-án will
not become meagre, nor will it become worn out]:
(K: [in the CK, erroneously, لا يُغَثُّ و لا يُخْلَقُ:])
it is implied by the context in the S, that لا يتفه
means will not become paltry, or mean: لايتشانّ
means will not become worn out by reason of
much repetition; from شَنُّ signifying “ a wornout water-skin. ” (TA.)
