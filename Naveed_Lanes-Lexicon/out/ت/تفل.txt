تَفِلَ
(S, M, Msb, K) and
تَفُلَ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَفْلٌ,
(T, S, M, Msb,) He spat; syn. بَصَقَ: (M, K:)
[or rather, he spat, emitting a small quantity of
saliva, generally in scattered portions, as when
one spits forth some minute thing:] التَّفْلُ is
similar to البَزْقُ, but less in degree: (S, Msb: *) the
first degree is البَزْقُ; then, التَّفْلُ; then, النَّفْثُ;
and then, النَّفْخُ: (S:) التَّفْلُ with the mouth is
[an action] never without somewhat of spittle: a
blowing without spittle is [said to be] termed
نَفْثٌ. (T.) Hence, تَفْلُ الرَّاقِى [The spitting of
the charmer, in which he emits a small quantity
of saliva at a time, in scattered portions: see
also نَفَثَ]. (S.) One says also, ذَاقَ مَآءَ البَحْرِ فَتَفَلَهُ,
i. e. [He tasted the water of the sea, and] spirted
it forth, by reason of dislike thereof. (TA.)

of having neglected, or left off the use of, perfume
