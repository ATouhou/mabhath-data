تو4
اتوى, said of a man, signifies جَآءَ تَوًّا, i. e.
He came alone; by himself: opposed to أَزْوَى
meaning “ he came with another. ” (T.)
-A2-  See
also art. توى.
تَوٌّ [app. from the Persian تُوْ, meaning “ a fold,”
or “ a single fold,”,] One, and no more; single; sole.
(T, S, M, K.) You say, كَانَ تَوًّا فَصَارَ زَوًّا He,
or it, was one only, and became a pair. (TA.) And
it is said in a trad., الطَّوَافُ تَوٌّ وَالاِسْتِجْمَارُ تَوٌّ, (S,
TA,) i. e., The circuiting [of the Kaabeh] is one
action, and the casting of the pebbles [in the valley of
Minè] is one action. (TA.) You say also, جَآءَ تَوٌّا,
meaning He came alone; by himself: (T, S, M:)
or he came by a direct course, nothing making
him to deviate, and not stopping anywhere in the
road; for if he stop anywhere in the road, he is
not said to be توّ. (AZ, A'Obeyd, M, K.) And
عَقَدْتُهُ بِتَوٍّ وَاحِدٍ I tied it with a single knot; by
turning the cord, or the like, once: so says AZ;
and he cites the following ex.:
جَارِيَةٌ لَيْسَتْ مِنَ الوَحْشَنِّ
لَا تَعْقِدُ المَنْطَقَ بِالمُشْتَنِّ
إِلَّا بِتَوٍّ وَاحِدٍ أَوْ تَنِّ
i. e., [A girl that is not of the wild, or shy, sort:
she does not tie the zone with the fist, but with a
single knot, or] half a knot: the ن in تَنّ [and in
وَحْشَنّ and مُشْتَنّ] is redundant: تَنّ being originally تَ, which is a contraction [or rather the
half, both as to the letter and the meaning,] of
تَوّ. (T.) ―
-b2-  A rope that is twisted of a single
strand: pl. أَتْوَآءٌ. (T, M, K.) ―
-b3-  [It is said that]
it signifies also A thousand horses, or horsemen.
(AZ, T, K.) [But this requires consideration:
for] one says, وَجَّهَ فُلَانٌ مِنْ خَيْلِهِ بِأَلْفٍ تَوٍّ, (AZ,
T, S,) meaning [Such a one sent a troop of his
horses] with a thousand men; i. e., with one
thousand: (S, TA:) or, as some say, with one
complete thousand. (TA.)
-A2-  Also One who is
unoccupied by the business of the present world
and of the world to come. (AA, T, K. *)
-A3-  Also
A structure elevated, reared, or erected. (T, K.)
تَوَّةٌ A period, or a short period, (سَاعَةٌ, AA,
T, K,) of time. (AA, T.) You say, مَضَتْ تَوَّةٌ
مِنَ اللَّيْلِ, and النَّهَار, A period, or a short period,
(ساعة,) of the night passed, and of the day. (TA.)
And مَا مَضَى إِلَّا حَتَّى كَانَ كَذَا There passed
not save a short period (ساعة) to the time that
such a thing happened. (IAar, T.) Hence the
saying of the vulgar, تَوَّةً قَامَ [commonly pronounced تَوَّهْ] Just now (السَّاعَةَ) he rose, or stood.
(TA.)
