it in the way of imitation, and in respect of rank;
for the moon borrows its light of the sun, and is
to it in the place of a successor. (Er-Rághib.)
Here, Ks pronounced تلاها with imáleh, [either
because تَلَيْتُ is a dial. var. of تَلَوْتُ, or] because,

S, * M,) and did according to it; (I'Ab, Mujáhid,
T;) namely, the Scripture: (I'Ab, Mujáhid,
T, M:) or the inf. n. specially signifies the following God's revealed Scriptures, sometimes by
reading, or perusing, or by reciting, and sometimes by conforming therewith [as well as by

(A'Obeyd, T;) or, what the devils of the Jinn,
or of mankind, or of both, read, or recited, or

the saying, لَا دَرَيْتَ وَلَا تَلَيْتَ: (T:) or, accord.
to Yoo, it is ↓ ولا أَتْلَيْتَ: (T, S:) and others say
that it is ولا ائْتَلَيْتَ, from أَلَوْتُ. (T. [See these
