ترقQ. Q. 1
تَرْقَيْتُهُ, (ISk, JK, S, K,) inf. n. تَرْقَاةٌ,
(ISk, S, K,) I hit, or hurt, his (a man's, ISk,
JK, S) تَرْقُوَة [or collar-bone]. (ISk, JK, S, K.)
تَرْقُوَةٌ The collar-bone; the bone between the
pit at the uppermost part of the chest and the
shoulder, (JK, S, Mgh, K,) on either side, connecting those two parts, (JK, Mgh,) of a man &c.;
(TA;) each of the two prominent bones in the
uppermost part of the chest, from the head of
each shoulder to the edge of the pit above mentioned: (TA in art. ترب:) [and sometimes, as
in a phrase which see below,] the fore part of
the حَلْق [here app. meaning the throat], at the
uppermost part of the chest, the place into which
the soul [for النَّفَسُ, in copies of the K, I read
النَّفْسُ] rises [when one is at the point of death]:
(K in art. رقو:) pl. تراقٍ (JK, Mgh, K) and ترائِق;
(JK, K;) the latter formed by transposition:
(JK:) Fr says that the latter pl. is used by some
for the former: (TA:) the sing. is of the measure
فَعْلُوَةٌ, (JK, S, K,) as is shown by the verb mentioned above, (K,) though it is repeated in the
K in art. رقو: (TA:) one should not say تُرْقُوَةٌ,
with damm to the ت. (S K.) إِذَا بَلَغَتِ التَّرَاقِىَ,
in the Kur lxxv. 26, means When it (the soul)
reaches the uppermost parts of the chest; [or,
the parts of the throat next the chest;] for النَّفْسُ
is understood: (Bd:) said when one is at the
point of death. (TA.)
تِرْيَاقٌ, an arabicized word, (S, Msb, K,) from
the Greek, (Msb, K,) [i. e. from
θηρια� degreesὰ,] or originally Persian, (S, O,) also written and pronounced
دِرْيَاقٌ, (JK, Msb,) and طِرْيَاقٌ; (Msb;) or, as
some say, from الرِّيقُ, because containing the
spittle of serpents, and, if so, it is Arabic [in
origin]: (Msb:) [Theriac; also called treacle;]
an antidote for poisons; (S, O;) a certain compound medicine, (K,) comprising many ingredients, at most ninety or ninety-six, and at least
sixty-four, (TA,) sometimes including the flesh of
vipers, (K, TA,) and that of asses, which cause it
to be prohibited and impure, or, as some say, it is
prohibited without restriction: (TA:) it is a
remedy against the bite or sting of rapacious
venomous reptiles and the like, and poisonous
potions: (K: [I omit some unprofitable and
absurd particulars respecting the compounds thus
termed, in the K and other lexicons &c.:]) pl.
تَرَايِيقُ. (K in art. فرق.) The best kind is called
التِّرْيَاقُ الفَارُوقُ, (K in art. فرق,) vulgarly تِرْيَاقٌ
فَارُوقِىٌّ. (TA in that art.) [A principal ingredient
of this kind is the best sort of Jews-pitch, i. e.
asphaltum, also called mumia, and in Arabic
مُومِيَا:) (see De Sacy's “ Rel. de l'Égypte par Abdallatif,” ” p. 274:) and this mumia, by itself, is
called التِّرْيَاقُ التُّرْكِىُّ.] ―
-b2-  [It is sometimes applied to Treacle, as meaning the sirop that drains
from sugar.] It is also said to be applied to the
فَادْزَهْر [or Bezoar-stone], likewise termed مَسُوسٌ.
(TA in art. مس.) ―
-b3-  Also, and ↓ تِرْيَاقَةٌ, (assumed tropical:)  Wine;
(S, O, K;) because it dispels anxiety; (S;) or
because it is a remedy for anxieties; (O;) wherefore it is also termed صَابُونُ الهُمُومِ. (TA.)
تِرْيَاقَةٌ: see the last sentence above.
[بَاذِنْجَانُ تِرْيَاقِىٌّ Zanthium.]
