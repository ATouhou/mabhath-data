تَخْمٌ The limit, or boundary, (S, Msb,) of any
town (S) or land: (S, Msb:) pl. تُخُومٌ: (S,
Msb:) a poet (Aboo-Keys Ibn-El-Aslat, TA)
says,
يَا بَنِىَّ التُّخُومُ لَا تَظْلِمُوهَا
(Fr, S,) or, as some relate it, ↓ التَّخُومُ: (TA:)
accord. to the former reading, Fr says, the meaning is, [O my sons,] the limits, or boundaries,
[misplace ye not them], for he does not say
تَظْلِمُوهُ: but ISK says, I heard AA say, it is
↓ تَخُوم, and the pl. is تُخُمٌ; like صَبُورٌ and صُبُرٌ:
(S:) both IAar and ISk say that the sing and
pl. are like رَسُولٌ and رُسُلٌ: (Msb:) but the latter
mentions also تُخُومٌ, with damm, as a pl. form,
having no sing.: (TA:) or ↓ تَخُومٌ signifies a
sign, or mark [of a boundary or of a way]: and
limits, or boundaries: and is sometimes with
↓ [to the ت]: (Mgh:) Lth says that تخوم
[written without any vowel-sign] signifies a division, or place of division, between two districts
and two towns or villages; and the limit, or
boundary, of the land of any district and town or
village is its تخوم: and AHeyth says that this
word signifies limits, or boundaries: (TA:) or
تُخُومٌ, with damm, signifies a sign, or mark, and
a limit, or boundary, that is a division between
two lands; and is of the fem. gender: and the
pl. is تُخُومٌ also, and تُخُمٌ: (K:) this app. means
that these are pls. of تُخُومٌ; but the former is
a word that is used as a sing. and as a pl.; and
the latter is pl. of تَخُومٌ, like as صُبُرٌ is of صَبُورٌ,
and غُفُرٌ of غَفُورٌ: (TA:) or (as ISk says, TA)
the sing. is ↓ تُخْمٌ and تَخْمٌ (K) and ↓ تَخُومَةٌ:
(AHn, S, * K:) accord. to A'Obeyd, the Arabic
linguists say ↓ تَخُومٌ, like صَبُورٌ, making it fem.
and sing.; but the people of Syria say تُخُومٌ,
with damm to the ت, making it pl., and the sing.
is تَخْمٌ: accord. to IB, one says ↓ تَخُومٌ and تُخُومٌ,
and زَبُورٌ and زُبُورٌ, and عَذُوبٌ and عُذُوبٌ; and
no fourth instance of the kind is known; [but see
عَذُوبٌ;] and the Basrees pronounce it with damm
[to the ت], and the Koofees with fet-h. (TA.)
It is said in a trad., مَلْعُونٌ مَنْ غَيَّرَ تُخُومَ الأَرْضِ,
meaning, accord. to A'Obeyd, [Cursed is he who
alters] the limits, or boundaries, of land; and the
signs, or marks, of the way: or, as some say, the
limits, or boundaries, of the sacred territory. (TA.)
And اجعل همّك تخومًا, [or rather اِجْعَلْ لِهَمِّكَ
↓ تَخُومًا,] means (tropical:)  [Set thou to thy purpose] a limit,
to which go thou, and pass not beyond it. (TA.)
And هُوَ طَيِّبُ التُّخُومِ (assumed tropical:)  He is good in respect of
ancestry, or origin: (JK:) or in respect of
natural dispositions; or, as some relate the saying,
↓ التَّخُومِ. (TA.) تُخُومٌ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  A state,
or condition, that one desires [app. as the limit of
his wish]. (IAar, Sh, K.)
