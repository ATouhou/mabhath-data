تنم1
تَنَمَ, (M, K, [in the CK, erroneously, تَنَوَّمَ,])
without teshdeed to the ن, (M, TA,) He (a
camel) ate the تَنُّوم. (M, K.)
تَنُّومٌ A kind of trees (S, M, K) having a small
fruit, (S, M,) like that of the خِرْوَع [or castor-oil
plant], (M,) which, bursting, discloses grains, that
are eaten by the people of the desert: (S, M:)
as the sun declines, it follows it with the [upper]
sides of its leaves: (M:) its fruit, with حُرْف,
(K,) i. e. حَبُّ الرَّشَادِ [q. v.], (TA,) and water,
drunk, expels worms; and the application of its
leaves, with vinegar, in the manner of a poultice,
draws forth warts: (K:) n. un. with ة: (S, M,
K:) AHn says, it is a kind of dust-coloured trees,
of those termed أَغْلَاث, eaten by ostriches and
gazelles, and of those among which gazelles are
snared: its grain, when the coverings thereof
open, becomes black; and it has a root (عِرْق),
sometimes made into a زَنْد [for producing fire]:
the places where it grows are mostly the sides of
valleys: IAar says, the تنّومة is a tree of the kind
called جَنْبَة, of large size, in which grow grains
like hemp-seed, used for ointment, and as a seasoning, or condiment: it dries up at the beginning of
winter, and disappears: all this is from AHn:
(M:) A'Obeyd says, it is one of the plants of the
earth, in which, and in the fruit whereof, is a
blackness: it is eaten by the ostrich: the pl. [or
coll. gen. n.] is تَنُّومٌ: (T: the author of which
then adds,) I say, it is a tree which I have seen
in the desert: the colour of its leaves inclines to
blackness, and it has grains like hemp-seed, or a
little larger: I have seen the women of the desert
bruise its grains, and express from them a blue
oil, in which is a viscosity; and they anoint their
hair with it when they comb themselves: AA says,
the تنّوم has a grain which is oily and dustcoloured: En-Nadr says, the تنّومة is of an ill
savour, and the beasts do not like it, or eat much
of it: (T:) [it is erroneously said in the K, voce
طُلَّامٌ, to be hemp-seed (حَبُّ الشَّاهْدَانِج): and]
some say that it is the hemp-plant (شجر الشهدانج).
(Ham p. 135.) The sun, when eclipsed, is
said in a trad. to have become black, and like a
تنّومة. (T.) And a poet, who married a woman,
and found her to be pretty, but with hoary hair,
and who had a youthful wife at his abode, likens
the hair of the former to the flower of the أُقْحُوَان,
and black hair to تنّوم; saying
وَلَمَّا رَأَيْتُ الأُقْحُوَانَ مُنَوِّرًا
وَلَمْ أَرَ تَنُّومًا تَذَكَّرْتُ مَنْزِلِى
[And when I saw the chamomile flowering, and
saw not tennoom, I remembered my abode]. (Ham
ubi suprà.)
