الأَرْضُ [The earth;] that whereon are mankind:
(TA:) [and earth, as opposed to heaven: and the
ground, as meaning the surface of the earth, on
which we tread and sit and lie; and the floor:
without ال signifying a land, or country: and
a piece of land or ground: and land, or soil, or
ground, considered in relation to its quality:] it is
fem.: (S, A, Msb, K:) and is a coll. gen. n.; (S,
A, K;) of which the n. un. should be أَرْضَةٌ, but
this they did not say: (S:) or a pl. having no
sing.; (A, K;) for أَرْضَةٌ has not been heard:
(K:) its pl. is أَرَضَاتٌ, (S, K,) in [some of] the
copies of the K أَرْضَاتٌ, (TA,) for they sometimes
form the pl. of a word which has not the fem. ة
with ا and ت, as in the instance of عُرُسَاتٌ; (S;)
and أَرَضُونَ, [which is more common,] (AZ, AHn,
S, Mgh, Msb, K,) with fet-h to the ر, (AZ, AHn,
Mgh, Msb,) and with و and ن, though a fem.
has not its pl. formed [regularly] with و and ن
unless it is of the defective kind, like ثُبَةٌ and ظُبَةٌ,
but they have made the و and ن [in this instance]
a substitute for the ا and ت which they have
elided [from أَرَضَاتٌ], and have left the fet-hah of
the ر as it was; (S;) but they also said أَرْضُونَ,
(AZ, AHn, S,) sometimes, making the ر quiescent;
(S;) and أُرُوضٌ (AZ, AHn, Msb, K) is sometimes
used as a pl., as in the saying مَا أَكْثَرَ أُرُوضَ بَنِى
فُلَانٍ [How many are the lands of the sons of
such a one!]; (TA;) and another [and very
common] pl. is [أَرَاضٍ, with the article written]
الأَرَاضِى, contr. to rule, (S, Msb, K,) as though
they had formed a pl. from آرُضٌ; (S;) thus
written in all the copies of the S; [accord. to SM;
but in one copy of the S, I find كَأَنَّهُمْ جَمَعُوا ااراضًا;
and in another, ارضًا;] and in one copy [is added],
“ thus it is found in his [J's] handwriting; ” but
IB says that correctly he should have said أَرْضَى,
like أَرْطَى; for as to آرُضٌ, its regular pl. would
be أَوَارِضُ; and [SM says] I have found it
observed in a marginal note to the S that the pl.
of آرُضٌ would be أَآرِضُ, like as أَكَالِبُ is pl. of
أَكْلُبٌ; and wherefore did he not say that الاراضى
is a pl. of an unused sing., like لَيَالٍ and أَهَالٍ, so
that it is as though it were pl. of أَرْضَاةٌ, like as
لَيَالٍ is pl. of لَيْلَاةٌ? yet if any one should propose
the plea that it may be formed by transposition
from أَآرِضُ, he would not say what is improbable;
its measure being in this case أَعَالِفُ; the word
being أَرَاضِئُ, and the ء being changed into ى:
(TA:) accord. to Abu-l-Khattáb, (S,) آرَاضٌ is
also a pl. of أَرْضٌ, (S, K,) like as آهَالٌ is a pl. of
أَهْلٌ; (S;) but IB says that, in the opinion of
the critics, the truth with respect to what is
related on the authority of Abu-l-Khattáb is, that
from أَرْضٌ and أَهْلٌ are formed أَرَاضٍ and أَهَالٍ, as
though they were pls. of أَرْضَاةٌ and أَهْلَاةٌ; like as
they said لَيْلَةٌ and لَيَال, as though this were pl. of
لَيْلَاةٌ. (TA.) It is said in proverbs, أَجْمَعُ مِنَ
الأَرْضِ [More comprehensive than the earth]:
(TA:) and آمَنُ مِنَ الأَرْضِ [More trustworthy
than the earth, in which treasures are securely
buried]: and أَشَدُّ مِنَ الأَرْضِ [Harder than the
earth, or ground]: (A, TA:) and أَذَلُّ مِنَ الأَرْضِ
[More vile, or more submissive, than the earth, or
ground]. (TA.) And you say, مَنْ أَطَاعَنِى كُنْتُ
لَهُ أَرْضَا (tropical:)  [Whoso obeyeth me, I will be to him as
ground whereon one treads]; denoting submissiveness. (A, TA.) And فُلَانٌ إِنٌ ضُرِبَ فَأَرْضٌ (tropical:)  [Such
one, if he be beaten, is like ground]; i. e. he cares
not for beating. (A, TA.) One says also, لَا أَرْضَ
لَكَ [Mayest thou have no land, or country! or
thou hast no land, or country]; like as one says,
لَا أُمَّ لَكَ. (S, K,) ―
-b2-  [And hence,] هُوَ ابْنُ أَرْضٍ
He is a stranger, (A, K, TA,) of whom neither
father nor mother is known. (TA.) ―
-b3-  اِبْنُ الأَرْضِ
[with the art. ال prefixed to the latter word] is A
certain plant, (AHn, K,) which comes forth upon
the summits of the [hills called] آكَام, having a
stem (أَصْل), but not growing tall, (AHn,) which
resembles hair, and is eaten, (AHn, K,) and
quickly dries up; (AHn;) a species of بَقْل, as
also بِنْتُ الأَرْضِ: (S in art. بنى:) and بَنَاتُ الأَرْضِ
plants: (M in art. بسر:) and the places which are
concealed from the pastor. (S in that art.) Also
The pool that is left by a torrent: (T in art. بنى:)
and بَنَاتُ الأَرْضِ pools in which are remains of
water: (IAar in TA art. بسر:) and rivulets. (T
in art. بنى.) ―
-b4-  أَرْضٌ is also used to signify (assumed tropical:)  A
carpet; or anything that is spread: and in this
sense, in poetry, it is sometimes made masc.
(Msb.) ―
-b5-  And (assumed tropical:)  Anything that is low. (S, K.)
And (tropical:)  The lower, or lowest, part of the legs of a
horse or the like: (S, K:) or the legs of a camel
or of a horse or the like: and the part that is
next to the ground thereof. (TA.) You say
بَعِيرٌ شَدِيدُ الأَرْضِ (tropical:)  A camel strong in the legs.
(TA.) And فَرَسٌ بَعِيدٌ مَا بَيْمَ أَرْضِهِ وَسَمَائِهِ (tropical:)  A

below, (lit. after,) them. (TA.) ―
-b7-  And of a
sandal, (assumed tropical:)  [The lower surface of the sole;] the
part that touches the ground. (TA.)
-A2-  A febrile
shivering; a tremor: (S, K:) or vertigo: or it
signifies also vertigo arising from a relaxed state,
and occasioning a defluxion from the nose and eyes.
(TA.) I'Ab is related to have said, on the occasion of an earthquake, أَزُلْزِلَتِ الأَرْضُ أَمْ بِى أَرْضٌ,
(S,) i. e. [Hath the earth been made to quake, or
is there in me] a tremor? or a vertigo? (TA.)
[أَهْلُ الأَرْضِ signifies A certain class of the jinn,
or genii; by whom human beings are believed to
be possessed, and affected by an involuntary tremor; whence it seems that this appellation may
perhaps be from أَرْضٌ as signifying “ a tremor. ”
See مَأْرُوضٌ: and see خَبَلٌ, as explained in the S.]

it is a white worm, resembling the ant, appearing
in the days of the [season called] رَبِيع: (TA:)
there are two kinds: one kind is small, like the
large of the ذَرّ [or grubs of ants]; and this is the
bane of wood in particular: (AHn, TA:) or this
kind is the bane of wood and of other things, and
is a white worm with a black head, not having
wings, and it penetrates into the earth, and builds
for itself a habitation of clay, or soil; and this
is said to be that which ate the staff of Solomon
[as is related in the Kur xxxiv. 13, where it is
called دَابَّةُ الأَرْضِ, as is said in the A]: (TA:) the
other kind [is the termite, or white ant; termes
fatale of Linn.; called by Forskål (in his Descr.
Animalium &c., p. 96,) termes arda, destructor;
and this] is like a large common ant, having wings;
it is the bane of everything that is of wood, and
of plants; except that it does not attack what is
moist, or succulent; and it has legs: (AHn, TA:)
