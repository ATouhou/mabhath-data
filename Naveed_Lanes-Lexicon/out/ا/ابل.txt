among herbage that has dried up;] growing after

(TA.)
إِبِلٌ (T, S, M, Msb, K, &c.,) said by Sb to be
the only subst. of this form except حِبِرٌ, and to
have none like it among epithets except بِلِزٌ; for
though other instances are mentioned, they are
not of established authority; (Msb;) but IJ
mentions, with these, حِبِكٌ and إِطِلٌ [which may
be of established authority]; (TA;) [and to these
may be added إِبِطٌ and إِبِدٌ, and perhaps نِكِحٌ and
خِطِبٌ; respecting which see إِبِدٌ;] and for إِبِلٌ
one says also ↓ إِبلٌ, (S, Msb, K, &c.,) sometimes,
by way of contraction; (S, Msb;) or this may be
a dial. var. of the former; (Kr, MF;) [Camels:
and a herd of camels: or] at the least, applied to
a صِرْمَة; i. e. a number [of camels] more than a
ذَوْد [which is at least nine,] up to thirty; after
which is the هَجْمَة, i. e. forty and upwards; and
then, هُنَيْدَةُ, which is a hundred of إِبِل: (T:) or,
accord. to Ibn-'Abbád, a hundred of إِبِل: (TA:)
it is a quasi-pl. n.; (Az, S, ISd, Z, O, Msb, &c.;)
a word having no proper sing.; (S, M, O, Msb;)
and is of the fem. gender, because the quasi-pl. n.
that has no proper sing. is necessarily fem. (S, O,
Msb) when not applied to human beings, (S, O,)
or when applied to irrational beings, (Msb,) and
has ة added in the dim.; (S, Msb;) the dim. of
إِبِلٌ being ↓ أُبَيْلَةٌ: (S, Msb, K:) it is said in the
K that it is a sing. applied to a pl. number, and
is not a pl., nor a quasi-pl. n.; but in this assertion together with the saying that the dim. is as
above is a kind of contradiction; for if it be a
sing., and not a quasi-pl. n., what is the reason
of its being fem.? (TA:) the pl. is آبَالٌ (S, M,
Msb, K) and أَبِيلٌ [like عَبِيدٌ pl. of عَبْدٌ, q. v.];
(Msb, TA;) the pl. meaning herds [of camels];
and in like manner أَغْنَامٌ and أَبْقَارٌ mean flocks
of sheep or goats and herds of bulls or cows:
(Msb, TA:) and the dual, إِبلَانِ, means two
herds [of camels], (Sb, T, S, M, Msb,) each with
its pastor; (T;) like as غَنَمَانِ means two flocks
of sheep or goats: (S:) or, accord. to Ibn-'Abbád,
the dual means two hundreds of إِبِل. (TA.) ―
-b2-
الإِبِلُ الصُّغْرَى [The smaller camels] is an appellation applied to sheep; because they eat more than
goats. (IAar in TA art. ضبط.) ―
-b3-  It is said in the
Kur [lxxxviii. 17], أَفَلَا يَنْظُرُونَ إِلَى الْإِبِلِ كَيْفَ
خُلِقَتْ, meaning, accord. to 'Aboo-Amr Ibn-El-
'Alà, (T, TA,) (tropical:)  [Will they not then consider]
the clouds that bear the water for rain, [how they
are created?] (T, K, TA:) but accord. to him
who reads الإِبْلِ, the meaning is, the camels. (T,
TA.)
أُبْلَةٌ A blight, blast, taint, or the like: (T, K:)
thus written by IAth, agreeably with the authority
of Aboo-Moosà; (TA;) occurring in a trad., in
which it is said that one should not sell dates
until he is secure from الاُبْلَةٌ; (T, TA;) but
accord. to a commentary on the Nh, it is correctly
written ↓ أَبَلَةٌ [q. v.] (TA.)
إِبْلَةٌ Enmity; hostility. (Kr, M, K.)
أَبَلَةٌ Unwholesomeness and heaviness of food;
(S, M, K;) originally وَبَلَةٌ, like as أَحَدٌ is originally وَحَدٌ; (S;) as also ↓ أَبَلٌ. (K.) It is said
in a trad. that this departs from every property
for which the poor-rate has been paid. (S, M.)
―
-b2-  See also أُبْلَةٌ. ―
-b3-  An evil quality of herbage or
pasture. (AHn, TA in art. نشر.) ―
-b4-  A cause
of harm or injury; evil; mischief. (TA.) ―
-b5-
A consequence of an action, or a claim which
one seeks to obtain for an injury; and a cause
of blame or dispraise: having these meanings in
the saying, إِنْ فَعَلْتَ ذَاكَ فَقَدْ خَرَجْتَ مِنْ أَبَلَتِهِ
[If thou do that, thou wilt escape from its consequence, &c.]. (T.) ―
-b6-  A fault, vice, or the like.
(Aboo-Málik, T.) So in the saying, مَا عَلَيْكَ فِى
هٰذَا الأَمْرِ أَبَلَةٌ [There is not to be charged against
thee, in this affair, any fault, &c.]. (T.) ―
-b7-  A
crime; a sin; an unlawful action. (K.) ―
-b8-
Rancour, malevolence, malice, or spite. (IB.)

derotee: (TA:) or an old man, or elder: (M:)
or the chief, or head-man, of the Christians: (M,
K:) or the man who calls them to prayer by
means of the نَاقُوس; (A Heyth, M, * K;) the
beater of the ناقوس: (IDrd:) as also ↓ أَيْبَلِىٌّ,
(M and K, but according to the M as meaning
“ a monk,”) which is either a foreign word, or
changed by the relative ى, or of the same class
as إِنْقَحْلٌ [in which the first letter as well as th
second is augmentative], for Sb says that there is
not in the language an instance of the measure
فَيْعَلٌ; (M;) and ↓ أَيْبُلِىٌّ, and هَيْبَلِىٌّ, and ↓ أَبُلِىٌّ
and ↓ أَيْبَلٌ, (K,) which last is disallowed by Sb
for the reason stated above; (TA;) and ↓ أَيْبُلٌ
like أَيْنُقٌ; and ↓ أَيْبِلِىٌّ; (K;) the last with fet-h
to the hemzeh, and kesr to the ب, and with the
[first] ى quiescent; or أَيْبَلِىٌّ [app. a mistranscription for أَيْبِلِىٌّ] is used by poetic licence for ↓ أَبِيلِىٌّ,
like أَيْنُقٌ for أَنْوُقٌ: (TA:) pl. آبَالٌ (M, K) and
أُبْلٌ, or أُبُلٌ, [accord. to different copies of the
K,] with damm [which indicates that the former
is meant, though it is irregular]. (K.) By
أَبِيلٌ الأَبِيلِينَ is meant 'Eesà [or Jesus], (S, K,)

bundle of firewood; and so ↓ أُبَالَةٌ and بُلَةٌ (K)
and ↓ إِبَّالَةٌ: (Bd in cv. 3; but there explained
only as signifying a great bundle:) or a bundle
of dry herbage; (M, TA;) and so ↓ إِبَّالَةٌ (K)
and ↓ أَبِيلٌ and ↓ أَبِيلَةٌ (M, K) and ↓ إِيبَالَةٌ, (K, [in
the CK اَيْبَالَة,]) with one of the two ب s changed
into ى, and mentioned by Az, but it is said in the

change may not be made in a word of the measure
فِعَّالَةٌ, with ة, but only in one without ة, as in
the cases of دِينَارٌ and قِيرَاطٌ; (TA;) and وَبِيلَةٌ
signifies the same, (K,) belonging to art. وبل.
(TA.) Hence the prov., (S, TA,) صِغْثٌ عَلَى
إِبَالَةٍ and ↓ إِبَّالَةٍ, (S, K, &c.,) but the former is the
more common, and ↓ إِيبَالَةٍ, which is allowed by
Az but disallowed by J; (TA;) [lit. A handful
of herbage, or the like, upon a bundle, or great
bundle, of firewood, or a bundle of dry herbage;]

of other birds; (T, TA;) accord. to IAar.
(TA.) It is said to be the sing. of ↓ أَبَابِيلٌ: (T,
S, M, and Jel in cv. 3:) Ks says, I used to
hear the grammarians say that this latter has for
its sing. إِبَّوْلٌ, like عِجَّوْلٌ, of which the pl. is
عَجَاجِيلٌ: (Msb:) or its sing. is ↓ إِبَيلٌ; (S,
Msb;) but he who says this adds, I have not
found the Arabs to know a sing. to it: (S:) or
each of these is its sing.; (M, Jel;) and so is
↓ إِبَّالٌ: (Jel:) or its sing. is ↓ إِبَّالَةٌ, (Bd in cv. 3,
and Msb,) originally signifying “a great bundle:”
(Bd:) it is said that this seems to be its sing.;
and so ↓ أَبَّالَةٌ: or the sing. may be ↓ إِيبَالَةٌ, like as

of dispersion: (M:) or dispersed companies, one
following another: (Msb:) or distinct, or separate, companies, (Akh, S, Msb, K,) like leaning
