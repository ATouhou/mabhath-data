follows,]) The skin, or hide, that is not completely
tanned, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) so that it is unsubstantial, not firm, or strong, or tough: (Mgh:)
when its tanning is complete, and it becomes red,
it is termed أَدِيم: therefore أَفِيقٌ is of the measure
فَعِيلٌ in the sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ: (Msb:)
or in the second stage of its tanning; for in the
first stage it is termed مَنِيْئَة; then, افيق; and then,

hide, that is not tanned; but I am not sure of it:
(TA:) the pl. is أَفَقٌ, (Lh, JK, S, Msb, K,) like
as أَدَمٌ is pl. of أَدِيمٌ, (S,) or this is a quasi-pl. n.,
(M, K,) and أُفُقٌ (JK, K) is allowable, (JK,) or,
accord. to Lh, it is not allowable, (TA,) and [pl.
of pauc.] آفِقَةٌ, (As, S, K,) like as آدمَةٌ and أَرْغِفَةٌ
are pls. of أَدِيمٌ and رَغِيفٌ. (As, S.) ↓ أَفِيقَةٌ signifies also A سِقَآء [or skin for water or milk &c.]
made of a hide of the kind termed أَفِيق. (Mgh.)
And أَفِيقٌ also signifies The skin of a man, and of
any beast. (TA.)

copy of the JK,]) from أَفِقَ, (S, K,) or, as IB
says, accord. to Kz, from أَفَقَ, aor.
اَفِقَ, and so
