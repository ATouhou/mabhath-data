فَيْعَلَ, (M,) inf. n. إيَّابٌ, (M, K,) originally
إيوَابٌ, of the measure فِيعَالٌ, (M, TA,) or,
accord. to Fr, إِيَّابٌ is incorrect, and the right
word is إِيَابٌ: (TA:) [and if so, أَيَّبَ is perhaps
changed from أَوَّبَ, like as أَيْبَةٌ is from أَوْبَةٌ; and
تَأْيِيبٌ is perhaps its inf. n., changed from تَأْوِيبٌ:]
or, as some say, إِيَابٌ signifies only the returning
to one's family at night: (M, TA:) and أَهْلَهُ ↓ تأوّب
and اهله ↓ ائتاب [as well as آبَ إِلَى أَهْلِهِ] signify
he returned to his family at, or in, the night: (T,

forms of the verb are also given, but with the
sing. pronoun of the third pers. instead of the pl.,]
and K,) each in the form of a pass. part. n.;
(TA;) he came to them at night: (S, M, * A, K:)
and آبَ المَآءَ, (M,) inf. n. أَوْبٌ, (K,) signifies he
came to the water, to drink, at night; as also
↓ ائتابهُ; (M, K;) and ↓ تأوّبهُ: (M:) or, accord.

غَابَت. (S.) And آبَ إِلَيْهِ People came to
him from every direction, or quarter. (TA, from
a trad.) The poet Sáideh Ibn-El-'Ajlán uses the
expression, لَآبَكَ مُرْهَفٌ, meaning A thin sword
would have come to thee; in which the verb may
be trans. by itself, or the prep. إِلَى may be understood. (M, TA.) ―

or offence, and repented. (Msb.) ―

He made him to return to him, or it; as also
إلَيْهِ ↓ اوّبهُ. (M.) And آبَ يَدَهُ إِلَى سَيْفِهِ, (as in
a copy of the T,) or بِيَدِهِ, (as in a copy of the A,
[which is probably here the more correct],) He
put back his hand to his sword to draw it: (Lth,
T, A:) and الى قَوْسِهِ [to his bow] to draw it:
and الى سَهْمِهِ [to his arrow] to shoot it. (A.) ―

him; [i. e., with David;] (S, * M, TA;) but some
read معه ↓ اُوبِى, meaning return ye with him in
praising as often as he returneth therein: (M,
TA:) or, accord. to the former reading, the
meaning is, 0 mountains, labour ye with him in
praising God all the day, until the night: (T:)
