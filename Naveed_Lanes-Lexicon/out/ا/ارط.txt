ارط1
اَرڤطَ [The unaugmented verb from this root seems
to be unknown, if it were ever in use, for it is
not mentioned, though the pass. part. n., مَأْرُوطٌ,
is mentioned as having three significations, which
see below.]

آرَطَتِ الأَرْضُ, (AHeyth, K,) of the measure
أَفْعَلَت, [originally] with two alifs, (TA,) [aor.
يُؤْرِطُ, inf. n. إِيرَاطٌ,] The land produced the kind of
trees called أَرْطًى [or أَرْطَى]; (AHeyth, K;) as
also أَرْطَت, inf. n. إِرْطَآءٌ; or this is a corruption,
attributable to J: so says the author of the K,
following AHeyth: but it is no corruption, for
it is mentioned by the authors on verbs and by
ISd and others; (MF, TA;) for instance, by
AHn, in his book on plants, and by IF, in
the Mj: (TA:) [and J mentions it in its proper
place, in art. رطى, as well as in the present art.:]
↓ أَرَّطَت, with the ر musheddedeh, has also been
found in the handwriting of certain of the men
of letters; but this is a corruption. (K.)
أَرِطٌ A colour like that of the أَرْطًي [or أَرْطَي].
(Sgh, K.)
أَرْطًي, (Mbr, S, K,) of the measure فَعْلًى,
because you say أَدِيمٌ مَأْرُوطٌ, [explained below,]
(Mbr, S,) the alif (Mbr, S, K) ending it (Mbr)
[written ى] being a letter of quasi-coordination,
(S, K,) not to denote the fem. gender, (Mbr, S,)
its n. un. being أَرْطَاةٌ, (Mbr, S, K,) wherefore
it is with tenween when indeterminate, but not
when determinate: (S, K:) or it is of the
measure أَفْعَلٌ, (Mbr, * S,) the last letter being
radical, (Mbr,) because you say أَدِيمٌ مَرْطِيُّ,
(Mbr, S,) and in this case it should be mentioned
among words with an infirm letter [for the last
radical], and is with tenween both when determinate and when indeterminate; (S;) [but this
is a mistake, for when it is determinate, it can
be with tenween only if used as a proper name;
therefore,] IB observes, that if you make its
last letter radical, its measure is أَفْعَل, and a word
of this measure, if a subst., is imperfectly decl.
when determinate, but perfectly decl. when indeterminate: (TA:) [the author of the K copies
the error of the S, saying, “or its alif is radical,”
(meaning its last letter,) “ and in this case it is
always with tenween; ” and he adds, “or,” (for
which he should have said “ and,”) its measure
is أَفْعَل: to all which it is necessary to add,
that some of the grammarians hold it to be also
of the measure فَعْلَى, ending with a fem. alif,
and therefore assign to it no n. un.:] A kind of
tree, (S, K,) of those growing in sands, (S, TA,)
resembling the kind called عِضَاه, growing as a
branch [in the TA عَصَبًا, for which I read غُضْنًا,]
from a single stem, to the height of the stature
of a man, the leaves whereof are what are termed
هَدَب [q. v., and are included among those termed
خُوص], (AHn, TA,) and its flower is like that
of the خِلَاف [or salix ægyptia], (AHn, K,) save
in being smaller, the colour being one; and the
odour thereof is pleasant: it grows in sands, and
therefore the poets make frequent mention of the
wild bulls' and cows' taking refuge among this
and other trees of the sands, burrowing at their
roots to hide themselves there, and to protect
themselves from the heat and cold and rain, but
not among the trees in hard ground, for burrowing
in the sand is easy: (AHn, TA:) its fruit is
like the عُنَّاب [or jujube], bitter, and is eaten by
camels in its fresh moist state, and its roots are
red, (AHn, K,) intensely red: (AHn, TA:)
AHn adds, a man of the Benoo-Asad informed
me, that the leaves (هَدَب) of the ارطي are red
like the red pomegranate: its fruit also is red:
(TA:) the dual is أَرْطَيَانِ: (AHn, TA:) and the
pl. أَرْطَيَاتٌ and أَرَاطَيِ and أَرَاطٍ, (AHn, K,) in
the accus. case أرَاطِي. (TA.)
أَرْطَوِىٌّ: see what next follows.
أَرْطَاوِىُّ: see what next follows.
مَأْرُوطٌ A hide tanned with أَرْطًي; (S, K;) i. e.
with the leaves thereof; (S in art. رطي;) as also
↓ مُؤَرْطًي; (TA;) and so مَرْطِيٌّ. (S.) ―
-b2-  A
camel having a complaint from eating أَرْطًي:
(L, K: *) and a camel that eats أَرْطًي, (AZ, S, K,)
and keeps to it; (K;) as also ↓ أَرْطَوِىُّ (AZ, S, K)
and ↓ أَرْطَاوِىٌّ. (Ibn-'Abbád, Sgh, L, K.)
مُؤَرْطًي: see what next precedes.
