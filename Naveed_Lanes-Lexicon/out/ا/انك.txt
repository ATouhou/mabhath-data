انكآنُكٌ pure رَصَاص [or lead]: or black رِصِاص:
(Msb:) i. q. أُسْرُبُّ; (S, K;) i. e. رَصَاصٌ قَلْعِىٌّ;
so says Kt; and Az says, I think it is an arabicized word: (TA:) or white اسربّ: or black
اسربّ: or pure اسربّ: (K:) or i. q. قَزْدِيرٌ [which
is applied in the present day to tin, and pewter]:
(Kr:) El-Kásim Ibn-Maan says, I heard an
Arab of the desert say, هٰذَا رَصَاصٌ آنُكٌ, i. e. [this
is] pure [lead]: (TA:) it is of the measure أَفْعُلٌ,
[originally أَأْنُكٌ,] (S, K,) which is one of the
forms of pls., (S,) like أَفْلُسٌ; (Msb;) and there
is no other word of this measure, (Az, S, K,)
among sing. nouns, (Az, S,) except أَشُدٌّ [originally أَشْدُدٌ], (S, Sgh, K,) and آجُرٌ in the dial.
of those who pronounce it without teshdeed:
(Sgh:) it is disputed, however, whether أَشُدٌّ be
a sing. or a pl.: (Az, TA:) [and as to آجُرٌ, see
what follows:] or, accord. to some, (Msb,) آنُكٌ
is of the measure فَاعُلٌ, (Kr, Msb,) and is the only
word of that measure in Arabic: (Kr:) or it is
a foreign word; and so are آجُرٌ and [the proper
names] آمُلُ and كَابُلُ. (Msb.) It is said, in a
trad., that he who listens to a singing female
slave, آنُك shall be poured into his ears (S, TA)
on the day of resurrection. (TA.)
