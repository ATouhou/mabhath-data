ايه2
ايّه بِهَا, (S, TA,) and, accord. to some, بِهِمْ
(TA,) and بِهِ, (K, * TA,) inf. n. تَأْيِيهٌ, (S, K,) He
cried out to, or shouted to, and called, (S, K, TA,)
them, namely, camels, (S, TA,) and, accord. to
some, horses, and men, (TA,) and him, (K, TA,)
namely, a camel: (TA:) or ايّه به signifies he
said to him, namely, a man, and a horse, يَا وَيْهَاهْ
[Ho! On!]: (A 'Obeyd:) and he said to him,
namely, a man, يَا أَيُّهَا الرَّجُلُ [O thou man]: (K:)
or he called him, يا ايّها الرجل: (IAth:) and he cried out
to him, or at him; or drove him away with
crying or a cry; namely, an object of the chase.
(TA.)
[
أَيْهَ would seem to be a dial. var. of وَيْهَ; for
it is said that] أَيْهَكَ is syn. with وَيْهَكَ. (K: [but
see وَيْهَ.])
-A2-  أَيْهًا: see أَيْهَاتَ.
إِيهْ, with the ه quiescent, is a word used in
chiding, or checking; meaning حَسْبُكَ [Sufficient
for thee is such a thing; &c.]. (ISd, K.) ―
-b2-
إِيهًا signifies, (S, K,) as also ايهَ, (K,) a command
to be silent, (S, K,) and to abstain; (S, TA;)
i. e. Be silent; and abstain, or desist: (TA:)
both are used in chiding, or checking: and هِيهَ is
used in the place of إِيهَ. (Lth, TA.) You say
[also,] إِيهًا عَنَّا Be silent, and abstain from [troubling] us. (S, TA.) And إِيهَا عَنِّى الْآنَ Abstain
thou from [Troubling] me now. (AZ, TA.) ―
-b3-
إِيهًا also occurs as meaning I hold that to be true,
and approve it. (IAth, TA.)
-A2-  إِيهِ, as also إِيهَ
and إِيهٍ, is a word denoting a desire, or demand,
for one to add, or to give, or do, more; (Lth,
K;) and a desire for one to speak: (K:) it (i. e.
إِيهِ) is an imperative verbal noun, (S,) indecl.,
with kesr for its termination: (K:) you say to a
man, when you desire, or demand, his telling or
saying more of a [certain] story or subject of discourse, or his doing more of a [certain] deed, إِيهِ,
with kesr. to the ه; (S;) [i. e. Tell me, or say,
more of this; say on; go on, or proceed, with
this; or do more of this;] and افْعَلْ إِيهِ [Go on,
or proceed, with this; do it]; (AZ;) and for
إِيهِ, you say, هِيهِ: (Lth:) but when you make
no interruption after it, you pronounce it with
tenween, (ISk, S, K,) and say إِيهٍ, (ISk, S,)
which means حَدِّثْنَا [i. e. Tell us, or relate to us,
something]; (Ks, Lh, (ISk, * S; *) and for this
one says هِيهٍ, by substitution of one letter for
another: (Ks, Lh:) or it means زِدْ [i. e. tell, or
say, or do, something more]; and هَاتِ [i. e. give,
or relate, something]; (Har p. 592;) and تَكَلَّمَ
[i. e. speak]. (Idem p. 419.) In the following
saying of Dhu-r-Rummeh,
وَقَفْنَا وَ قُلْنَا إِيهِ عَنْ أُمِّ سَالِمٍ
وَ مَا بَالُ تَكْلِيمِ الدِّيَارِ البَلَاقِعِ
[We stopped, and we said, Tell us some tidings:
inform us (أَخْبِرِينَا being app. understood) respecting Umm-Sálim: but what is the case (meaning
what is the use) of speaking to the vacant dwellings?], he has used the word without tenween,
though making no interruption after it, because
he intended a pause. (ISk, S.) Ibn-Es-Seree
says, When you say, إِيهِ يَا رَجُلُ, you only command him to tell you more of the subject of
discourse known to you and him, as though
you said, هَاتِ الحَدِيثَ [Give, or relate, the story,
or narrative, O man]: but if you say, إِيهٍ, with
tenween, it is as though you said, هَاتِ حَدِيثًا مَّا
[Give, or relate, some story or narrative], because
the tenween renders indeterminate: and Dhu-rRummeh meant the tenween, but omitted it
through necessity. (S.) As says that Dhu-rRummeh has committed a mistake; the expression of the Arabs being only إِيهٍ [in a case of this
kind]: ISd says, the truth is, that it is without
tenween when determinate, and with tenween
when indeterminate; and that Dhu-r-Rummeh
asks the ruins to tell him more of a known
story, as though he said, Relate to us the story,
or tell us the tidings: (TA:) Aboo-Bekr Ibn-Es-Sarráj says, citing this verse, that ايه is not
known in a case of this kind without tenween
in any of the dialects; meaning that it is never
conjoined with a following word unless it be
with tenween. (IB, TA.)
أَيْهَا: see what next follows.
أَيْهَاتَ i. q. هَيْهَاتَ [Far, or far from being
believed or from the truth, is such a thing: or
remoteness, or remoteness from being believed or
from the truth, is to be attributed to such a
thing.]: as also ↓ أَيْهَانِ, (S, K,) and ↓ أَيْهَانَ, (K,
TA, in the CK اَيْهَانُ,) [and several other dial.
vars., for which see هَيْهَاتَ,] and ↓ أَيْهَا, (TA;
and so in some copies of the S and K; in other
copies of these, ↓ أَيْهًا; [but the former is app.
the right;]) with the ن [or the ت] suppressed,
(TA,) which is said in pronouncing [a thing] to
be remote [whether in a proper or a tropical sense]:
(S, TA:) Th explains ↓ أَيْهَانِ as meaning بَعِيدٌ
ذٰلِكَ AA explains it as meaning بَعُدَ ذٰلِكَ, making
it a verbal noun; and this is the correct explanation: (TA:) or the meaning is البُعْدُ, [as I have
indicated above,] (K in art. هيه,) but this is only
when لِ is prefixed to what follows it, as Sb says.
(TA. [See هَيْهَاتَ.])
أَيْهَانَ and أَيْهَانِ: see أَيْهَاتَ, in three places.
أَيِّهٌ Having a strong, or loud, voice; and
vigilant, or wary. (Ham p. 675.)
أَيُّهَا: see أَىٌّ; last portion of the paragraph.
