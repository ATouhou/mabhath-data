اسو1
أَسَا الجُرْحَ, (aor. يَأْسُو S,) inf. n. أَسْوٌ and
أَسًا, [but in the S, the latter seems to be mentioned as a simple subst.,] He dressed the wound;
treated it curatively, or surgically. (S, M, K.)
―
-b2-  [Hence,] هٰذَ أَمْرٌ لَا يُؤْسَى كَلْمُهُ (assumed tropical:)  [This is
an affair of which the evil (lit. the wound) will
not be remedied]. (S.) ―
-b3-  [Hence also,] أَسَا بَيْنَهُمْ,
(first pers. أَسَوْتُ, S, Msb, inf. n. أَسْوٌ, S, M,) (tropical:)  He
made peace, effected a reconciliation, or adjusted
a difference, between them; (S, M, Msb, K;)
as also بينهم ↓ أسّى. (El-Muärrij, TA.)
-A2-  أَسِيَ
aor. يَأْسَي, inf. n. أَسًا or أَسًي, He grieved, or
mourned, (S, M, Msb, K,) عَلَيْهِ [for him, or it],
(M, K,) and عَلَى مُصِيبَةٍ [for an affliction], and
لِفُلَانٍ [for such a one]. (S.) [This belongs to
the present art. and to art. اسى; but is distinguished in the M and K by being mentioned only
in the latter art.; though the inf. n. is mentioned
in the K in both arts.] Hence the saying, الإِسَآءُ
يَدْفَعُ الأَسَا [Medicine dispels grief, or mourning]
(TA.)
2
أسّى بَيْنَهُمْ: see 1.
-A2-  أسّاهُ, (S, M, K,) inf. n.
تَأْسِيَةٌ, (S, K,) i. q. عَزَّاهُ [He exhorted him, or enjoined him, to be patient; to take patience; or to
take example by, or console himself by the example
of, him who had suffered the like affliction]; (S,
M, K, TA;) saying to him, Wherefore dost thou
grieve, or mourn, when such a one is thine example
(إِسْوَتُكَ) ? i. e. what has befallen thee befell him,
and he was patient; therefore take thou example
by him and so be consoled (تَأَسِّ بِهِ). (TA.) You
say, أسّاهُ بِمُصِيبَةٍ i. e. عَزَّاهُ [He exhorted him, or
enjoined him, to be patient, &c., by mentioning
an affliction that had befallen another; unless
بمصيتة be a mistranscription for لِمُصِيبَةٍ on
account of an affliction]; as also ↓ آساهُ, with
medd. (TA.)

آسِيْتُهُ بِمَالِى, (S, Mgh,) inf. n. مُؤَاسَاةٌ, (S,
M, K,) I made him my object of imitation
(إِسْوَتِى), [meaning I made myself like him,] in
respect of my property: (S:) or I made him an
object of imitation [with, or in respect of, my
property], I imitating his example, and he imitating my example: (Mgh:) and وَاسَيْتُهُ is a dial.
var., but of weak authority: (S, Mgh:) and
آسَانِى [alone] he made me an object of imitation
to him by giving me of his property [and thus
reducing himself to my condition in some degree
while in the same degree raising me to his]; (Ham
p. 696;) and أُوَاسِيهِ [thus without a second ء] I
make him the object of my own imitation and so
share with him my property: (Id p. 198:) or
آساهُ بِمَالِهِ signifies he gave him of his property,
and made him an object of imitation in respect of
it: or only, of food sufficient for his want; not
of what is superabundant: (M, K:) whence the
saying, رَحِمَ اللّٰهُ رَجُلًا أَعْطَى مِنْ فَضْلٍ وَوَاسَى مِنْ
كَفَافٍ [May God have mercy on a man who has
given of superabundance, and imparted of food
only sufficient for his want so as to make himself
equal with him to whom he imparts of such food]:
(TA:) [and آساهُ signifies he shared with him:
and he was, or became, equal with him: for]
المُوَاسَاةُ occurs often in trads., signifying the
sharing with another, or making another to share
with one, in the means of subsistence [&c.]; and
is originally [المُؤَاسَاةُ,] with ء: also, the being, or
becoming, equal with another: (TA:) and you
say, آسَيْتُهُ بِنَفْسِي, meaning I made him equal with
myself; in the dial. of El-Yemen وَاسَيْتُهُ. (Msb.)
آسِ بَيْنَ النَّاسِ فِى وَجْهِكَ, in a letter of 'Omar,
means Make thou the people to share [alike], one
with another, in thy consideration and regard:
or, as some say, make thou them equal [in respect
thereof]. (Mgh.) The saying مَا يُؤَاسِي فُلَانٌ فُلَانًا
is explained in three different ways: accord. to
El-Mufaddal Ibn-Mohammad, it means Such a
one does not make such a one to share with him:
accord. to El-Muärraj, does not good to such a
one; from the saying of the Arabs, آسِ فُلَانًا بِخَيْرٍ
Do thou good to such a one: or, as some say,
does not give such a one any compensation for his
love, or affection, nor for his relationship; from
الأَوْسُ, meaning العَوْضُ; being originally يُؤَاوِسُهُ,
then يُؤَاسِوُهُ, and then يُؤَاسِيهِ: or it may be from
أَسَوْتُ الجُرْحَ. (IDrd, TA.) [See also an ex. voce
أَثَرَةٌ].

-b2-  I. q. تَعَزَّى [He took patience; or constrained himself to be patient; or
he took example by, or became consoled by the
example of, another who had suffered in like
manner and had been patient]. (S, M, K.) You
say, تأسّى بِهِ, i. e. تَعَزَّى بِهِ [He took patience, or
constrained himself to be patient, by reflecting
upon him, or it; or he took example by him, or
became consoled by his example, meaning the
example of a person who had suffered in like
manner and had been patient]. (S.) [See 2.]

تَآسَوْا signifies آسَى بَعْضُهُمْ بعْضًا [They imitated one another with their property, one giving
of his property to another, so that they thus
equalised themselves; they imitated one another
and so shared together their property; they
shared, one with another, in the means of subsistence, &c.; they were, or became, equal, one with
another: see 3]. (S, K.) A poet says,
وَإِنَّ الأُولَى بِالطَّفِّ مِنْ آل هَاشِمٍ
تَآسَوْا فَسَنُّوا لِلْكِرَامِ التَّآسِيَا
(S,) in which تآسوا is from المُؤَاسَاةُ; not from
التَّأَسِّي, as it is stated to be by Mbr, who says
that تآسوا means تَوَاسَوْاا and تَعَزَّوْا. (IB, TA.)
[This verse cited and translated in art. الى, voce
أُلَى, q. v.]

اِيتَسَى] He imitated him; followed his example;
did as he did, following his example, or taking
him as an example, an exemplar, a pattern, or
an object of imitation; he took example by him;
(S, Mgh, Msb, TA;) as also بِهِ ↓ تأسّى: (Msb,
TA:) he made him an object of imitation (إِسْوَة)
[to himself]. (M, K.) One says لَا تَأْتَسِ بِمَنْ,
لَيْسَ لَكَ بِإِسْوَةٍ Do not thou imitate him who is not
for thee a [fit] object of imitation. (S, M. *)
Q. Q. 1
أَسْوَيْتُهُ بِهِ [I made him to imitate him,
to follow his example, or to take example by him;]
I made him an example, an exemplar, a pattern,
or an object of imitation, to him: (M, K:) from
IAar: and if from الإِسْوَةُ, as he asserts it be, the
measure of this verb is فَعْلَيْتُ, like دَرْبَيْتُ and
جَعْبَيْتُ. (M.)

(S.) [See the verb أَسَا.]

أُسْوَةٌ: see what next follows.
إِسْوَةٌ and ↓ أُسْوَةٌ (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K) and
↓, أَسْوَةٌ, mentioned by Er-Rághib in one of his
works, (MF,) An example; an exemplar; a
pattern; an object of imitation; a person by
whom one takes example; syn. قُدْوَةٌ or قِدْوَةٌ; (S,

i. e. مَا يُؤْتَسَى بِهِ: (TA:) explained by Er-Rághib
as meaning the condition in which is a man in
respect of another's imitating [him], whether
good or bad, pleasing or hurtful: (TA:) also
a thing [or person] by which one who is
in grief, or mourning, takes example, (S, K,)
for the being consoled (لِلتَّعَزِّى) thereby: (S:)
pl. إِسًى and أُسًى; (S, K;) the former of the
first sing., and the latter of the second. (TA.)
The first of these meanings is intended in the
saying, لِى فِي فُلَانٍ إِسْوَةٌ and أُسْوَةٌ [I have in
such a one an example, &c.]. (S.) The saying,
مَا سَوِى التُّرَابِ مِنَ الأَرْضِ إِسْوَةُ التُّرَابِ is tropical,
meaning (tropical:)  There is nothing but the dust of the
earth, or ground, that follows the dust. (Mgh.)

of these three belongs, but the second and third
may be regarded as belonging either to that art.
