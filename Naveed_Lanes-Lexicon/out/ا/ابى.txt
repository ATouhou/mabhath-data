ابى1
أَبَى, aor. يَأْبَى, (S, M, Msb, K,) which is
anomalous, (S, M, Msb,) because it has no faucial
letter (S, Msb) for its second or third radical,
(Msb,) and يَأْبِى, (M, Msb, K,) mentioned by IJ
as sometimes said, (M,) agreeably with analogy,
(TA,) and يِئْبَى, which is doubly anomalous, first
because the pret. is of the measure فَعَلَ, and this
pronunciation of the ى of the aor. is [regularly
allowable only] in the case of a verb of the
measure فَعِلَ, aor. يَفْعَلُ, and secondly because it
is only in an aor. like يِيْجَلُ, (Sb, M,) i. e., of a
verb of which the first radical letter is و or ى,
(TA in art. وجل,) and يِئْبِى, (IB, [who cites as
an ex. a verse ending with the phrase حَتَّى تِئْبِيَهْ,])
inf. n. إِبَآءٌ (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K) and إِبَآءَ ةٌ, (K,)
or إِبَاةٌ, (so in a copy of the M,) or إِبَايَةٌ, (so in
the Msb,) He refused; or refrained, forbore,
abstained, or held back; syn. اِمْتَنَعَ; (S, Msb, MF,
Bd in ii. 32, Kull p. 8,) voluntarily, or of his
own free will or choice: (Bd ubi suprà, Kull:)
[thus when used intransitively: and it is also used
transitively:] you say, أَبَى الأَمْرَ he refused assent,
or consent, to the thing, or affair; disagreed to
it; and did not desire [to do] it: (Mtr in Har
p. 483:) he did not assent to, consent to, approve,
or choose, it; he disallowed it; rejected it: (Mgh:)
and أَبَي الشَّىْ ءَ he disliked, was displeased with,
disapproved of, or hated, the thing. (M, K.) Fr
says that there is no verb with fet-h to its medial
radical letter in the pret. and fut. [or aor.] unless
its second or third radical is a faucial letter, except
أَبَى: that AA adds رَكَنَ: but that one says رَكَنَ
with يَرْكُنُ for its fut., and رَكِنَ with يَرْكَنُ for
its fut.: (T:) so that the instance mentioned by
AA is one of an intermixture of two dial. vars.:
(TA:) Th adds قَلَى and غَسَا and شَجَا; and Mbr
adds جَبَا: but most of the Arabs say يَقْلِى and
يَغْسُو and يَشْجُو and يَجْبِى. (T.) [Some other
instances are mentioned by other authors; but
these are verbs of which the aors. are rarely with
fet-h, or are instances of the intermixture of two
dial. vars.] أَبَيْتَ اللَّعْنَ is a greeting which was
addressed to kings in the time of ignorance;
meaning Mayest thou refuse, or dislike, (ISk, *
S, * M, * Har p. 491,) to do a thing that would
occasion thy being cursed! (ISk, S, M;) or, to
do that for which thou wouldst deserve the being
cursed! for it implies the meaning of a prayer;
i. e., may God make thee to be of those who
dislike the being cursed! and hence it occurs
parenthetically. (Har ubi suprà.) You say also,
أَبَى أَنْ يُضَامَ [He refused, or did not submit, to
be harmed, or injured]. (T.) [And sometimes
لَا is inserted after أَنْ, and is either redundant, or
corroborative of the meaning of the verb, as in
the case of أَنَ لَا or أَلَّا after مَنَعَ.] It is said in
the Kur ix. 32, وَيَأْبَى اللّهُ إِلَّا أَنْ يُتِمَّ نَورَهُ, meaning
But God will not consent or choose [save to complete, or perfect, his light]. (Bd.) And in the
same xvii. 91, فَأَبَي أَكْثَرُ النَاسَ إِلَّا كُفُورًا, i. e.
[But the greater number of men have not consented
to, or chosen, aught] save denying [its truth, or
disbelieving it]; this phrase with إِلَّا being allowable because it is rendered by means of a negative. (Bd.) You also say, كَانَ يَأْبَى اللَّحْمَ [He
used to refuse, or dislike, flesh-meat], (K,) or
أَكْلَ اللَّحْمِ [the eating of flesh-meat]. (Mgh.)
And أَبَى فَلَانٌ المَآءِ [Such a one refused, or disliked, water, or the water]: (S:) or أَبَى مِنْ شُرْبِ
المَآءِ [he refused, or voluntarily refrained from,
the drinking of water, or the water]. (AAF, M.)
And أَبَى عَلَيْهِ الأَمَرَ, (Mgh, and Mtr. [author of the
Mgh] in Har p. 483,) and عَلَيْهِ ↓ تَأَبَّاهُ, both signify He refused him his assent, or consent, to the
thing, or affair. (Mtr ubi suprà, in Har.) Hence,
(Mtr ubi suprà,) أَبَى عَلَيْهِ, (Mgh, and Mtr ubi
suprà,) and عَلَيْهِ ↓ تَأَبَّى, (T, S, and Mtr ubi suprà,)
He was incompliant, or unyielding, to him; he
resisted him, withstood him, or repugned him;
syn. اِمْتَنَعَ (T, S, Mgh, and Mtr ubi suprà) عَلَيْهِ:
(T:) thus explained because the objective complement (الأَمْرَ) is suppressed. (Mtr ubi suprà.)
-A2-
أَبِيْتُ الطَّعَامَ, (K,) or مِنَ الطَّعَامِ, and اللَّبَنِ, (M,
TA, [in a copy of the former of which the verb is
written ابَيْتُ, but this I suppose to be a mistranscription, on account of what here follows,]) like
رَضِيْتُ, (K,) inf. n. أَبَّى, (M, and so in some
copies of the K,) or إِبَّى, (so in some copies of the
K,) with kesr, and with the short final alif, (TA,
[i.e. like رِضَّى, but perhaps this may have been
supposed to be the right reading only because the
verb is likened to رَضِيتُ, of which رِضَّى is the
most common inf. n.,]) I left, or relinquished, the
food, (M, K,) and the milk, (M, TA,) without
being satiated, or satisfied. (M, K.) ―
-b2-  أَبِىَ الفَصِيلُ,
and أُبِىَ, inf. n. أَبَّى, The young camel, or young
weaned camel, suffered indigestion from the milk,
and became affected with a dislike of food. (M,
K.)
-A3-  أَبَيْتُ as syn. with أَبَوْتُ: see the latter.

آبَيْتُهُ إِيَّاهُ [in the CK, erroneously, أَبَيْتُهُ] I
made him to refuse it; or to refrain, forbear,
abstain, or hold back, from it, voluntarily, or
of his own free will or choice: (S: [this meaning
being there implied, though not expressed:]) or
I made him to dislike it, to be displeased with it,
to disapprove of it, or to hate it: (M, K:) namely,
water [&c.]. (S, M.) One says, فُلَانٌ بَحْرٌ لَا بُؤْبِى,
(ISk, S, K, * [in the CK, erroneously, لا يُؤْبى,])
i. e., لَا يَجْعَلُكَ تَأْبَاهُ [Such a one is like a sea, or
great river, that will not make thee to refuse it,
or dislike it, &c.]; (K;) i. e., that will not fail,
or come to an end, (ISk, S, K,) by reason of its
abundance. (ISk, S.) In like manner one says,
of any water, مَآءٌ لَا يُؤْبِى [Water that will not
fail, or come to an end]. (TA.) And عِنْدَنَا مَآءٌ مَا
يُؤْبِى With us, or at our abode, is water that does
not become scanty, or little in quantity. (Lh, T,
M.) And آبَى المَآءُ The water decreased, or became deficient. (AA, from El-Mufaddal.) And
قَلِيبٌ لَا يُؤْبِى A well that will not become exhausted: (IAar, M:) one should not say, يُؤْبَى.
(M, TA.) In like manner, also, one says, كَلَأَ
لَا يُؤْبَى Herbage, or pasture, that will not fail, or
come to an end. (S.) And عِنْدَهُ دَرَاهِمُ لَا تُؤْبِى
He has dirhems, or money, that will not fail, or
come to an end. (TA.) And آبَى المَآءُ signifies
also The water [in a well] was, or became, difficult of access (اِمْتَنَعَ), so that no one was able to
descend to it but by exposing himself to peril or
destruction: (M:) if a drawer of water descend
into the well, (T, TA,) and the water be altered
for the worse in odour, (TA,) he expose himself
to peril, or destruction. (T, TA.)

latter half of the paragraph.
إِبْيَةٌ A paucity, or deficiency, and revulsion, of
the milk in the breast: (Fr, TS:) or a revulsion
of the milk in the udder; (K;) but the saying
“in the udder” requires consideration. (TA:)
You say to a woman, when she has a fever on the
occasion of childbirth, إِنَّمَا هذِهِ الحُمَّى إِبْيَةٌ ثَدْيِكَ
[This fever is only occasioned by the paucity, or
deficiency, and revulsion, of the milk in thy breast.]
(TA.)

measure فُعَالٌ, (S, M,) with damm, (S, K,) because it is like a disease, and nouns significant of

say, أَخَذَهُ أُبَآءٌ (T, S, M, K) مِنَ الطَّعَامِ (K) He
was, or became, taken, or affected, with a dislike,
or loathing, of food. (T, S, M, K.)

or repugning: (T:) and ↓ أَبْيَانُ and أَبْيَانٌ, a man
having vehement ابآء [app. أُبَآء, i. e. dislike, or

quality of words of the measure فَعْلَان]: (T, TA:
[but in copy of the T, accord. to the TT, ابآء
in this last explanation is written اِبآء: in the TA
it is without any vowel-sign:]) the pl. of آبٍ is
آبُونَ and أُبَاةٌ (M, K) and أُبِىٌّ, (K,) with damm,
then kesr, and then teshdeed, (TA, [in the CK
اُبَىّ, and in a copy of the M اُبِين,]) and أُبَّآءٌ, (M,
TA,) or إِبآءٌ, (K, TA,) like رِجَالٌ: (TA: [in the
CK اُباء:]) the pl. of ↓ أَبِىٌّ is أَبِيُّونَ; (M, K;) of
which an instance occurs wherein the pl. ن is
likened to a radical ن; the gen. case being
written, at the end of a verse, أَبيِينِ: (M:) the
pl. of ↓ أَبْيَانٌ, (M,) or أَبَيَانٌ, (K,) is إِبْيَانٌ. (Kr,
M, K.) ―

آبِيَةٌ, (M,) so in some copies of the K, but in
others ↓ أَبِيَّةٌ, (TA,) She [app. a camel] that dislikes, or loathes, and will not drink, water: and

she-camels that refuse, or refrain from, the stallion. (TA. [See also أَبِىٌّ.]) It is said in a prov.,
العَاشِيَةٌ تَهِيجُ الآبِيَةَ [She that is eating her eveningfood, or pasturing in the evening, excites her that
has no desire for that food]; i. e., when the
camels that desire not the evening-food see the

pasture with them. (M, and so in the S in art.
عشو.)
