اسن1
أَسَنَ, aor.
اَسُنَ (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K) and
اَسِنَ,
(S, M, K,) inf. n. أُسُونٌ (S, M, Msb) and أَسْنٌ;
(M;) and أَسِنَ, aor.
اَسَنَ, (S, M, &c.,) inf. n. أَسَنٌ;
(S, M, Msb;) said of water, i. q. أَجَنَ and أَجِنَ;
(S, K;) [i. e.] It became altered for the worse
(M, Mgh, Msb) in odour, (M,) [or in taste and
colour, from some such cause as long standing,
(see أَجَنَ,)] but was drinkable; (M;) or so as not
to be drunk, (Msb, TA,) thus differing from أَجَنَ
and أَجِنَ. (TA.) [See also أَصِلَ.]
أَسِنٌ: see what follows.
آسِنٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and ↓ أَسِنٌ, (S, Mgh,
Msb,) applied to water, (S, Mgh, &c.,) i. q. آجِنٌ
[and أَجِنٌ]; (S, K;) [i. e.] Altered for the worse
(Mgh, Msb) in odour, (Mgh,) [or in taste and
colour, from some such cause as long standing
but drinkable; (see above, and see آجِنٌ;)] or
so as not to be drunk, (Msb, TA,) thus differing
from آجِنٌ and أَجِنٌ: (TA:) pl. [of the former]
آسَانٌ [like as أَطْهَارٌ is pl. of طَاهِرٌ, or perhaps it
may have for its sing. أَسْنٌ, like أَجْنٌ]. (M, TA.)
مَنْ مَآءٍ غَيْرِ آسِنٍ, in the Kur [xlvii. 16], is explained by Fr as meaning Of water not altered
for the worse; not آجِن. (TA.)
