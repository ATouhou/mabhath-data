ارى1
أَرَتِ الدَّابَّةُ مَرْبَطَهَا, (M, K,) and مِعْلَفَهَا, [aor.
تَأْرِى,] inf. n. أَرْىٌ, (M,) The beast kept to its
place where it was tied, (M, K,) and to its manger. (M.) ―
-b2-  أَرَتِ الدَّابِّةُ إِلَى الدَّابَّةِ, (K,) aor.
as above, (S,) and so the inf. n., (TA,) The
beast joined itself, or became joined, to the beast,
and kept with it to one manger. (S, K.)
2
أَرَّيْتُ لِلدَّابَّةِ, (S, M, K,) and الدَّابَّةَ, (M, K,)
inf. n. تأْرِيَةٌ, (S, M, K,) I made for the beast an
آرِىّ [q. v.], (S, * M,) or an آرِيَّة. (K: [in the
CK اَرِيَّة; but this and آرِيَّة are probably mistakes
of copyists.]) ―
-b2-  أَرَّىَ الشَّىْءَ, inf. n. as above, He
rendered the thing permanent, or steadfast; confirmed it; established it. (M, K.) Hence, in
a trad., اَللٰهُمَّ أَرِّمَا بَيْنَهُمْ, i. e. O God, make permanent, or confirm, or establish, what is between
them, of love, or affection; said in praying for
a man and his wife. (M, TA.) Mohammad is
also related to have said, with this intention,
اَللٰهُمَّ أَرِّبَيْنَهُمَا, meaning O God, render permanent,
or confirm, the union, or concord, or love, of them
tow; (A'Obeyd, TA;) or cause union to subsist,
and render permanent, or confirm, love, or affection, between them two: (IAth, TA:) or اَللٰهُمَّ
أَرِّ كُلَّ وَاحِدٍ مِنْهُمَا صَاحِبَهُ, meaning O God, confine each of them two to the other, so that the
heart of neither may become turned away to any
but that other: the correct form of speech, however, is عَلَي صَاحِبِهِ, unless it be like تَعَلَّقْتُ فُلَانًا
for تعلّقت بِفُلَانٍ. (IAmb, TA.)
4
آرَيْتُ الدَّابَّةَ I joined the beast to another
beast, and made it to keep with the other to one
manger: (S, in the present art.; and K:) or
آرَيْتُ الدَّابَّتَيْنِ I joined the two beasts together,
and made them both keep to one manger. (So
accord. to the S in art. وأر.)
5
تأري بِالمَكَانِ He remained, stayed, or abode,
in the place: (S, Mgh, Msb:) or he became confined, or he confined himself, therein; (T, M, K;)
as also ↓ ائتري [written with the disjunctive alif
اِيتَرَى]. (M, K.) ―
-b2-  تأرّىعَنْهُ He remained behind
him, not going with him; held back, or hung back,

آرِىٌّ, (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) with medd and
teshdeed, (TA,) [originally آرُوىٌ,] of the measure
فَاعُولٌ, (T, S, Mgh, Msb,) from تَأَرَّى بِالمَكَانِ as

latter, the second form may be either thus (as it
is written in the M) or ↓ آرٍ, (agreeably with the
latter of the two pls. mentioned below,) for the
two forms are there expressed by الآرِىُّ وَ يُخَفَّفُ,
(in the CK, erroneously, الاَرىُّ و يُخَفَّفُ,) and in
another place in the K we find it written ↓ آرِيَّة,
or, as in the CK, ↓ اَرِيَّة,]) The place of confinement of a beast: (ISk, T, S:) or i. q. آخِيَّةٌ; (M,
Mgh, Msb, K;) used in this sense by the Arabs;
(Mgh, Msb,;) or sometimes having this application; meaning a rope to which a beast is tied in
its place of confinement;; (S;) or a loop of a rope
to which a beast is tied in that place: (Mgh:) so
called because it withholds beasts from escaping:
(TA:) sometimes, (Msb,) improperly, (ISK, T,
S,) by the vulgar, and by the lawyers, (Mgh,)
applied to a manger::(ISk, T, S, Mgh, Msb:) pl.
أَوَارِىُّ (T, S, Mgh, Msb) and أَوَارٍ (S.)
-A2-  Hence,
أَوَارِىُّ is metaphorically applied to (tropical:) The places
(أَحْيَاز) that are made, in shops, for grain and
other things: and to (tropical:)  the water-tanks, or troughs,
in a bath. (Mgh.)

[wild] bull, and his covert,
وَاعْتَادَ أَرْبَاضَّا لَهَا آرِىُّ
meaning [And he frequented lodging-places]
having a firm foundation for the quiet of the
wild animals therein [as having been from the
first occupied by such animals and unfrequented
by men]. (S.)— آرِىُّ is also said to signify
Land of a kind between even and rugged. (M.)
آرِيَّةٌ: see آرِىٌّ.
