آفَتِ البِلَادُ, aor. تَؤُوفُ, inf. n. أَوْفٌ and
آفَةٌ (M, TA) and أُوُوفٌ, (M,) or أُؤُوفٌ, (TA,)
The country, or countries, had therein what is
termed آفَة [i. e. a blight or blast or the like, or
a pest or plague or the like]. (M, TA.) And
إِيفَ الطَّعَامُ, (Ibn Buzurj, T,) or الزَّرْعُ, (K,) or
البَّشْىءُ, with the verb in the pass. form, (Msb,)
like قِيلَ, (K,) The wheat, or seed-produce, or
thing, became affected, or smitten, with what is
termed آفَة [i. e. a blight, blast, taint, canker, or
the like]. (T, K, Msb.) And آفَ القَوْمُ, (M, TA,)
and أُوفُوا, (K,) thus in a correct copy of the 'Eyn,
(TA,) and إِيفُوا, (Lth, T, K,) and أُفُوا, (K, TA,)
[in the CK اُفِّفُوا,]) and إِفُوا, (Lth, T, K, [in the
CK اُفُوا,]) the last, namely, إِفُوا, with the ا termed
مُمَالَة, having a quiescent letter [i. e. ى] rendered
apparent by utterance but not by writing, between
it and the ف, (T, K, * [in which is a strange
omission, of the words سَاكِنٌ بَيَّنَهُ اللَّفْظُ لَا الخَطُّ
as in the T, or سَاكِنَةٌ يُبَيِّنُهَا الخ as in the TA,]
TA,) The people became affected, or smitten, with
what is termed آفَة [i. e. a pest or plague or the
like]. (Lth, T, M, K.) Lth says, in this case one
says إِفُوا, and in one dial. إِيفُوا: (T:) in several
copies of his book, in one dial. أُفِّفُوا, with two
distinct ف s, of which the former is with teshdeed:
but in some copies as mentioned just before. (Sgh,
TA.)
آفَةٌ [A blight, blast, taint, canker, disease, bane,
pest, plague, or the like; any evil affection; an
evil; a cause of mischief or harm or injury; anything that is noxious or destructive; a calamity;]
i. q. عَاهَةٌ; (S, Msb, K;) i. e. (Msb, [in the K
“ or,”]) an accident that mars, or corrupts, that
which it affects, or befalls, or smites: (T, M, O,
Msb, K:) pl. آفَاتٌ. (Msb, K.) [See 1.] One
says, آفَهُ الظَّرْفِ الصَّلَفُ وَ آفَةُ العِلْمِ النِّسعيَانُ [The bane
of elegance in manners, or the like, is the overpassing the due limits therein, and arrogating to
oneself superiority therein, through pride; and
the bane of science is forgetfulness]. (T.) And it is
said in a trad., آفَةُ الحَدِيثِ الكَذِبُ وَ آفَةُ العِلْمِ النِّسْيَانُ
[The bane of discourse is lying; and the bane of
science is forgetfulness]. (TA.) And hence the
saying, لِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ آفَةٌ وَ لِلْعِلْم آفَاتٌ [To everything
there is a bane; and to science there are banes].
(TA.)
مَؤُوفٌ, (Ks, T, S, M, Msb, K,) originally
مَأْوُوفٌ, (Msb,) and ↓ مَئِيفٌ, (Ibn-Buzurj, T, K,)
Affected, or smitten, with what is termed آفَة;
(T, S, M, &c.;) applied to wheat, (Ks, Ibn-Buzurj, T, M,) or seed-produce, (S, K,) &c.
(Msb.)
مَئِيفٌ: see مَؤُوفٌ.
