استاِسْتٌ, signifying The podex, or the anus, (K,)
or signifying the former, and sometimes used as
meaning the latter, (S in art. سته,) is with a conjunctive hemzeh, [written اسْتٌ, when not immediately preceded by a quiescence,] and its final
radical letter is clided; for the original form is سَتَهٌ;
(Msb;) and it is mentioned in art. سته. (K.)
[It is of the fem. gender.] It is said in a prov.,
applied to him who fails of attaining the object
that he seeks, أَخْطَأَتِ اسْتُهُ الحُفْرَةَ [His anus
missed the hole in the ground]. (Meyd.) —
[Hence,] اِسْتُ الدَّهْرِ (tropical:)  The first, or beginning, of
time; (A;) old, or ancient, time. (IB, A, * K. *)
One says, مَا زَالَ عَلَى اسْتِ الدَّهْرِ مَجْنُونًا (tropical:)  [He
ceased not, or has not ceased, from the beginning
of time, or from old time, to be insane, or mad;
or] he always was, or always has been, known as
being insane, or mad: like as one says, عَلَى إِسِّ
الدَّهْرِ. (AZ, S.) And Aboo-Nukheyleh says,
مَا زَالَ مُذْ كَانَ عَلَى ا سْتِ الدَّهْرِ
ذَا حُمُقٍ يَنْمِى وَعَقْلٍ يَحْرشى
(tropical:)  [He ceased not, or has not ceased, to be, since
he was in the beginning of time, or in old time,
i. e., from the first of his existence, a person of
increasing foolishness, and of decreasing intellect].
(AZ, S.) IB says, J has erred in mentioning
است in this section [of the S]; its proper place
being in art. سته, where he has also mentioned
it; for its hemzeh is conjunctive, by common
consent; and if conjunctive, it is augmentative:
also, his saying that they have changed the [final]
س in إِسٌّ into ت, like as they have changed the
[final] س of طَسٌّ into ت, making this word طَسْتٌ,
is a mistake; for, were it so, the hemzeh of است
would be disjunctive [in every case; whereas it is
always conjunctive except after a pause, when
it is pronounced with kesr]: moreover, he has
attributed this assertion to AZ, who never made
it, but only mentioned است الدهر with اسّ الدهر
because of their agreement in meaning. (TA.)

أُسْتِىٌّ The warp of cloth; (K;) as also أُسْدِىٌّ
and أُزْدِىٌّ: (TA:) but it is improperly mentioned

measure أُفْعُولٌ. (K.)
اِسْتِىٌّ Of, or relating to, the اِسْت. (TA in art.
سته.)
