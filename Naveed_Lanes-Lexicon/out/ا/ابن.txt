ابن1
أَبَنَهُ, aor.
اَبُنَ and
اَبِنَ, inf. n. أَبْنٌ, He made him
an object of imputation, or suspected him: and
he found fault with him, or blamed him: (M:)
or he cast a foul, or an evil, imputation upon him.
(IAar, T.) You say, أَبَنَهُ بِشَىْءٍ, (S, K,) or بِشَّرٍ
(as in one copy of the S,) or بِخَيْرٍوَشَّرٍ, (Lh, M,)
aor. as above, (Lh, S, M, K,) and so the inf. n.,
(Lh, M,) He made him an object of imputation,
or suspected him, (Lh, S, M, K,) of a thing, (S,
K,) or of evil, (S, accord. to one copy,) or of good,
and evil: (Lh, M:) and ↓ أبّنهُ signifies the same.
(M.) And بِخَيْرٍ ↓ فُلَانٌ يُؤَبَّنُ, or بِشَّرٍ, Such a
one is made an object of imputation, or suspected,
of good, or of evil: (AA, * Lh, T [as in the TT;
but perhaps يُؤَبَّنُ is a mistranscription for يُؤْبَنُ;
for it is immediately added, فَهُوَ مَأْبُونٌ:]) when,
however, you say يؤبن [i. e. يُؤْبَنُ or ↓ يُؤَبَّنٌ]
alone, it relates to evil only. (AA, T. [But
see 2.]) And فُلَانٌ يَؤَبَنُ بِكَذَا, or ↓ يُؤَبَّنُ, Such a
one is evil spoken of by the imputation of such
a thing. (S, accord. to different copies.) And
it is said respecting the assembly of the Prophet,
فِيهِ الحُرَمُ, ↓ لَا تُؤَبَّنُ, (T, and so in a copy of the
S,) or لا تُؤْبَنُ, (so in some copies of the S,) i. e.
Women (T) shall not be mentioned in an evil
manner therein: (T, S:) or shall not have evil
imputations cast upon them, nor be found fault
with, nor shall that which is foul be said of them,
nor that which ought not, of things whereof one
should be ashamed. (IAar, T.) ―
-b2-  Also, and
↓ أبّنهُ, (M, K,) inf. n. تَأْبِينٌ, (K,) He found fault
with him, or blamed him, to his face; (M, K;)
and he upbraided him, or reproached him. (M.)
2
أبّن الشَّىْءَ, (AZ, S,) inf. n. تَأْبِينٌ, (K,) He
watched, or observed, the thing; or he expected it,
or waited for it. (AZ, S, K.) ―
-b2-  أبّن الأَثَرَ, (M,)
inf. n. as above, (As, T, S, K,) He followed the
traces, or footprints, or footsteps, (As, T, S, M,
K,) of a thing; (As, S, K;) as also ↓ تأبّن.
(K.) And hence the next signification. (As,
T.)
-A2-  أبّن الرَّجُلَ, (S, M,) inf. n. as above, (Sh,
T, S, K,) He praised the man, or spoke well
of him, (Sh, Th, T, S, M, K,) after his death,
(Th, S, M, K,) or in death and in life, (Sh, T,)
used in poetry to signify praise of the living;
(M;) and wept for him: (S:) he praised him;
and enumerated, or recounted, his good qualities
or actions: you say, لَمْ يَزَلَ يُقَرِّظُ أَحْيَاكُمْ وَيُؤَبِّنُ
مَوْتَاكُمْ [He ceased not to eulogize your living
and to praise your dead]: (Z, TA:) for he who
praises the dead traces his [good] deeds. (As,
T.) ―

branch in a bow, (M,) which is a fault therein;
(TA;) and in a rope, or cord: (M in art. اثل:)
pl. أُبَنٌ. (T, S.) ―
-b2-  Hence, (M,) (tropical:)  A fault,

grounds of pretension to respect, (T, TA,) and in
speech, or language. (M, TA.) ―

instance, of fruit, (S, Mgh, Msb,) of the fresh ripe

You say, أَخَذَ الشَّىْءَ بِإِبَّانِهِ He took the thing in
its time: or in, or with, the first thereof. (M.)
The ن is radical, so that it is of the measure فِعَّالٌ;
or, as some say, augmentative, so that it is of the
measure فِعْلَانٌ. (TA.) [See art. اب.]
مُؤَبَّنٌ occurs as meaning Dead, or dying; i. e.,
[properly,] wept for. (S.) [See 2.]
مُؤَبِّنٌ A praiser of the dead; because he traces
his [good] deeds. (As, T.)
مَأْبُونٌ Made an object of imputation, or suspected, of evil: thus when used alone: otherwise
you add بِخَيْرٍ [of good], and بِشَّرٍ [of evil]. (M,
K.) ―
-b2-  Hence, [A catamite;] one with whom
enormous wickedness is committed; (TA;) i. q.
مُخَنَّثٌ. (Idem, voce دُعْبُوثٌ.) ―

[i. e. أَبْنُوسٌ,] and without و, [app. أَبْنُسٌ,] (Msb,)
[Ebony;] a thing well known, which is brought
from India: an arabicized word: (Msb [in
which is added the proper Arabic appellation;
but the word in my copy of that work is imperfectly written; app. جعفر; which, however, does
not seem to be the word intended:]) some say
that it is the same as سَاسَم: others, that it is
different therefrom: and respecting the measure
of the word, authors differ. (TA.)
