انى1
أَنَى, (S, M, K,) aor. يَأْنِى, (S,) inf. n. إِنٌى
(S, M, K) and أَنْىٌ and أَنَآءٌ, (M, K,) or, accord.
to [some of the copies of] the M, أَنًى, (TA, [in
which this is said to be the right form,]) or أَنًا,
(as written in the CK,) said of a thing, Its time
came; or it was, or became, or drew, near;
syn. أَتَى وَقْتُهُ, and جَآءَ أَنَاهُ; (Bd lvii. 15 [in
explanation of a passage cited voce أَنْ];) or حَانَ:
(S, M, K:) or أَنَى, aor. يَأْنِى, inf. n. أَنْىٌ, signifies it was, or became, or drew, near; and it was,
or became, present. (Msb.) You say, أَنَى لَكَ
أَنْ تَفْعَلَ, aor. يَأْنِى; and آنَ, aor. يَئِينُ; and
نَالَ لك, aor. يَنِيلُ; and أَنَالَ; all meaning
حَانَ لَكَ [The time has come, or has drawn near,
for thee that thou shouldst do such a thing: or
the time of thy doing such a thing has come to
thee: or thy doing such a thing has drawn near]:
so says Zj; and Fr says the like: but the best
of these is أَنَى لَكَ. (T.) And أَنَى الرَّحِيلُ The
time of departure came, or drew near; syn. حَانَ
وَقْتُهُ. (TA, from a trad.) ―
-b2-  It came, or attained,
to its time; to its full, or final, time or state;
to maturity, or ripeness; it became mature, or
ripe; (T, S, M, IAmb, * Msb, * K;) or, accord.
to some, only when said of a plant; (M, K;) [or
it signifies also] it became thoroughly cooked.
(T, Msb. *) Hence, in the Kur [xxxiii. 53],
غَيْرَنَاظِرِينَ إِنَاهُ Not waiting, or watching, for
its becoming thoroughly cooked; or for its cooking becoming finished. (T, S, * M.) [See also إِنًى,
below.] You say also, أَنَى الحَمِيمُ, (inf. n. أَنْىٌ,
TA,) The hot water became heated to the utmost
degree. (S, K.) And أَنَى المَآءُ The water became
hot to the utmost degree. (M.)
-A2-  أَنَى, aor. أُنِىٌّ,
inf. n. أَنْىٌ, It (a thing) was, or became, behind,
or after, its time: (Lth, T:) or أَنَى, inf. n. أُنِىٌّ,
it, or he, (a man, TA,) was, or became, behind,
backward, or late; it, or he, delayed, or held
back; (M, K;) as also أَنِىَ, aor. يَأْنَى, inf. n.
إِنًى; and ↓ أَنَّى, inf. n. تَأْنِيَةٌ. (K.) ―
-b2-  See also 5,
in two places.

اَنَّىَ see 4, in two places:
-A2-  and see 1. ―
-b2-  You
say also, أَنَّيْتُ فِى الشَّىْءِ I fell short, or fell short
of what was requisite or what I ought to have
done, or flagged, or was remiss, in, or in respect
of, the thing. (TA. [The verb is there written
without any syll. signs; but the context seems
to indicate that it is as above.])
4
آنى and ↓ أنّى signify the same. (IAar, T,
M.) You say, آنَاهُ, (T, S, M, Msb, K,) with
medd, (Msb,) aor. يُؤْنِيهِ, (S,) inf. n. إِينَآءٌ, (S, K,)
[in the CK, اَنَيْتُهُ اِنْيًا is erroneously put for آنَيْتُهُ
إِينَآءٌ,] He postponed it, put it off, deferred it, delayed it, retarded it; (T, S, M, Msb, K;) retrained
it, withheld it, impeded it; (S, TA;) whatever
the thing be. (T.) And الطَّعَامَ فِى النَّارِ ↓ أَنَّيْتُ I
kept the food long upon the fire. (TA.) And
لَا تُؤْنِ فُرْصَتَكَ Postpone not thou, or defer not,
thine opportunity, or the time when thou art able
to do a thing. (T.) And it is said in a trad.,
respecting the prayer of Friday, رَأَيْتُكَ آنَيْتَ وَآذَيْتَ
(M, * Mgh, * TA) I see thee to have delayed
coming, and to have done what is annoying to
others by stepping over the necks [of those already
in their places in the mosque]: (As, Mgh, * TA:)
a saying of 'Omar. (Mgh.)
-A2-  آنَاهُ also signifies
He made him, or it, to be distant, remote, or far
off; removed far away, alienated, or estranged,
him, or it; like أَنْآهُ [from which it is formed by
transposition]. (TA.) [Hence,] يُؤْنِيكَ occurs in a
verse of Es-Sulameeyeh; (M, TA;) meaning
يُنْئِيكَ; the ء being put before the ن (M.)
5
تأنّى He acted deliberately, or leisurely,
not hastily; as also ↓ استأنى; and ↓ أَنِىَ, (M, K,)
aor. يَأْنَى, (K,) inf. n. أنْىٌ: (TA:) he acted with
moderation, gently, deliberately, or leisurely;
without haste; and with gravity, staidness, sedateness, or calmness; فِى الأَمْرِ in the affair;
as also ↓ استأنى: (Mgh:) or he acted gently;
(IAar, T, TA;) as also ↓ أَنِىَ, aor. and inf. n. as
above: (TA:) or he acted gently, and waited;
فِى الأَمْرِ in the affair: (S:) or he waited, or
was patient, or waited with patience, (T, Msb,)
and did not hasten, in an affair. (Msb.) التَّأَتِّى
and التَّأَنِّى are nearly syn.: you say, تأنّى لَهُ He
acted gently with him, [or to him,] and did not
hasten in his affair. (Mgh.) You say also,
بِهِ ↓ استأنى He waited patiently with him; or
waited, and had patience, with him; (S, TA;)
he did not hasten him; (Lth, T;) as also ↓ استأناهُ.
('Eyn, Har p. 67.) And بِهِ حَوْلًا ↓ اُسْتُؤْنِىَ [He
was waited patiently with for a year]. (S.) And
فِى أَمْرِكَ ↓ اِسْتَأْنِ Hasten not in thine affair.
(Lth, T.) And فِى الطَّعَامِ ↓ اِسْتَأْنَيْتُ I waited
for the food to become perfectly prepared or
cooked. (Har p. 67.) And تَأَنَّيْتُ الرَّجُلَ (and
عَلَيْهِ, M and K in art. نظر, [see اِنْتَظَرَهُ,]) I
waited for the man; as also بِهِ ↓ اِسْتَأْنَيْتُ: whence,
بِالْجِرَاحَاتِ ↓ يُسْتَأنَى One should wait for the issues,
or consequences, or results, of wounds. (Mgh.)
And تَأنَّيْتُكَ حَتَّى لَا أَنَاةَ بِى [I have waited
patiently for thee until there is no disposition
to wait patiently in me]. (S.)

إِسْتَاْنَىَ see 5, passim.
أَنْىٌ: see what next follows.
إِنْىٌ (AO, T, S, M, Msb, K) and ↓ إِنًى, (Akh,
T, S, Msb,) the latter in [some of] the copies of
the K erroneously written أَنَآءٌ, (TA,) [and in
other copies of the same omitted,] and ↓ إِنْوٌ,
(Akh, Th, T, S, M, K,) with و substituted for ى,

I Amb,) An hour, or a short portion, or a time,
or an indefinite time, (سَاعَةٌ,) of the night: (Zj,
T, S, M, K:) or a time or season (وَقْتٌ) of the
night: (M in art. انو:) or i. q. وَهْنٌ [the period
about midnight; or the time after an hour, or a
short period, of the night; or when the night is
departing]: (M, K:) or any سَاعَة [i. e. hour, or
short portion, or time,] (M, K) of the night:
(M:) [and any period of time; as will be seen
below:] or, accord. to some, (M,) ↓ إِنًى signifies
the whole day; (M, K;) as also ↓ أَنًى: (K:)
the pl. is آنَآءٌ (T, S, M, Msb, K) and أُنىٌّ and
إِنِىٌّ. (M, K.) You say, مَضَى إِنْىٌ مِنَ الَّيْلِ and
↓ إِنْوٌ [&c.] A time, or season, [&c.,] (وَقْتٌ,
[&c.,]) of the night passed: (M in art. انو:)
dual إِنْيَانِ and إِنْوَانِ. (S.) And a poet says,
أَتَمَّتْ حَمْلَهَا فِى بَعْضِ شَهْرٍ
وَحَمْلُ الحَامَلَاتِ إنًى طَوِيلُ
[She completed her gestation in a portion of a
month; but the gestation of the pregnant in
general is a long period of time]. (IAar, T.)
Another uses the phrase ضَحَّاكُ الأُنِىْ, occurring
at the end of a verse, [for ضحّاك الأُنِىِّ,] meaning
Found to be laughing whenever one comes to him.
(M.)
أَنًى: see إِنْىٌ, in two places. ―
-b2-  The utmost
point, reach, or degree, (M, K,) of a thing; (M;)
as also ↓ إِنًى: so in the phrase, بَلَغَ أَنَاهُ and إِنَاهُ
It (a thing, M) attained its utmost point, reach,
or degree: (M, K:) or this means, [or, accord.
to the CK, “and” it means,] its state of being
thoroughly cooked; its state of maturity; or its
full, or final, time or state. (K.) [See 1, where
an ex. from the Kur xxxiii. 53 is cited. Both
words are said to be inf. ns.]
-A2-  See also أَنَاةٌ.
إِنًى: see إِنِىٌ, in two places: ―
-b2-  and see أَنًى.
أَنَآءٌ [Postponement; a putting off; a deferring;
a delaying; a retarding: restraint; a withholding; an impeding:] a subst. from آنَاهُ, aor. يُؤْنِيهِ,
inf. n. إِينَآءٌ, meaning “he postponed it,” &c.: (S,
Msb, * TA:) the context of the K erroneously
requires it to be understood as a subst. from أَنَى,
aor. يَأْنى. (TA.)
إِنَآءٌ A certain thing of which one makes use,
(M,) well known; (S, K;) namely, a vessel, or
receptacle, (Mgh, Msb,) for water [&c.]: (Mgh:)
pl. آنِيَةٌ, (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) originally أَأْنِيَةٌ;
(M;) and أَوَانٍ; (T, S, M, Mgh, K;) the former
a pl. of pauc.; and the latter a pl. of mult., (Mgh,)
pl. of آنِيَةٌ. (T, S, M.)
أَنَاةٌ Moderation; gentleness; deliberateness; a
leisurely manner of proceeding, or of deportment,
&c.; patience, as meaning contr. of hastiness:
and gravity; staidness; sedateness; calmness: a
subst. from تَأَنَّى; (S, Msb;) syn. تُؤَدَةٌ; (T;) and
رِفْقٌ; (Ham p. 317;) and حِلْمٌ and وَقَارٌ; (M, Mgh,
K;) as also ↓ أنًى. (M, K, TA. [In the CK,
كالاَنْىِ is erroneously put for كَالأَنَى.]) ―
-b2-  Also
Hope: [in this sense, accord. to the TA, written
with kesr; but this is doubtless a mistake, probably occasioned by a mistranscription:] so in
the charge of 'Orweh to his sons; يَا بَنِىَّ إِذَا رَأَيْتُمْ
خَلَّةً رَائِعَةً مِنْ رَجُلٍ فَلَا تَقْطَعُوا أَنَاتَكُمْ مِتْهُ وَإِنْ
كَانَ عِنْدَ النَّاسِ رَجُلَ سَؤْءٍ [O my sons, when ye see
a quality exciting admiration and approval, in a
man, cut not ye off your hope of him, though he
be in the estimation of the people a bad man].
(M.)
-A2-  A woman in whom is a languor on the
occasion of rising, or standing up; (T, S, K;)
and a gentle, or grave, deportment: (S:) or in
whom is a languor impeding from rising, or
standing up: (As:) and وَهْنَانَةٌ signifies the like:
(T:) Sb says that it is originally وَنَاةٌ, like as أَحَدٌ
is originally وَحَدٌ; from الوَنَى: (S:) the people
of El-Koofeh say that it is only وَنَاةٌ: so says Lth:
and he says that أَنَاةٌ signifies, as applied to a
woman, blessed, prospered, or abounding in good,
as it is explained also by ADk, and forbearing,
gentle, grave, staid, sedate, or calm, and compliant,
or agreeing with another in mind or opinion: and
the pl. is أَنَواتٌ: or, as some say, it signifies a
grave, staid, sedate, or calm, woman, who does
not clamour, nor utter foul language. (T.)
أَنِىٌّ, as part. n. of 1, A thing of which the time
has come, or drawn near: and which has come,
or attained, to its time; to its full, or final, time
or state; to maturity, or ripeness: but accord.
to some, only applied to a plant. (M, K.) [Compare آنٍ.]
-A2-  Behind, or after, the time; backward, or late; delayed, or held back; (K, TA;
[but wanting in a MS. copy of the former in my
possession, and in the CK;]) as also ↓ آنٍ. (TA.)
إٍنِيهْ a word expressive of disapproval, and of
deeming a thing remote or improbable: Sb relates
that it was said to an Arab of the desert, who had
taken up his abode in a town, or place, “Wilt
thou go forth when the desert shall have become
plentiful in herbage?” and he said, أَأَنَا إِنِيهْ [What,
I, indeed?], meaning “Do ye say this to me when
I am know to do thus?” as though he disapproved of their questioning him: but there is
much diversity of opinion respecting this word:
(TA:) [accord. to some,] it is composed of the
redundant إِنْ and the meddeh denoting disapproval [followed by the ه of silence]. (Mughnee
voce إِنٌ.) [See what is said of the redundant انْ
in the present work.]
أَنَّى signifies Whence? syn. مِنْ أَيْنَ; (T, S,
M;) being an interrogative respecting the direction, or quarter, from which a thing is: (Msb:)
and whence [used to denote a condition]: (TA:)
and where? and where [used to denote a condition]; syn. أَيْنَ: (T, K: [in which latter the first
signification is not mentioned:]) and as one of
the adverbial nouns used to denote a condition,
whencesoever; from whatever direction or quarter:
(S:) and wherever; wheresoever: (Lth, T:) and
when? and when [used to den a condition];
syn. مَتَى: (T, K: [but in the latter of these, in
art. ان, in the place of مَتَى we find حَيْثُ, which
I regard as a mistake:]) and how? syn. كَيْفَ:
(Lth, T, S, M, K:) and however. (Lth, TA.) [I
mention all these significations together because
one of them is assigned by some authorities and
another by others to انّى in one and the same
instance.] You say, أَنَّى يَكُونُ هٰذَا Whence, from
what direction or quarter, from what way, will,
or should, be this? (Msb.) And أَنَّى لَكَ هٰذَا
Whence [came, or cometh,] to thee this? (S.) It
is said in the Kur [iii. 32], يَا مَرْيَمُ أَنَّى لَكِ هٰذَا
O Mary, whence [came] to thee this? (T.) And
in the same [xxxiv. 51], وَأَنَّى لَهُمُ التَّنَاوُشُ مِنْ
مَكَانٍ بَعِيدٍ, meaning [But] whence [shall the
attaining of belief be possible to them from a
distant place, i. e., (as explained in the S in art.
نوش,) in the world to come, when they have disbelieved in the present world? or but how &c.?].
(T.) And in the same [1xxx. 25], accord. to one
reading, أَنَّى صَبَبْنَا المَآءَ صَبَّا, meaning Where have
we poured forth the water, pouring? but in this
is an allusion to the direction [whence the rain
comes]; and it may be rendered whence? &c.; and
accord. to this reading, the pause upon طَعَامِهٌ
[immediately preceding] is complete. (IAmb,
T.) And you say, أَنَّى تَأْتِنِى آتِكَ, (S, K,) meaning
Whencesoever, or from whatever direction or
quarter, thou shalt come to me, I will come to
thee. (S.) In the saying of 'Alkameh,
وَمُطْعَمُ الغُنْمِ يُوْمَ الغُنْمِ مُطْعَمُهُ
أَنَّى تَوَجَّهَ وَالمَحْرُومُ مَحْرُومُ
the meaning is, [And he who is given spoil to
enjoy, (lit., who is fed therewith,) on the day of
spoil, is given it to enjoy] wherever he repairs, or
however he repairs, [and the prohibited is prohibited.] (Lth, T, TA.) The saying in the Kur
[iii. 159], قُلْتُمٌ أَنَّى هٰذَا means Ye say, When is
this? or How is this? (T,) or Whence is this?
(T, Bd, Jel.) And أَنَّى شئْتُمْ, in the same, [ii. 223,]
may mean Whence, or when, or how, ye will.
(TA.) You say also, أَنَّى لَكَ أَنْ تَفْتَحَ الحِصْنَ,
meaning How [is it, or will it be, possible for thee
to open, or conquer, the fortress]? (S.)
آنٍ Hot, or heated, to the utmost degree: applied
to hot water, (S, M, K,) in the Kur lv. 44: (S,
M:) fem. آنِيَةٌ; occurring in the Kur lxxxviii. 5.
M.)
-A2-  See also أَنِىٌّ.
-A3-  Also A man much characterized by moderation, gentleness, or deliberateness; by a leisurely manner of proceeding, or of
deportment, &c.; by patience, as meaning contr.
of hastiness; by gravity, staidness, sedateness, or
calmness. (S, K. *)
أَتَيْتُهُ آنِيَةً بَعْدَ آنِيَةٍ is a phrase mentioned by
AAF, meaning I came to him time after time:
in which, [says ISd,] I am of opinion that آنية is
of the measure فَاعِلَةٌ from الإنَى: but the word
commonly known is آوِنَة [pl. of أَوَانٌ; or آيِنَة,
which is syn. with آوِنَة: see أَوَانٌ]. (M.)
