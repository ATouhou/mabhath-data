امه1
أَمِهَ, aor.
اَمَهَ, inf. n. أَمَهٌ, He forgot. (S, K.)
Hence the reading of I'Ab, [in the Kur xii. 45,]
وَادَّكَرَ بَعْدَ أَمَهٍ [And he remembered, or became
reminded, after forgetting]. (S.) AHeyth is said
to have read بَعْدَ أَمْهٍ; and accord. to AO, أَمْهٌ
signifies نِسْيَانٌ [like أَمَهٌ]; but this is not correct.
(Az, TA.) ―
-b2-  He confessed, or acknowledged:
(S, K:) occurring in this sense in a trad. of
Ez-Zuhree; but not well known. (S.) The reading of I'Ab, mentioned above, بَعْدَ أَمَهٍ, is
explained by A'Obeyd as meaning after confessing, or acknowledging. (TA.)
5
تأمّه أُمَّا He adopted a mother; (M, K;)
as also تَأَمَّمَهَا. (M in art. ام.)
أُمَّهَةٌ i. q. أُمٌّ [A mother of a human being and
of any animal]: (M, K:) the former is [said
by some to be] the original of the latter: (S:)
Aboo-Bekr says that the ه in the former is a
radical letter: (TA:) or the former applies to a
rational creature; and the latter, to [a rational
and] an irrational: (K:) or, accord. to Az, the
pl. of the former applies to the rational; and
that of the latter, to the irrational: (TA:) the
former sing. sometimes applies to an irrational
creature: (IJ, TA:) [for some further remarks
on both of these words and their pls., see the
latter of them:] the pl. [of the former] is أُمَّهَاتٌ
and [that of the latter is] أُمَّاتٌ: (T, S:) Az says
that the امو is added in the former for the purpose
of distinguishing between the daughters of Adam
[to whom it is generally applied] and other animate
beings. (TA.)
أَمَتْ
1
آمَتْ, (S, * M, K, [in the CK, erroneously,
آمَتْ,]) second pers. أَمَوْتِ; (S;) and أَمِيَتْ, (M,
K,) like سَمِعَتْ; (K;) and أَمُوَتْ, (Lh, M, K,)
like كَرُمَتٌ; (K;) inf. n. أُمُوَّةٌ; (S, M, K;)
She (a woman) became a slave; (S, * M, K;) as
also ↓ تَأَمَّتْ. (Msb.)
-A2-  أَمَتِ السِّنَّوْرُ, aor. تَأْمُو,
inf. n. أُمَآءٌ, The cat [mewed, or] uttered a cry;
(S, K;) like مَآءَ تْ, aor. تَمُوْءُ, inf. n. مُوَآءٌ. (S.)
2
أَمَّاهَا, (M, K,) inf. n. تَأْمِيَةٌ, (K,) He made
her a slave. (M, K.)
5
تَأَمَّتُ: see 1.
-A2-  تأمّى أَمَةً He took for himself a female slave; (S, M, Msb, K;) as also
↓ اِسْتَأْمَاهَا. (S, K.)
8
هُوَيَأْتَمِى بِهِ He follows his (another person's)
example; imitates him; i. q. يَأْتَمُّ بِهِ (TA in
the present art.) And ائتمى بِالشَّىْءِ [written with
the disjunctive alif اِيتَمَى] is used for ائتَمَّ بِهِ
[He made the thing to be a rule of life or conduct],
by substitution [of ى for م], (M and K in
art. ام,) the doubling [of the م] being disapproved. (M in that art.)

إِسْتَاْ^َََ see 5.
أَمَةٌ, originally اموة, (Msb,) [but whether أَمَوَةٌ
or أَمْوَةٌ is disputed, as will be seen in what follows,]
A female slave; (M, K;) a woman whose condition is that of slavery; (T;) contr. of حُرَّةٌ:
(S:) [in relation to God, best rendered a handmaid:] dual أَمَتَانِ: (Msb:) pl. آمٍ, (Lth, T, S,
M, Msb, K, &c.,) like قِاضٍ, (Msb,) a pl. of pauc.
[respecting which see what follows after the other
pls.], (Lth, T,) and إِمَآءٌ [the most common form]
(T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K) and إِمْوَانٌ (T, S, M,
Msb, K) and أُمْوَانٌ (K, and so in some copies
of the M) and أَمْوَانٌ (K, and so in some copies
of the M) [the last, or last but one, accord. to
different copies of the M, on the authority of
Lh,] and أَمَوَاتٌ, (M, Msb, K,) for which one
may say أَمَاتٌ. (Ibn-Keysán, TA.) Accord. to
Sb (M) and Mbr (TA) it is originally أَمَوَةٌ, (S,
M, K,) because it has for a pl. آمٍ, (S, M,) which
is [originally أَأْمُوٌ,] of the measure أَفْعُلٌ, (Lth,
T, S,) like آكُمٌ, pl. of أَكَمَةٌ, (Sb, M,) and like
أَيْنُقٌ, [pl. of نَاقةٌ, which is originally نَوَقةٌ,] for a
sing. of the measure فَعْلَةٌ has not a pl. of this
form; (S;) and Mbr says that there is no noun
of two letters but a letter has been dropped from
it, which it indicates by its pl. or dual, or by
a verb if it is derived therefrom: (TA:) or it is
originally فَعْلَةٌ: (AHeyth, T, K:) AHeyth says
that they suppressed its final radical letter, and,
forming a pl. from it after the manner of نَخْلَةٌ
and نَخْلٌ, instead of saying أَمٌ, which they disliked as being of only two letters, they transposed
the suppressed و, changing it into ا, and placing
it between the ا and م. (T: [in which this
opinion, though it does not account for the termination of the pl. آمٍ, is said to be preferable.])
One says, جَآءَ تْنِىً أَمَةُ اللّٰهِ [The handmaid of God
came to me]: and in the dual, جَآءَ تْنِى أمَتَا اللّٰهِ:
and in the pl., جَآءَ نِى إِمَآءُ اللّٰهِ and إِمْوَانُ اللّٰهِ and
أَمَوَاتُ اللّٰهِ; and one may also say, أَمَاتُ اللّٰه.
(Ibn-Keysán, TA.) [ISd says,] وَمَاهُ اللّٰهُ مِنْ كُلِّ
أَمَةٍ بحَجَرٍ is mentioned by IAar as said in imprecating evil on a man; but I think it is من كلّ
أَمْتِ [May God cast a stone at him from every
elevated place, or the like]. (M.)
أَمَوِىُّ Of, or relating or belonging to, a female
slave. (S.)
أُمَيَّةٌ dim. of أَمَةٌ; (S, Msb;) originally أُمَيْوَةٌ.
(Msb.)
