أَيِسَ مِنْهُ, (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor. يَأْيَسُ
(S, Msb, K) and يَأْيِسُ, (Msb,) inf. n. أَيَسٌ, (Msb,)
or إِيَاسٌ, (K,) or it has the same inf. n. as يَئِسَ,
namely يَأْسٌ, (S,) with which ↓ إِيَاسٌ is syn.,
(Mgh,) but this last is a contraction of إِيآسٌ, of
the measure إِيعَاسٌ, as determined by Az, and is
not an inf. n. of أَيِسَ as some think it to be,
(Mgh, art. يئِس,) He despaired of it; syn. قنِط:
(K:) a dial. var. of يَئِسَ: (ISk, S, TA:) or it is
not so, but is formed by transposition from يَئِسَ,
because it has no [proper] inf. n.; and إِيَاسٌ, the
proper name of a man, is not to be adduced in
evidence, for it is of the measure فِعَالٌ from الأَوْسُ,
“ the act of giving: ” (Preface to the M, quoted
in the TA:) if it were a dial. var. of يَئِسَ, they
would say إِسْتُ for أَيِسْتُ: (M, TA:) and أُيِسَ,
incorrectly written أُويسَ, also signifies the same.
