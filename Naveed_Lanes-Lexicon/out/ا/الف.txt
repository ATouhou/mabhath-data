اَلَفَ, (S, Msb,
K,) inf. n. إِلُفٌ (S, M, Msb, K) and أَلْفٌ (K) and
إِلَافٌ and وِلَافٌ, which is anomalous, and أَلَفَانٌ,
(M, TA,) He kept, or clave, to it; (A'Obeyd,
T, M, Msb, * TA;) namely, a thing, (A'Obeyd,
T, M, TA,) or a place; (S, Msb, TA;) as also
أَلَفَهُ, aor.
اَلِفَ; (TA;) and ↓ آلفهُ, (A'Obeyd, T, S,
M, Msb,) aor. يُؤْلِفُ (S, TA,) inf. n. إِيلَافٌ; (S,
Msb, TA;) and ↓ آلفهُ, aor. يُؤَالِفُ, inf. n. مُؤَالَفَةٌ
and إِلَافٌ: (S, Msb, TA:) [he frequented it, or
resorted to it habitually; namely, a place:] he
became familiar with it; or accustomed, or habituated, to it; namely, a thing: (AZ, T:) he
became familiar, sociable, companionable, friendly,
or amicable, with him: (AZ, T, Msb:) he loved,
or affected, him; liked, approved, or took pleasure
in, him. (Msb.) You say, أَلِفَتِ الطَّيْرُ الحَرَمَ [The
birds kept to the sacred territory], and البُيُوتَ
[the houses]: and الظِّبَآءُ الرَّمْلِ ↓ آلَفَتِ The gazelles
kept to the sands. (T.) ―
-b2-  There are three manners of reading the passage in the Kur [evi. 1
and 2], CCC قُرَيْشٍ إِيلَافِهِمْ رِحْلَةَ الشِّتَآءِ وَ الصَّيْفِ ↓ لِإِيلَافِ;
the second and third being لِإِلَافِ and لِإِلْفِ; the
first and second of which have been adopted;
(Aboo-Is-hák, T, TA;) and the third also; this
being the reading of the Prophet [himself]: (TA:)
[accord. to all these readings, the passage may be
rendered, For the keeping of Kureysh, for their
keeping to the journey of the winter and of the
summer, or spring; the chapter going on to say,
for this reason "let them worship the Lord of this
House," &c. : or] the second and third readings
are from أَلِفَ, aor. يَأْلَفُ; [and accord. to these
readings, the passage may be rendered as above;]
but accord. to the first reading, the meaning is,
for the preparing and fitting out [&c.; i. e.,
preparing and fitting out men and beasts in the
journey of the winter &c.]: so says IAmb; and
Fr explains in the same manner the third reading:
but IAar says that, accord. to this reading, the
meaning is, the protecting [&c.]: he says that
the persons who protected were four brothers,
Háshim and 'Abd-Shems and El-Muttalib and
Nowfal, the sons of 'Abd-Menáf: these gave protection to Kureysh in their procuring of corn:
(T:) Háshim obtained a grant of security from
the king of the Greeks, and Nowfal from Kisrà,
and 'Abd-Shems from the Nejáshee, and ElMuttalib from the kings of Himyer; and the
merchants of Kureysh used to go to and from the
great towns of these kings with the grants of
security of these brothers, and none opposed
them: Háshim used to give protection (يُؤْلِفُ [in
the copies of the K يُؤَلِّفُ]) [to those journeying]
to Syria, and 'Abd-Shems to Abyssinia, and ElMuttalib to El-Yemen, and Nowfal to Persia:
(T, K: *) or ↓ إِيلَاف in the Kur signifies a covenant,
or an obligation; and what resembles permission,
(إِجَازَة, as in some copies of the K and in the TA,)
or protection, (إِجَارَة, as in the CK,) with an
obligation involving responsibility for safety;
first obtained by Háshim, from the kings of
Syria; (K, * TA;) and the explanation is, that
Kureysh were dwelling in the sacred territory,
(K,) having neither seed-produce nor udders [to
yield them milk], (TA,) secure in the procuring
of their provisions from other parts, and in their
changes of place, in winter and summer, or spring;
the people around them having their property
seized; whereas, when any cause of mischief
occurred to them, they said, "We are people of
the sacred territory," and then no one opposed
them: (K:) so in the O: (TA:) or the ل is to
denote wonder; and the meaning is, wonder ye
at the ايلاف of Kureysh [&c.]: (K:) some say
that the meaning is connected with what follows;
i. e., let them worship the Lord of this House for
the ايلاف [&c., agreeably with the first explanation which we have given]: others, that it is
connected with what precedes; as J says; (TA;)
the meaning being, I have destroyed the masters
of the elephant to make Kureysh remain at
Mekkeh, and for their uniting the journey of the
winter and of the summer, or spring; that when
they finished one, they should commence the
other; (T, S;) and this is like the saying,
ضَرَبْتُهُ لِكَذَا ضَرَبْتُهُ لِكَذَا لِكَذَا, with suppression of the [conjunctive] و: (S:) but Ibn-'Arafeh disapproves
of this, for two reasons: first, because the phrase
"In the name of God" &c. occurs between the
two chapters: [Bd, however, mentions that in
Ubeí's copy, the two compose one chapter:]
secondly, because ايلاف signifies the covenants,
or obligations, which they obtained when they
went forth on mercantile expeditions, and whereby
they became secure. (TA.) ↓ إِلَافٌ [in like manner]
signifies A writing of security, written by the
king for people, that they may be secure in his
territory: and is used by Musáwir Ibn-Hind in
the sense of اِيتِلَافٌ [as is also إِلْفٌ,] when he says,
in satirizing Benoo-Asad,
زَعَمْتُمْ أَنَّ إِخْوَتَكُمْ قُرَيْشٌ
لَهُمْ إِلْفٌ وَ لَيْسَ لَكُمْ إِلَافُ
meaning Ye asserted [that your brothers are
Kureysh; i. e.,] that ye are like Kureysh: but
how should ye be like them? for they have [an
alliance whereby they are protected in] the trade
of El-Yemen and Syria; and ye have not that
[alliance]. (Ham p. 636.) [Hence,] إِلَافُ اللّٰهِ
[a phrase used in the manner of an oath,] accord.
to some, signifies The safeguard, or protection, of
God: or, accord. to others, an honourable station
from God. (TA.)
-A2-  أَلَفَهُ, aor.
اَلِفَ, He gave him
a thousand; (S, K) of articles of property, and
of camels. (TA.)

الّف بَيْنَهُمْ, inf. n. تَأْلِيفٌ, (T, Msb, K,) He
united them, or brought them together, (T, Msb,
TA,) after separation; (T, TA;) and made them
to love one another; (Msb;) he caused union, or
companionship, (أُلْفَة,) to take place between them.
(K.) And أَلَّفْتُ بَيْنَ الشَّيْئَيْنِ, inf. n. as above, [I
united, or put together, the two things.] (S.) And
ألّف الشَّىْءَ He united, or connected, (T,) or gathered or collected or brought together, (M,) the
several parts of the thing. (T, M.) ―
-b2-  Hence,
تَأْلِيفُ الكُتُبِ [The composition of books]. (T, TA.)
―
-b3-  تَأْلِيفٌ is The putting many things into such a
state that one name becomes applicable to them,
whether there be to some of the parts a relation to
others by precedence and sequence, or not: so that
it is a more general term than تَرْتِيبٌ: (KT:) or
the collecting together, or putting together, suitable
things; from الالفة [i. e. الأُلْفَةُ]; and is a more
particular term than تَرْكِيبٌ, which is the putting
together things, whether suitable or not, or placed
in order or not. (Kull p. 118.)
-A2-  أَلَّفُوا إِلَى كَذَا:

hence,] he (a man) traded, or trafficked. (M,

-A3-  شَاَرَةٌ مُؤَالَفَةً He made a condition with

such a place. (T, S, * M, K. *) ―

-A3-
آلَفْتُ القَوْمَ, (T, * S, K, *) inf. n. as above, (S,) I

5
تألّف القَوْمُ, (Msb, K,) and ↓ ائْتَلَفُوا [written
with the disjunctive alif اِيْتَلَفُوا], (T, K,) The
people, or party, became united, or came together,
(Msb, K,) [after separation, (see 2, of which
each is said in the TA to be quasi-pass.,)] and
loved one another: (Msb:) or the meaning of
↓ ائْتِلَافٌ [and تَأَلُّفٌ also] is the being in a state of
union, alliance, agreement, congruity, or congregation: (Msb:) and the being familiar, sociable,
companionable, friendly, or amicable, one with
another. (TA.) And تَأَلَّفَا is said of two things;

of the words of IAar, كَانَ هَاشِمٌ يُؤْلِفُ إِلَى الشَّامِ,

is assigned to تألّفوا]; (M;) as also الى كذا ↓ أَلَّفُوا.

[Three thousand], not ثَلَاثَ آلَافٍ; (TA;) and
هٰذَا أَلْفٌ وَاحِدٌ [This is one thousand], not وَاحِدَةٌ;

from three to ten, inclusively, (TA,) and أُلُوفٌ,
(T, S, M, Msb, K,) used to denote more than ten;
(T;) and الأَافُ [in the TA الأَلَفُ] is used by
poetic licence for الآلَافُ, by suppression of the

إِلْفٌ [originally an inf. n. of أَلِفَهُ, q. v.,] He
with whom one is familiar, sociable, companionable, friendly, or amicable; he to whom one keeps
or cleaves; [a constant companion or associate;

to the large towns, or cities. (T, TA.) أُلُوفٌ in
the Kur ii. 244 is said by some to be pl. of إِلْفٌ

Those whose hearts are made to incline, or are
conciliated, by beneficence and love or affection:
(S, * Msb:) as used in the Kur [ix. 60], it is
applied to certain chief persons of the Arabs,
whom the Prophet was commanded to attract, or
allure, and to present with gifts, (T, K,) from the
poor-rates, (TA,) in order that they might make
those after them desirous of becoming Muslims,
(T, K,) and lest care for things which they deemed
sacred, or inviolable, together with the weakness
of their intentions, should induce them to combine
in hostility with the unbelievers against the Muslims; for which purpose, he gave them, on the
day of Honeyn, eighty [in the TA two hundred]
camels: (T:) they were certain men of eminence,
of the Arabs, to whom the Prophet used to give
gifts from the poor-rates; to some of them, to
prevent their acting injuriously; and to some,
from a desire of their becoming Muslims, (Mgh,
Msb,) and their followers also; (Msb;) and to

Muslims, because of their having recently become
such; but when Aboo-Bekr became appointed to
the government, he forbade this practice. (Mgh,
Msb.)
