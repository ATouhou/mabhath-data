ادى2
أدّاهُ, (T, S, M, &c.,) inf. n. تأٌدِيَةٌ (T, S, K)
and أَدَآءٌ, (T,) or the latter is a simple subst.,
(S, M, Msb, K,) [and so, accord. to the Msb,
is the former also, but this is a mistake,] He
made it, or caused it, to reach, arrive, or come
[to the appointed person or place &c.]; he brought,
conveyed, or delivered, it; syn. أَوْصَلَهُ; (M, Msb,
K;) namely, a thing; (M;) as, for instance,
الأَمَانَةَ إِلَى أهْلِهَا [the thing committed to his
trust and care, to its owner]: (Msb:) he delivered it, gave it up, or surrendered it: (T:)
he payed it, or discharged it; (S, K;) namely,
his debt, (S,) a bloodwit, a responsibility, and
the like; (Msb in art. غرم;) [and hence,] أَدَّى مَا
عَلَيْهِ [he acquitted himself of that which was
incumbent on him; or payed, or discharged,
what he owed]: (T:) he performed, fulfilled,
or accomplished, it; namely, [for instance,]
الحَجَّ [the pilgrimage]; (Msb in art. قضى;)
and in like manner, المَنَاسِكَ [the religious rites
and ceremonies of the pilgrimage]. (Jel in ii.
196, and Msb ubi suprà.) It is said in the Kur
[xliv. 17], أَنْ أَدُّوا إلَىَّ عِبَادَ اللّٰهِ, meaning Deliver
ye to me [the servants of God,] the children of
Israel: or, as some say, the meaning is, أَدُّوا إِلَىَّ
مَا أَمَرَكُمُ اللّٰهُ بِهِ يَا عِبَادَاللّٰهِ [perform ye to me
that which God hath commanded you to do, O
servants of God]: or it may mean listen ye,
or give ye ear, to me; as though the speaker said,
أَدُّوا إِلَىَّ سَمْعَكُمْ; the verb being used in this sense
by the Arabs. (T.) And one says, لَهُ ↓ تأَدَّيْتُ,
مِنْ حَقِّهِ, (K, TA,) and إلَيْهِ, in the place of لَهُ,
meaning أَدَّيْتُهُ; (TA;) i. e. I payed him his
due, or right. (K, TA.) And a man says,
↓ مَا أَدْرِى كَيْفَ أَتَأَدَّى [I know not how to pay].
(TA.) One says also, أدّى عَنْهُ [meaning He
payed, or made satisfaction, for him]: and أدّى
عَنْهُ الخَرَاجَ [He payed for him, or in his stead,
the land-tax]. (Mgh in art. جزأ.) [Hence,]
El-Akhnas says,
فَأَدَّيْتُ عَنِّى مَا اسْتَعَرتُ مِنَ الصِّبَا
وَ لِلْمَالِ عِنْدِىِ اليَوْمَ رَاعٍ وَ كَاسِبُ
i. e. But I have put away from me [what I had
borrowed, or assumed, of the folishness of youth,
and amorous dalliance,] and now I am [or
there is at my abode] a keeper and collector to
the camels, or cattle, or property. (Ham p. 346.)

استأداهُ مَالًا He desired, or sought, to obtain
from him property, or sued, or prosecuted, him

أَدَآءٌ a subst. from 2 [signifying The act of
making, or causing, to reach, arrive, or come
to the appointed person or place &c.; of bringing,
conveying, or delivering; of giving up, or surrendering; payment, or discharge, of a debt &c.;
the act of acquitting oneself of that which is
incumbent on him; performance, fulfilment, or
accomplishment]. (S, M, Msb, K.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,]
هُوَ حَسَنُ الأَدَآءِ He has a good manner of pronouncing, or uttering, the letters. (TA.) ―
-b3-  أَدَآءٌ
as a term of the law signifies The performance
of an act of religious service [such as prayer &c.]
at the appointed time: opposed to قَضَآءٌ, performance at a time other than that which is
appointed. (Msb and TA in art. قضى.)
أَدِىٌّ : see art. ادو.
آدَى [a noun denoting the comparative and
superlative degrees, irregularly formed from the
verb أَدّى; like as the noun آدَى mentioned in
art. ادو is irregularly formed from the verb آدَى].
You say, هُوَ آدَى لِلأَمَانةِ [He is more, or better,
disposed to deliver, give up, or surrender, the
thing committed to his trust and care] (T, S,
M, K) مِنْكَ [than thou], (S,) or مِنْ غَيْرِهِ [than
another than he]. (M, * K.) [Az says,] the
vulgar say, أَدَّى لِلْأَمَانَةِ; but this is incorrect,
and not allowable; and I have not known any
one of the grammarians allow آدَى, because أَفْعَل
denoting wonder [and the comparative and superlative degrees] is not formed but from the triliteral [verb], and one does not say, أَدَى in the
sense of أَدَّى: the proper phrase is أَحْسَنُ أَدَآءً.
