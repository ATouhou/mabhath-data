ازى2
أزّى الحَوْضَ, inf. n. تَأْزِيَةٌ (S, K) and تَأْزِىْءٌ,
or تَوْزِىْءٌ, (accord. to different copies of the S,
[the latter irregular,]) or both, (accord. to the
TA,) He put, or made, an إِزَآء [q. v.], to the
watering-trough or tank; (S, K;) i. e. he put
upon its mouth a stone, or a جُلَّة [explained
below, voce إِزَآء], or the like; (TA;) as also
↓ آزاهُ, inf. n. إِيزَآءٌ; (S, TA;) or ↓ تأزّاهُ. (K.)

آزاهُ, (S, K,) inf. n. مُؤَازَاةٌ, (Msb in art. حذو,
and TA in art. وزى, &c., [though it would seem
from the K to be إِيزَآءٌ,]) He (a man, S) was,
or became, over against it, or opposite to it;
he faced, or fronted, him, or it. (S, * K, * TA
in art. وزى.) Accord. to the S, one should not
say, وَازَاهُ: but it is said in a trad. respecting the
prayer of fear, فَوَازَيْنَا العَدُوَّ, i. e. And we faced,
or fronted, the enemy: (TA:) and the inf. n.
is مُوَازَاةٌ. (TA in art. وزى.) [Its syn. حَاذَاهُ
is more common.]
-A2-  [Hence مُؤَازَأْق signifying
A conformity, a mutual resemblance, or a correspondence, with regard to sound, of two words
occurring near together; like اِزْدِوَاجٌ &c.: see
art. زوج.]
-A3-  [Hence, likewise,] آزِاهُ also signifies
He contended with him, syn. جَارَاهُ; (K, TA;)
and opposed, or withstood, him, syn. قَاوَمَهُ. (TA.)
Whence the saying in a trad., وَفِرْقَةٌ آزَتِ الْمُلُوكَ
فَقَاتَلَتْهُمْ عَلَى دِينِ اللّٰهِ [And a party contended
with, and opposed, or withstood, the kings, and
fought with them for the religion of God].
(TA.)

state, the إِزَآء [q. v.] of the watering-trough or
tank. (IAar, TA.) ―

تَاَزَّىَ see 2.
نَاقَةٌ أَزِيَةٌ, (accord. to some copies of the S,)
or ↓ آزِيَةٌ, (accord. to other copies of the S,) or
both, (IAar, TA,) each after the manner of a
relative noun, [having no verb,] (TA,) A she-camel that drinks from the إِزَآء [q. v.]: (TA:) or
that will not drink save from the إِزَآء of the trough
or tank; and عَقِرَةٌ signifies one “that will not
drink save from the عُقْر [thereof]:” (S, TA, and
IAar in art. عقر in the TA:) or, accord. to IAar,
that will not come to the watering-trough or tank,
to drink, until they leave it unoccupied for her;
as also قَذُورٌ. (TA in the present art.)
الإِزَآءُ i. q. الحِذَآءُ [The front, as meaning the
part, place, or location, that is over against,
opposite, facing, fronting, or in front]. (Msb,
and K &c. in art. حذو.) You say, هُوَبِإِزَائِهِ He
is over against, opposite to, facing, fronting, or
in front of, him; syn. بِحِذَائِهِ, (S,) or مُحَاذِيهِ.
(Msb.) ―
-b2-  [Hence, بِإِزَآئِهِ signifies also Corresponding to it; as when one says,] الأَبْجَلُ عِرْقٌ مِنَ
الفَرَسِ وَ البَعِيرِ بِإِزَآءِ الأَكْحَلِ مِنَ الإِنْسَانِ [The ابجل
is a vein of the horse and the camel, corresponding
to the اكحل of man]. (TA in art. بجل.) [You
say also, وَضَعَ لَفْظًا بِإِزَآءِ مَعْنَّى He applied a word,
or phrase, as correspondent to an idea, or a meaning.]
-A2-  إِزَآءٌ is also applied to a man, and to a
woman, and to a number of persons, in senses
here following. (TA.) You say, هُوَ إِزَآءُ الأَمْرِ He
is the manager, conductor, orderer, regulator, or
superintendent, of the affair. (S, Msb, TA.) And
in the same sense the word is used by Homeyd,
in the phrase إِزَآءُ مَعَاشٍ [The manager, or orderer,
of the means of subsistence], applied to a woman.
(TA.) And in an instance in which a poet likens
the إِزَآء of a watering-trough or tank to the [stinking animal called] ظَرِبَان: (S, TA:) in this case
it means The water-drawer [of the trough or
tank]. (As, IB, TA.) [But in relation to a
watering-trough or tank, it generally has another
meaning, which see below.] You say also, فُلَانٌ
إِزَآءٌ مَالٍ (S) [Such a one is] a manager, tender,
or superintendent, of cattle, or camels &c.; (K, *
TA;) a good pastor thereof. (TA.) And إِزَآءُ
الحَرْبِ The vigorous wager, or prosecutor, of war.
(K.) And فُلَانٌ إِزَآءُ فُلَانٍ Such a one is the fellow
and assistant of such a one. (TA.) And هُمْ إِزَاؤُهُمْ
They are their fellows, (K, TA,) who assist
them, and order, or set in order, their affairs:
(TA:) or they are those who order, or set in
order, their affairs. (Msb.) And إِنَّهُ لَإِ زَآءُ خَيْرٍ,
and شَّرٍ, Verily he is a possessor of goodness,
and of evilness. (TA.) ―

or إِزَآءُ العيش, (TK,) The means of sustenance: or what has been caused, or occasioned,
of plentifulness and easiness, and of superabundance, of sustenance. (K.)
-A3-  Also The place
where the water is poured into the wateringtrough or tank; (As, S, K;) i. e. its fore part;
[the part next to the well or other source whence
it is filled;] the hinder part, where the camels
stand when they come to water, being called the
عُقْر: (S in art. عقر:) or, accord. to AZ, a mass
of stone, and what is put for protection [of the
brink of the trough or tank (as it is generally
constructed of stones cemented and plastered with
mud)] upon the place where the water is poured
when the bucket is emptied: (S in the present
art.:) or the whole (جَمِيع [said in the TA to be
a mistake for جمع, but this I think extremely
improbable,]) of what is between the wateringtrough or tank and the cavity of the well,
[namely,] of the [casing of stones, or bricks,
called] طَّى: (K:) or a stone, or skin, or جُلَّة
[i. e. a thing made of palm-leaves woven together,
generally used as a receptacle for dates], put [for
protection] upon the mouth [or part of the border
where the water is poured in] of the wateringtrough or tank: (K, * TA:) in the K, يُوضَعُ عَلَيْهَا
الحَوْضُ is erroneously put for يوضع عَلَى فَمِ
الحَوْضِ. (TA.)
