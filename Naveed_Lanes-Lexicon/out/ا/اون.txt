اون1
آنَ, aor. يَؤُونُ, inf. n. أَوْنٌ, He was, or
became, at rest, or at ease; he rested in a journey.
(IAar, T.) ―
-b2-  أُنْتُ, aor. and inf. n. as above, I
enjoyed a life of ease and plenty; a state of
freedom from trouble or inconvenience, and toil
or fatigue; a state of ease, repose, or tranquillity. (AZ, T, S, M, K.) ―
-b3-  I was, or became,
grave, staid, steady, sedate, or calm. (S, K.) ―
-b4-
I was, or became, gentle; or I acted gently:
(T, S, M, Msb, K:) and I acted, or proceeded,
with moderation, without haste or hurry, in pace
or journeying: (M:) I went gently, softly, or
in a leisurely manner: (S, K:) أَوْنٌ [the inf. n.]
is formed by substitution [of أ for ه] from هَوْنٌ.
(S.) You say, أُنْتُ بِالشَّىْءِ, and عَلَى الشَّىْءِ, I
was gentle, or I acted gently, with the thing;
(M;) and فِى الأَمْرِ in the affair. (Msb.) And
أُنْ عَلَى نَفْسِكَ Act thou gently with thyself, or
be thou gentle, in pace or journeying: and proceed
thou with moderation, without haste or hurry:
(T, S:) said in the latter sense to one who has
become unsteady, or irresolute. (T.) [In like
manner,] you say, عَلَى قَدْرِكَ ↓ أَوِّنْ, meaning
اِتَّئِدْ عَلَى نَحْوِكَ [app. Act thou with moderation,
gentleness, deliberation, or in a leisurely manner,
according to thine ability, or to the measure of
thine ability; for قَدْرٌ and نَحْوٌ are both syn.
with مِقْدَارٌ]. (T, K.) And فِى سَيْرِكُمْ ↓ أَوِّنُوا
Proceed ye with moderation in your course or
pace or journeying. (ISk, T.) And فِى ↓ تَأَوَّنَ
الأَمْرِ He paused, or was patient, in the affair.
(M.)
-A2-  أَوْنٌ also signifies The being weary, or
fatigued; like أَيْنٌ. (M.) [Whether, in this
sense, it have a verb, is doubtful: see its syn.
here mentioned.] ―
-b2-  Also The putting oneself to
trouble, or inconvenience, for the sake of what one
may expend upon himself and his family. (M.)
And hence, accord. to one [whose name is imperfectly written in the TA], the word ↓ مَؤُونَةٌ,
[as being originally مَأْوُنَةٌ,] of the measure مَفْعُلَةٌ:
but others say that it is of the measure فَعُولَةٌ,
from مَأَنْتُ. (TA.)
-A3-  ↓ آنَ أَوْنُكَ and أَوَانُكَ [and
أَيْنُكَ] signify the same. (M.) [See art. اين.]
2
اَوَّنَ see 1, in two places.
5
تَاَوَّنَ see 1.
الآنَ and its vars.: see art. اين. [Accord. to
some, it belongs to the present art., in which it
is mentioned in the Msb.]
أَوْنٌ: see 1 [of which it is the inf. n.]: and
see also what next follows.
أَوَانٌ (T, S, M, Msb, K) and ↓ إِوَانٌ, (T, M,
Msb, K,) the latter mentioned by Ks on the
authority of Aboo-Jámi', but the former is the
usual mode of pronouncing it, (T,) and ↓ أَوْنٌ,
(M,) A time; a season: pl. آوِنَةٌ; (T, S, M,
Msb, K;) but Sb says آوناتٌ; (M; [so in a
copy of that work; app. آوِنَاتٌ, as though pl.
of آوِنَةٌ;]) and آيِنَةٌ is syn. with آوِنَةٌ. (AA, T,
K.) You say, جَآءَ أَوَانُ البَرْدِ [The time, or season,
of cold came]. (T.) And فُلَانٌ يَصْنَعُ ذٰلِكَ الأَمْرَ
آوِنَةً, (S, K, *) and آيِنَةً, (K, [in the CK آئِنَةً,])
Such a one does that thing sometimes, leaving
it undone sometimes. (S, K. *) And أَتَيْتُهُ آينَةً
بَعْدَ آيِنَةٍ I came to him times after times. (AA,
T.) And آوِنَةً signifies Time after time. (TA,
from a trad.) In the saying (of Aboo-Zubeyd, L),
طَلَبُوا صُلْحَنَا وَلَاتَ أَوَانٍ
(M,) or إِوَانٍ, (L,) [They sought our reconciliation with them, but it was not the time that
reconciliation should be sought], accord. to Abu-l-
'Abbás, the tenween of the last word is not a sign
of the genitive case, but is, as in the instance
of إِذٍ, because of the suppression of a proposition
to which the word should be prefixed, as when
you say, جِئْتُ أَوَانَ قَامَ زَيْدٌ I came at the time
that Zeyd stood. (M, L.) ―
-b2-  [Hence, أَوَانَئِذٍ At
that time or season; then; like حِينَئِذٍ.]
إِوَانٌ: see أَوَانٌ:
-A2-  and see also إِيَوَانٌ.
آئِنٌ [part. n. of 1:] A man enjoying a life of
ease and plenty; a state of freedom from trouble
or inconvenience, and toil or fatigue; a state
of ease, repose, or tranquillity. (AZ, T, S, K.)
―
-b2-  [Hence the saying,] رِبْعٌ آئِن خَيْرٌ مِنْ غِبٍّ
حَصْحَاصٍ [An easy, or a gentle, journey in which
the camels are watered only on the first and
fourth days is better than a laborious, or quick,
journey in which they are watered only on the
first and third days]. (TA.) [The fem. is آئِنَةٌ:
the pl. of which is أَوَائِنُ and آئِنَاتٌ.] You say,
بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَ مَكًّةَ ثَلَاثُ لَيَالٍ أَوَائِنُ Between us and
Mekkeh are three nights of easy, or gentle, journeying: (S, K: *) and عَشْرُلَيَال آئِنَاتٌ ten nights
of easy journeying. (S, M, K.)
إِيوَانٌ and ↓ إِوَانٌ (T, S, M, Msb, K) [each] a
foreign word, [i. e. Persian,] (M,) A chamber,
or an apartment, (T, Msb,) or a large صُفَّة [i. e.
porch, or roofed vestibule, or the like], (S, K,)
similar to an أَزَج [or oblong arched or vaulted
structure, or a portico], (T, S, M, K,) or built in
the form of an أَزَج, (Msb,) not closed in the
front, or face: (T, M, Msb: *) [and a palace;
often used in this sense in Arabic as well as in
Persian: and in the present day, the former, and
more commonly لِيوَان, which is Persian, is also
applied to an estrade; a slightly-raised portion
of the floor, generally extending nearly from the
door to the end, or to each end, of a room:] pl.
of the former, أَوَاوِينُ, (T, S, K,) because the sing.
is originally إِوْوَانٌ, (S,) and إِيوَانَاتٌ; and pl. of
the latter, أُونٌ. (T, S, K.) Hence, إِيوَانُ كِسْرَى
[The great porch, or the palace, of Kisrà, or
Chosroes, who is called صَاحِبُ الإِيوَانِ]. (T, S,
Msb.) ―
-b2-  Also the latter, [and app., accord. to
the Msb, the former also,] Any prop, or support,
of a thing: (T, Msb:) particularly, a pole of a
[tent of the kind called] خِبَآء. (T.) ―
-b3-  The إِيوَان
of the لِجَام [is The headstall of the bridle; and]
has for its pl. إِيوَانَاتٌ. (T, K.)
مَؤُونَةٌ: see 1, and see art. مأن.
