اَنڤثَ [أَنُثَ, aor.
اَنُثَ, inf. n. أَنَاثَةٌ and أُنُوثَةٌ, (see the
former of these two ns. below,) It was, or became,
female, feminine, or of the feminine gender. ―
-b2-
And hence, أَنُثَتْ, said of land (أَرْض), (tropical:)  It was,
or became, such as is termed أَنِيثَة. ―
-b3-  Hence also,]
أَنُثَ, said of iron, (tropical:)  It was, or became, soft.
(Golius, from the larger of two editions of the
lexicon entitled مرقاة اللغة.) Accord. to IAar,
softness is the primary signification. (M.) [But
accord. to the A, the second and third of the
meanings given above are tropical: (see أَنِيثٌ:)
and the verb in the first of the senses here assigned
to it, if not proper, is certainly what is termed
حَقِيقَة عُرْفِيَّة, i. e., conventionally regarded as
proper.]

أنّثهُ, inf. n. تَأْنِيثٌ, He made it (namely, a

Msb;) he attached to it, or to that which was syntactically dependent upon it, the sign of the feminine gender. (Msb.) ―

effeminate. (KL.) [See the pass. part. n., below.]
-A2-  أنّث لَهُ, inf. n. as above, (tropical:)  He acted gently, [or
effeminately] towards him; as also له ↓ تأنّث.
(K, TA.) And أنّث فِى أَمْرِهِ, inf. n. as above, (T,
A,) (tropical:)  He acted gently in his affair: (A:) or he
applied himself gently to his affair: (T:) and
some say, فى امره ↓ تأنّث, meaning he acted
effeminately in his affair. (T, TA.)

أُنْثَي Female; feminine; of the female, or
feminine, sex, or gender; contr. ?? ذَكَرٌ: (T, S,
M:) an epithet applied to anything of that sex or
gender: (T:) IAar asserts, that a woman is termed
انثي from the phrase بَلَدٌ أَنِيثٌ, q. v, because of
her softness; she being more soft than a man:
(M, L:) [but see the observation at the end of
the first paragraph of this art.:] the pl. is إِنَاثٌ;
(T, S, M, A, Msb, K;) and sometimes one says
أُنُثٌ, as though it were pl. of إِنَاثٌ; (S;) or it is
[truly] pl. of إِنَاثٌ, like as نُمُرٌ is of نِمَارٌ; (T;)
and أَنَاثَى, (T, A, Msb, K,) which last occurs in
poetry. (T.) You say, هٰذَا طَائِرٌ وَ أُنْثَاهُ [This is a
(male) bird and his female]: not أُنْثَاتُهُ. (ISk, T.)
In the Kur iv. 117, I'Ab reads أُثُنًا [in the place
of أُنُثًا or إِنَاثًا]; and Fr says that it is pl. of
وَثَنٌ, the و in وُثُنٌ being changed into أ as in
أُقِّتَتٌ [for وُقِّتَتٌ]. (T, L.) ―
-b2-  اِمْرَأَةٌ أَنْثَى (tropical:)  [A feminine woman,] means a perfect woman; (T, A, K;)
a woman being thus termed in praise; like as a
man is termed رَجُلٌ ذَكَرٌ. (T, A.) ―
-b3-  [The pl.]
إِنَاثٌ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  Inanimate things; (Lh, T,
M, K;) as trees and stones (T, K) and wood.
(T.) In the passage of the Kur mentioned above,
إِنَاثًا is said to have this meaning: (T, M:) [or it
there means females; for] Fr says that El-Lát and
El-'Ozzà and the like were said by the Arabs to
be feminine divinities. (T, TA.) ―
-b2-  Also (assumed tropical:)  Small
stars. (K.) ―
-b3-  And [the dual] الأُنْثَيَانِ (tropical:)  The two

the former is generally, though app. not always,
meant by الانثيان]. (M, Mgh, Msb.) ―

-b6-
And أُنْثَيَا الفَرَسِ (assumed tropical:)  The inner parts (الرَّبَلَتَانِ) of
the thighs of the horse. (M, L.) ―

مَنْجَنِيق; because the latter word is [generally] of
the feminine gender. (M.)
