افخ1
أَفَخَهُ, (A'Obeyd, S, L, &c.,) aor.
اَفِخَ, inf. n.
أَفْخٌ, (L,) He, [or it] struck him, or hit him, [or
hurt him,] on the part of his head called the
يَأْفُوخ. (A'Obeyd, S, L, Msb, K.) He who pronounces يافوخ without ء says يَفَخَهُ. (Msb.)
مَأْفُوخٌ A man having his head broken in the
part called the يَأْفُوخ. (L.)
يَأْفُوخٌ, (Lth, Az, S, Msb, K,) as also يَافُوخٌ,
without ء, but the former is the more correct and
the better, (Lth, Az, Msb,) and is of the measure
يَفْعُولٌ, (Lth, Az, S, Msb,) whereas the latter is
of the measure فَاعُولٌ, (Lth, Az, Msb,) [The top,
vertex, or crown, of the head; or the part of the
top of the head which is crossed by the coronal
suture, and comprises a portion of the sagittal
suture;] the part where the anterior and posterior bones of the head meet; (K;) the place
that is in a state of commotion in the head of
an infant; (S;) the place which, in the head
of a child, does not close up until after some
years; or does not become knit together in its
several parts; and this is where the bone of the
anterior part of the head and that of its posterior
part meet; (Zj in his “ Khalk el-Insán; ”) the
place that is soft, in a child's head, before the two
bones called the نَمَّاغَة and رَمَّاعَة meet, between the
هَامَة [or middle of the head] and the forehead:
(L:) or the middle of the head when it has
become hard and strong; before which it is not
thus called: (Msb:) pl. يَآفِيخُ; (S;) so in the
old lexicons [in general]; but in the T and K
يَوَافِيخُ [which is pl. of يافوخ without ء; or, as pl.
of يأفوخ, is like تَوَارِيخُ as pl. of تَأْرِيخٌ]; and
because of this form of the pl., F says that J is
in error in mentioning the word in the present
art.: it has been shown, however, that J is not in
error in this case. (TA.) — [Hence the saying,]
أَنْتُمْ يَآفِيخُ الشَّرَفِ (tropical:)  Ye are the centres and summits
of the heads of nobility. (L, from a trad.) And
يَأْفُوخُ اللَّيْلِ (assumed tropical:)  The main [or middle] part of the
night. (S, K.) — [See also art. يفخ.]
