أَلَا, (S, M, Mgh, K,) aor. يَأْلُو, (S, Mgh,)
inf. n. أَلْوٌ (T, M, Mgh, K) and أُلُوُّ (K, TA [in
a copy of the M أَلُوٌّ]) and أُلِىٌّ; (K, TA; [in
a copy of the M أَلِىٌّ, and in a copy of the Mgh
written with fet-h and damm to the أ;]) and
↓ أَلَّى, (S, M, K,) aor. يُؤَلّى, inf. n. تَأْلِيَةٌ; (S;)
and ↓ ائتلى [written with the disjunctive alif
اِيتَلَى]; (S, M, K;) [and ↓ تَأَلّى, as appears from
an ex. in a verse cited in art. نشب, q. v.;] He
fell short; or he fell short of doing what was
requisite, or what he ought to have done; or he
flagged, or was remiss; syn. قَصَّرَ: (S, M, K;
and Fr, IAar, T, Mgh, in explanation of the first
of these verbs:) and he was slow, or tardy:
(M, K; and AA, T, S, in explanation of the
second verb:) or he flagged, or was remiss, or
languid, and weak. (A Heyth and T in explanation of all of the above-mentioned verbs except the
last.) You say, أَلَا فِى الأَمْرِ, (Mgh,) and ↓ ائتلى
فِيهِ, (S,) He fell short, &c., (قَصَّرَ,) in the affair.
(S, Mgh.) In the saying, لَم يَأْلُ أَنْ يَعْدِلَ فِى ذلِكَ,
i. e. He did not fall short, &c., (لَمْ يُقَصَّرْ,) in
acting equitably and equally in that, فِى is
suppressed before ان: but in the phrase, لَمْ يَأْلُو
مِنَ العَدْلِ, as some relate it, [the meaning intended
seems to be, They did not hold back, or the like,
from acting equitably; for here] the verb is
made to imply the meaning of another verb: and
such is the case in the saying, لَا آلُوكَ نُصْحًا,
meaning I will not refuse to thee, nor partially
or wholly deprive thee of, sincere, honest, or
faithful, advice: (Mgh:) or this last signifies
I will not flag, or be remiss, nor fall short,
to thee in giving sincere, honest, or faithful,
advice. (T, S. *) It is said in the Kur [iii. 114],
لَا يَإْلُونَكُمْ خَبَالًا, meaning They will not fall short,
or flag, or be remiss, in corrupting you. (IAar,
T.) And the same meaning is assigned to the
verb in the saying أُولُو الْفَضْلِ مِنْكُمْ, ↓ وَلَا يَأْتَلِ, in
the Kur [xxiv. 22], by A'Obeyd: but the preferable rendering in this case is that of A Heyth,
which will be found below: see 4. (T.) Ks
mentions the phrase, أَقْبَلَ بِضَرْبَةٍ لَا يَأْلُ [He came
with a blow, not falling short, &c.], for لا يَأْلُو;
like لَا أَدْرِ [for لا أَدْرِى]. (S, M: [but in the
copies of the former in my hands, for بِضَرْبَةٍ, I
find يَضْرِبُهُ.]) ↓ أَلَّى [with teshdeed] is also said
of a dog, and of a hawk, meaning He fell short
of attaining the game that he pursued. (TA.)
And of a cake of bread, meaning It was slow
in becoming thoroughly baked. (IAar, IB.) [See
also the phrase لَا دَريْتَ وَلَا ائْتَليْتَ in a later
part of this paragraph.] ―
-b2-  You say also, مَا أَلَوْتُ
الشَّيْءَ, (K,) or مَا أَلَوْتُ أَنْ أَفْعَلَهُ, (M,) inf. n أَلوٌ
(M, K) and أُلُوٌّ, (K, TA, [in a copy of the M
أُلْوٌ,]) meaning I did not leave, quit, cease from,
omit, or neglect, (M, K,) the thing, (K,) or doing
it. (M.) And فُلَانٌ لَا يَأْلُو خَيْرًا Such a one does
not leave, quit, or cease from, doing good. (M.)
And مَا أَلَوْتُ جَهْدًا I did not leave, omit, or
neglect, labour, exertion, effort, or endeavour:
and the vulgar say, مَا آلُوكَ جَهْدًا; but this is
wrong: so says As. (T. [See, however, similar
phrases mentioned above.])
-A2-  أَلَا, aor. as above,
(TA,) inf. n. أَلْوٌ, (IAar, T, TA,) also signifies
He strove, or laboured; he exerted himself, or
his power or ability; (IAar, T, TA;) as also
↓ تَأَلَّى: (T, TA:) the contr. of a signification
before mentioned; i. e. “he flagged;,” or “was
remiss, or languid, and weak.” (TA.) You
say, أَتَانِى فِى حَاجَةٍ فَأَلَوْتُ فِيهَا He came to me
respecting a want, and I strove, or laboured, &c.,
to accomplish it. (T.) ―
-b2-  And أَلَاهُ, aor. as above,
(T, S,) inf. n. أَلْوٌ, (IAar, T, S,) He was, or
became, able to do it: (IAar, T, S:) and ↓ ألّى,
inf. n. تَأْلِيَةٌ, also signifies he was, or became,
able; (TA;) and so ↓ ائتلى. (ISk, S, TA.)
You say, هُوَ يَأْلُو هذَا الأَمْرَ He is able to perform,
or accomplish, this affair. (T.) And مَا أَلَوْتُهُ I
was not able to do it. (T, M, K.) And أَتَانِى
فُلَانٌ فِى حَاجَةٍ فَمَا أَلَوْتُ رَدَّهُ Such a one came
to me respecting a want, and I was not able to
rebuff him. (T.) It is said in a trad., مَنْ صَامَ
↓ الدَّهْرَ فَلَا صَامَ وَلَا أَلَّى [He who fasts ever, or
always, may he neither fast] nor be able to fast:
as though it were an imprecation: or it may
be enunciative: another reading is وَلَا آلَ, explained as meaning وَلَا رَجَعَ: [See art. اول:]
but El-Khattábee says that it is correctly أَلَّى
and أَلَا. (TA.) And the Arabs used to say,
(S, M,) [and] accord. to a trad. it will be said to
the hypocrite [in his grave], on his being asked
respecting Mohammad and what he brought,
and answering “I know not,” (T in art. تلو,)
↓ لَا دَرَيْتَ وَلَا ائتَلَيْتَ, (T, S, M, K,) meaning,
accord. to As, (T,) or ISk, (S,) Mayest thou
not know, nor be able to know: (T, S: *) or,
accord. to Fr, nor fall short, or flag, in seeking
to know; that the case may be the more miserable
to thee: (T:) or وَلَا أَلَيْتَ, as an imitative sequent
[for ولا أَلَوْتَ, to which the same explanations
are applicable]: (MK:) or لَا دَرَيْتَ وَلَا تَلَيْتَ,
the latter verb being assimilated to the former,
(ISk, T in art. تلو, S,) said to mean وَلَا تَلَوْتَ,
i. e. nor mayest thou read nor study: (T in art.
تلو:) or لَا دَرَيْتَ وَلَا أَتْليْتَ, i. e. [mayest thou
not know,] nor mayest thou have camels followed
by young ones. (Yoo, ISk, T, S, M, K.) ―
-b2-  Also,
(IAar, T,) inf. n. أَلْوٌ, (IAar, T, K,) He gave him
a thing: (IAar, T, K: *) [doubly trans.:] the
contr. of a signification before mentioned, (also
given by IAar, T and TA,) which is that of
“refusing” [a person anything: see, above,
لَا آلُوكَ نُصْحًا]. (TA.)

آلى, (T, S, M, &c.,) aor. يُؤْلِى, inf. n. إِيلَآءٌ,
(T, S, Mgh,) [and in poetry إِلَآءٌ, (see a reading
of a verse cited voce أَلِيّةٌ,)] He swore; (T, S, M,
Mgh, K;) as also ↓ تألّى, and ↓ ائتلى. (T, S, M,
K.) You say, آلَيْتُ عَلَى الشَّىْءِ and آلَيْتُهُ [I swore
to do the thing]. (M.) [And آلَيْتُ لَا أَفْعَلُ كَذَا
I swore that I would not do such a thing; and,
emphatically, I swear that I will not do such
a thing. And آلَى يَمِينًا He swore an oath.] It
is said in the Kur [xxiv. 22], أُولُو ↓ وَلَا يَأْتَلِ
الْفَضْلِ مِنْكُمْ, meaning, accord. to A Heyth and
Fr, And let not those of you who possess superabundance swear [that they will not give to
relations &c.]; for Aboo-Bekr [is particularly
alluded to thereby, because he] had sworn that he
would not expend upon Mistah and his relations
who had made mention of [the scandal respecting]
'Áïsheh: and some of the people of El-Medeeneh
read ↓ وَلَا يَتَأَلَّ, but this disagrees with the written
text: A'Obeyd explains it differently: see 1:
but the preferable meaning is that here given.
(T.) And it is said in a trad., آلَي مِنْ نِسَائِهِ شَهْرًا
He swore that he would not go in to his wives
for a month: the verb being here made trans.
by means of من because it implies the meaning
of اِمْتِنَاع, which is thus trans. (TA.) [See also
an ex. of the verb thus used in the Kur ii. 226.]
عَلَى اللّٰهِ ↓ التَّأَلِّى is said to mean One's saying,
By God, such a one will assuredly enter the fire
[of Hell], and God will assuredly make to have
a good issue the work of such a one: but see
the act. part. n. below. (TA.)
-A2-  آلَتْ, inf. n.

made, or prepared, a مِئْلَاة, q. v. (TA.)

أَلْوٌ, or إِلْوٌ: see إِلًى in art. الى.
أُلُو, (so in some copies of the S, and so in
the K in the last division of that work, and in
the CK in art. ال, [and thus it is always pronounced,] but in some copies of the K in art. ال
it is written أُلُونَ, [as though to show the original
form of its termination,]) or أُولُو, (so in the M,
and in some copies of the S, [and thus it is
generally written,]) i. q. ذَوُو [Possessors of;
possessed of; possessing; having]; a pl. which
has no sing. (S, M, K) of its own proper letters,
(S, K,) its sing. being ذُو: (S:) or, as some
say, a quasi-pl. n., of which the sing. is ذُو: (K:)
the fem. is أُلَاتُ, (so in some copies of the S and
K, [and thus it is always pronounced,]) or
أُولَاتُ, (so in other copies of the S and K, [and
thus it is generally written,]) of which the sing.
is ذَاتُ: (S, K:) it is as though its sing. were
أُلٌ, (M, K, [in the CK الٌ,]) the [final] و [in
the masc.] being the sign of the pl., (M,) for
it has و [for its termination] in the nom. case,
and ى in the accus. and gen. (M, K.) It is
never used but as a prefixed noun. (M, K.)
The following are exs. of the nom. case: نَحْنُ أُولُو
قُوَّةٍ وَأُولُو بَأْسٍ شَدِيدٍ [We are possessors of strength,
and possessors of vehement courage], in the Kur
[xxvii. 23]; and أُولُو الْأَرْحَامِ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلَى بِبَعْضٍ
[The possessors of relationships, these have the
best title to inheritance, one with respect to
another], in the same [viii. last verse and xxxiii.
6]; (TA;) and جَآءَ نِى أُولُو الأَلْبَابِ [The persons
of understandings came to me]; and أُولَاتُ الأَحْمَالِ
[Those who are with child; occurring in the
Kur lxv. 4]: (S:) and the following are exs.
of the accus. and gen. cases: وَذَرْنِى وَالْمُكَذَّبِينَ
أُولِى النَّعْمَةِ [And leave thou me, or let me alone,
with the beliers, or discrediters, (i. e., commit
their case to me,) the possessors of ease and plenty],
in the Kur [lxxiii. 11]; and لَتَنُوءُ بِالْعُصْبَةِ أُولِى
القُوَّةِ [Would weigh down the company of men
possessing strength], in the same [xxviii. 76].
(TA.) وَأُولِى الْأَمْرِ مِنْكُمْ, in the Kur [iv. 62],
[And those, of you, who are possessors of command], (M, K, *) accord. to Aboo-Is-hák, (M,)
means the companions of the Prophet, and the
men of knowledge their followers, (M, K,) and
the possessors of command, who are their followers,
when also possessors of knowledge and religion:
(K:) or, as some say, [simply] the possessors
of command; for when these are possessors of
knowledge and religion, and take, or adopt and
maintain, and follow, what the men of knowledge
say, to obey them is of divine obligation: and
in general those who are termed أُولُو الأَمْرِ, of the
Muslims, are those who superintend the affairs of
such with respect to religion, and everything conducing to the right disposal of their affairs. (M.)
إِلَى, accord. to Sb, is originally with و in the
place of the [ى, i. e. the final] alif; and so is عَلَى; for
the alifs [in these two particles] are not susceptible
of imáleh; [i. e., they may not be pronounced
ilè and 'alè;] and if either be used as the proper
name of a man, the dual [of the former] is إِلَوَانِ
and [that of the latter] عَلَوَانِ; but when a pronoun is affixed to it, the alif is changed into yé,
so that you say إِلَيْكَ and عَلَيْكَ; though some of
the Arabs leave it as it was, saying إِلَاكَ and عَلَاكَ.
(S.) It is a prep., or particle governing a noun
in the gen. case, (S, Mughnee, K,) and denotes
the end, as opposed to [مِنْ, which denotes] the
beginning, of an extent, or of the space between
two points or limits; (S, M;) or the end of an
extent (T, Mughnee, K) of place; [signifying To,
or as far as;] as in the phrase [in the Kur xvii. 1],
مِنَ المَسْجِدِ الحَرَامِ إِلَى المَسْجِدِ الأَقْصَى [From
the Sacred Mosque to, or as far as, the Furthest
Mosque; meaning from the mosque of Mekkeh
to that of Jerusalem]; (Mughnee, K;) or in the
saying, خَرَجْتُ مِنَ الكُوفَةِ إِلَى مَكَّةَ [I went forth
from El-Koofeh to Mekkeh], which may mean
that you entered it, [namely, the latter place,] or
that you reached it without entering it, for the
end includes the beginning of the limit and the
furthest part thereof, but does not extend beyond
it. (S.) [In some respects it agrees with حَتَّى,
q. v. And sometimes it signifies Towards; as in
نَظَرَ إِلَىَّ He looked towards me; and مَالَ إِلَيْهِ
He, or it, inclined towards him, or it. ―
-b2-  It also
denotes the end of a space of time; [signifying To,
till, or until;] as in the saying [in the Kur ii. 183],
ثُمَّ أَتِمُّوا الصِّيَامَ إِلَى اللَّيْلِ [Then complets ye the
fasting to, or till, or until, the night]. (Mughnee,
K.) [Hence, إِلَى أَنْ (followed by a mansoob
aor.) Till, or until: and إِلَى مَتَى Till, or until,
what time, or when? i. e. how long? and also to,
till, or until, the time when. See also the last
sentence in this paragraph.] ―
-b3-  [In like manner
it is used in the phrases إِلَى غَيْرِ ذلِكَ, and إِلَى آخِرِهِ,
meaning, (And so on,) to other things, and to the
end thereof; equivalent to et cœtera.] ―
-b4-  Sometimes, (S,) it occurs in the sense of مَعَ, (T, S, M,
Mughnee, K,) when a thing is joined to another
thing; (Mughnee, K;) as in the phrase [in the
Kur iii. 45 and lxi. 14], مَنْ أَنْصَارِى إِلَى اللّٰهِ [Who
will be my aiders with, or in addition to, God?],
(S, Mughnee, K,) accord. to the Koofees and
some of the Basrees; (Mughnee;) i. e. who will
be joined to God in aiding me? (M, TA;) and
as in the saying [in the Kur iv. 2], وَلَا تَأْكُلُوا
أَمْوَالَهُمْ إِلَى أَمْوَالِكُمْ [And devour not ye their possessions with, or in addition to, your possessions];
(T, S;) and [in the same, ii. 13,] وَإِذَا خَلَوْا إِلَى
شَيَا طِينِهِمْ [And when they are alone with their
devils]; (S;) and in the saying, الذَّوْدُ إِلَى الذَّوْدِ إِبِلٌ
[A few she-camels with, or added to, a few she-camels are a herd of camels], (S, Mughnee, K,) a
prov., meaning (assumed tropical:)  a little with a little makes much;
(S and A in art. ذود, q. v.;) though one may not
say, إِلَى زَيْدٍ مَالٌ meaning مَعَ زَيْدٍ مَالٌ: (Mughnee:) so too in the saying, فُلَانٌ حَلِيمٌ إِلَى أَدَبٍ وَفِقْهٍ
[Such a one is clement, or forbearing, with good
education, or polite accomplishments, and intelligence, or knowledge of the law]; (M, TA;) and
so, accord. to Kh, in the phrase, أَحْمَدُ اللّٰهَ إِلَيْكَ
[I praise God with thee: but see another rendering of this phrase below]. (ISh.) In the
saying in the Kur [v. 8], فَاغْسِلُوا وُجُوهَكُمْ وَأَيْدِيَكُمْ
إِلَى المَرَافِقِ, it is disputed whether [the meaning
be Then wash ye your faces, and your arms with
the elbows, or, and your arms as far as the
elbows; i. e., whether] the elbows be meant to be
included among the parts to be washed, or excluded therefrom. (T.) A context sometimes
shows that what follows it is included in what
precedes it; as in قَرَأْتُ القُرْآنَ مِنْ أَوَّلِهِ إِلَى آخِرِهِ
[I read, or recited, the Kurán, from the beginning
thereof to the end thereof]: or that it is excluded;
as in ثُمَّ أَتِمُّوا الصِّيَامَ إِلَى اللَّيْلِ [explained above]:
when this is not the case, some say that it is
included if it be of the same kind [as that which
precedes]; some, that it is included absolutely;
and some, that it is excluded absolutely; and this
is the right assertion; for with the context it is in
most instances excluded. (Mughnee.) ―
-b5-  It is
also used to show the grammatical agency of the
noun governed by it, after a verb of wonder; or
after a noun of excess importing love or hatred;
[as in مَا أَحَبَّهُ إِلَىَّ How lovely, or pleasing, is he
to me! (TA in art. حب,) and مَا أَبْغَضَهُ إِلَىَّ How
hateful, or odious, is he to me! (S in art. بغض;)
and] as in the saying [in the Kur xii. 33], رَبِّ
السِّجْنُ أَحَبُّ إِلَىَّ [O my Lord, the prison is more
pleasing to me]. (Mughnee, K.) [This usage is
similar to that explained in the next sentence.] ―
-b6-
It is syn. with عِنْدَ; (S, M, Mughnee, Msb, K;)
as in the phrase, هُوَ أَشْهَى إِلَىَّ مِنْ كَذَا [It is
more desirable, or pleasant, in my estimation than
such a thing]; (Msb;) and in the saying of the
poet,
أَمْ لَا سَبِيلَ إِلَى الشَّبَابِ وَذِكْرُهُ
أَشْهَى إِلَىَّ مِنَ الرَّحِيقِ السَّلْسَلِ
[Is there no way  of return to youth, seeing that
the remembrance thereof is more pleasant to me,
or in my estimation, than mellow wine?] (Mughnee, K:) and accord. to this usage of إِلَى in the
sense of عِنْدَ may be explained the saying, أَنْتِ
طَالِقٌ إِلَى سَنَةٍ, meaning Thou art divorced at the
commencement of a year. (Msb.) ―
-b7-  It is also
syn. with لِ; as in the phrase, وَالأَمْرُ إِلَيْكَ [And
command, or to command, belongeth unto Thee,
meaning God, as in the Kur xiii. 30, and xxx. 3],
(Mughnee, K,) in a trad. respecting supplication:
(TA:) or, as some say, it is here used in the
manner first explained above, meaning, is ultimately referrible to Thee: and they say, أَحْمَدُ
اللّٰهَ إِلَيْكَ, meaning, I tell the praise of God unto
thee: (Mughnee:) [but see another rendering of
this last phrase above:] you say also, ذَاكَ إِلَيْكَ
That is committed to thee, or to thy arbitration.
(Har p. 329.) ―
-b8-  It also occurs as syn. with عَلَى;
as in the saying in the Kur [xvii. 4], وَقَضَيْنَا إِلَى
بَنِى إِسْرَائِيلَ [And we decreed against the children
of Israel]: (Msb:) or this means and we revealed
to the children of Israel (Bd, Jel) decisively.
(Bd.) ―
-b9-  It is also syn. with فِى; (M, Mughnee,
K;) as in the saying [in the Kur iv. 89 and vi.12],
لَيَجْمَعَنَّكُمْ إِلَى يَوْمِ القِيَامَةِ [He will assuredly collect you together on the day of resurrection]:
(K:) thus it may be used in this instance accord.
to Ibn-Málik: (Mughnee:) and it is said to be
so used in the saying [of En-Nábighah, (M,
TA,)]
فَلَا تَتْرُكَنِّى بِالوَعِيدِ كَأَنَّنِى
إِلَي النَّاسِ مَطْلِىٌّ بِهِ القَارُ أَجْرَبُ
[Then do not thou leave me with threatening, as
though I were, among men, smeared with tar,
being like a mangy camel]; (M, Mughnee;) or,
accord. to some, there is an ellipsis and inversion
in this verse; الى being here in dependence
upon a word suppressed, and the meaning being,
smeared with pitch, [like a camel,] yet being
united to men: or, accord. to Ibn-'Osfoor, مطلىّ
is here considered as made to import the meaning
of rendered hateful, or odious; for he says that if
الى were correctly used in the sense of فى, it
it would be allowable to say, زَيْدٌإِلَى الكُوفَةِ:
(Mughnee:) [or the meaning may be, as though
I were, compared to men, a mangy camel, smeared
with pitch: for] I'Ab said, after mentioning
'Alee, عِلْمِى إِلَى عِلْمِهِ كَالقَرَارَةِ فِى المُثُعَنْجَرِ, meaning My knowledge compared to his knowledge is
like the قرارة [or small pool of water left by a
torrent] placed by the side of the middle of the
sea [or the main deep]. (K in art. ثعجر.) It is
also [said to be] used in the sense of فى in the
saying in the Kur [1xxix. 18], هَلْ لَكَ إِلَى أَنْ تَزَكَّى
[Wilt thou purify thyself from infidelity?] because it imports the meaning of invitation. (TA.)
―
-b10-  It is also used [in a manner contr. to its
primitive application, i. e.,] to denote beginning,
[or origination,] being syn. with مِنْ; as in the
saying [of a poet],
تَقُولُ وَقَدْ عَالَيْتُ بِالكُورِ فَوْقَهَا
أَيُسْقَي فَلَا يَرْوَى إِلَىَّ ابْنُ أَحْمَرَا
[She says, (namely my camel,) when I have
raised the saddle upon her, Will Ibn-Ahmar be
supplied with drink and not satisfy his thirst
from me? i. e., will he never be satisfied with
drawing forth my sweat?]. (Mughnee, K.) ―
-b11-  It
is also used as a corroborative, and is thus [syntactically] redundant; as in the saying in the Kur
[xiv. 40], فَاجْعَلْ أَفْئِدَةً مِنَ النَّاسِ تَهْوَى إِلَيْهِمْ, with
fet-h to the و [in تهوى], (Mughnee, K,) accord.
to one reading, (Mughnee,) meaning تَهْوَاهُمْ [i. e.
And make Thou hearts of men to love them]:
(K:) so says Fr: but some explain it by saying
that تهوى imports the meaning of تَمِيلُ; or that
it is originally تَهْوِى, with kesr, the kesreh being
changed to a fet-hah, and the yé to an alif, as
when one says رَضَا for رَضِىَ, and نَاصَاةٌ for نَاصِيَةٌ:
so says Ibn-Málik; but this requires consideration; for it is a condition in such cases that the
ى in the original form must be movent. (Mughnee.) [See art. هوى.] ―
-b12-  اَللّٰهُمَّ إِلَيْكَ, occurring
in a trad., [is elliptical, and] means O God, I complain unto Thee: or take Thou me unto Thee.
(TA.) ―
-b13-  And أَنَا مِنْكَ وَإِلَيْكَ means I am of thee,
and related to thee. (TA.) ―
-b14-  You say also,
اِذْهَبْ إِلَيْكَ, meaning Betake, or apply, thyself
to, or occupy thyself with, thine own affairs. (T,
K. *) And similar to this is the phrase used by
El-Aashà, فَاذْهَبِى مَا إِلَيْكِ. (TA.) And إِلَيْكُمْ
[alone is used in a similar manner, elliptically, or
as an imperative verbal noun, and] means Betake,
or apply, yourselves to, or occupy yourselves with,
your own affairs, (اِذْهَبُوا إِلَيْكُمْ,) and retire ye,
or withdraw ye, to a distance, or far away, from
us. (ISk.) And إِلَيْكَ عَنِّى means Hold, or refrain, thou from me: (T, K:) or remove, withdraw, or retire, thou to a distance from me: اليك
used in this sense is an imperative verbal noun.
(Har p. 508.) Sb says, (M,) or Akh, (Har ubi
suprà,) I heard an Arab of the desert, on its being
said to him إِلَيْكَ, reply, إِلَىَّ; as though it were
said to him Remove, withdraw, or retire, thou to
a distance, and he replied, I will remove, &c.
(M.) Aboo-Fir' own says, satirizing a Nabathæan
woman of whom he asked for water to drink,
إِذَا طَلَبْتَ المَآءِ قَالَتْ لَيْكَا
[When thou shalt demand water, she will say,
Retire thou to a distance]; meaning, [by ليكا,
i. e. لَيْكَ with an adjunct alif for the sake of
the rhyme,] إِلَيْكَ, in the sense last explained
above. (M.) ―
-b15-  One also says, إِلَيْكَ كَذَا, meaning, Take thou such a thing. (T, K.) ―
-b16-  When
إِلَى is immediately followed by the interrogative
مَا, both together are written إِلَامَ [meaning, To
what? whither? and till, or until, what time,
or when? i. e. how long?]; and in like manner
one writes عَلَامَ for عَلَى مَا, (S * and K voce ما,)
and حَتَّامَ for حَتَّى. (S voce حَتَّى.)
أَلْوَةٌ and أُلْوَةٌ and إِلْوَةٌ: see أَلِيَّةٌ.
أَلىُّ One who swears much; who utters many
oaths: (IAar, T, K:) mentioned in the K in
art. الى; but the present is its proper art. (TA.)
أَلِيَّةٌ [A falling short; or a falling short of
what is requisite, or what one ought to do; or
a flagging, or remissness; and slowness, or tardiness:] a subst. from أَلَا as signifying قَصَّرَ and
أَلِيَّةً. (M.) Hence the prov., (M,) إِلَّا حَضِيَّةً فَلَا
أَلِيَّةً, i. e. If I be not in favour, and high estimation, I will not cease seeking, and labouring,
and wearying myself, to become so: (M, K: *)
or if thou fail of good fortune in that which
thou seekest, fall not short, or flag not, or be
not remiss, in showing love, or affection, to men;
may-be thou wilt attain somewhat of that which
thou wishest: originally relating to a woman
who becomes displeasing to her husband: (S in
art. حظو:) it is one of the proverbs of women:
one says, if I be not in favour, and high estimation, with my husband, I will not fall short, or
flag, or be remiss, in that which may render me
so, by betaking myself to that which he loveth:
(T and TA in art. حظو:) Meyd says that the
two nouns are in the accus. case because the
implied meaning is إِلَّا أَكُنْ حَظِيَّةً فَلَا أَكُنْ أَلِيَّةً;
the latter noun being [accord. to him] for ↓ آلِيَةٌ,
for which it may be put for the sake of conformity
[with the former]; and the former having the
signification of the pass. part. n. of أَحْظَى, or
that of the part. n. of حَظِىَ [or حَظِيَتْ]. (Har
p. 78.)
-A2-  An oath; (T, S, M, Mgh, K;) as also
↓ أَلِيَّا (M, K) and ↓ أَلْوَةٌ (T, S, M, K) and ↓ أُلْوَةً
and ↓ إِلِيوَةٌ: (S, M, K: [in the CK, والاُلُوَّةُ مُثَلَّثَةً
is erroneously put for والِأَلْوَةُ مثلّثةً:]) it is [originally أَلِيوَةٌ,] of the measure فَعِيلَةٌ: (S:) pl. أَلَايَا.
(S, Mgh.) A poet says, (namely, Kutheiyir, TA,)
قَلِيلُا الأَلَايَا حَافِظٌ لِيَمِينِهِ
وَإِنْ سَبَقَتْ مِنْهُ الأَلِيَّةُ بَرَّتِ
[A person of few oaths, who keeps his oath from
being uttered on ordinary or mean occasions;
but if the oath has proceeded from him at any
former time, or hastily, it proves true]: (S, TA:)
or, as IKh relates it, قَلِيلُ الإِلَآءِ; meaning, he
says, قَلِيلُ الإيلَآءِ; the ى being suppressed:
see 4. (TA.)
أَلِيَّا: see the latter part of the paragraph next
preceding.
آلٍ Falling short; or falling short of what
is requisite, or what one ought to do; or flagging,
or remiss: [and slow, or tardy: &c.: see 1:]
fem. with ة: and pl. of this latter أَوَالٍ. (S, TA.)
See أَلِيَّةٌ, used, accord. to Meyd, for آلِيَة. ―
-b2-
Niggardly, penurious, or avaricious; impotent
to fulfil duties or obligations, or to pay debts.
(Har p. 78.)
مِئْلَاةٌ The piece of rag which a woman holds
in wailing, (S, TA,) and with which she makes
signs: (TA:) [it is generally dyed blue, the
colour of mourning; and the woman sometimes
holds it over her shoulders, and sometimes twirls
it with both hands over her head, or before her
face:] pl. مَآلٍ: (S, TA:) which also signifies
rags used for the menses. (TA in art. غبر.)
مُتَأَلّ [part. n. of 5]. It is said in a trad.,
وَيْلٌ لِلْمُتَأَلِّينَ مِنْ أُمَّتِى, explained as meaning
Woe to those of my people who pronounce sentence against God, saying, Such a one is in
Paradise, and such a one is in the fire [of Hell]:
but see the verb. (TA.)
