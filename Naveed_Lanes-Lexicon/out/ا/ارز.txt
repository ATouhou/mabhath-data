ارزأَرْزٌ and ↓ أُرْزٌ The pine-tree; syn. شَجَرُ الصَّنَوْبَرِ:
(K:) or this is called ↓ أَرْرَةٌ, and أَرْزٌ is the pl.:
(A 'Obeyd, S:) [or rather أَرْزٌ is a coll. gen. n.,
and أَرْزَةٌ is the n. un.:] or the male of that kind
of tree; (AHn, K;) as also ↓ أَرْزَةٌ; (K;) and
the author of the Minháj adds, it is that which
does not produce fruit; but pitch (زِفْت) is extracted from its trunks and roots, and its wood
is employed as a means of light, like as candles
are employed; and it grows not in the land of
the Arabs: A 'Obeyd says, ↓ أَرْزَةٌ is the name
of a tree well known in Syria, called with us
صَنَوْبَرٌ, because of its fruit: he says also, I have
seen this kind of tree, called أَرْزَةٌ, and it is called in
El-'Irák صَنَوْبَرٌ, but this last is the name of the fruit
of the أَرْز: (TA:) or i. q. عَرْعَرٌ [a name given to
the cypress and to the juniper-tree]. (K.) It
is said in a trad., المُجْذِيَةِ ↓ مَثَلُ الكَافِرِ مَثَلُ الأَرْزَةِ
عَلَى الأَرْضِ حَتَّى يَكُونَ آنْجِعَافُهَا بِمَرَّةٍ وَاحِدَةٍ [The
similitude of the unbeliever is the similitude of
the pine-tree standing firmly upon the ground
until it is pulled up at once]: respecting which
AA and AO say that it is ↓ الأَرَزَة, with fet-h to
the ر; meaning the tree called الأَرْزَن: but
A 'Obeyd thinks this to be a mistake, and that
it is ↓ الأَرْزَة, with the ر quiescent. (L.)

أَرَزَةٌ The tree called أَرْزَنٌ [which is a hard kind,
from which staves are made]: (AA, S, K:)
some say that it is ↓ آرِزَةٌ, of the measure فَاعِلَةٌ;
but A 'Obeyd disapproves of this. (TA.) See
also أرْزٌ.
أَرُزٌّ and ↓ أُرُزٌّ and ↓ أُرْزٌ and ↓ أُرُزٌ (S, Msb, K)
and ↓ أَرُزٌ and ↓ آرُزٌ (Kr, K) and رُزٌ (S, Msb, K) and
رُنْزٌ, (S, K,) the first of which is the form commonly obtaining among persons of distinction; the
last but one, that commonly obtaining among the
vulgar; (TA;) and the last, of the dial. of 'AbdEl-Keys; (S, TA;) [Rice;] a certain grain, (S,
K,) well known: (K:) [said in the TA to be a
species of بُرّ; but this is an improper explanation:]
there are several kinds; Egyptian and Persian and
Indian; and the best kind is the جوهرى [perhaps
a mistake for مِصْرىّ, or Egyptian]: it is cold
and dry in the second degree; or, as some say,
moderate; or, as some say, hot in the first degree;
and its husk is poisonous. (El-Minháj, TA.)
