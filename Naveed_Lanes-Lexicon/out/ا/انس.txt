(A,) aor.
اَنَسَ; (Msb, TA;) and أَنَسَ, (S, M, A,
Msb, K,) aor.
اَنِسَ (M, Msb, TA) and
اَنُسَ; (M;)
and أَنُسَ, aor.
اَنُسَ; (M, Sgh, K;) inf. n. أَنَسٌ
and أَنَسَةٌ, (S, K,) both of أَنِسَ, (S,) or إِنَسٌ,
(AZ, AHát, T, M, Msb,) also of أَنِسَ, (AZ,
AHát, Msb, TA,) but this is rare, (T, TA,)
and أُنْسٌ, (T, S, M, A, K,) which is the more
common, (T, TA,) and is of أَنَسَ, (S,) or أُنْسٌ has
a different signification from إِنْسٌ the inf. n. of
أَنِسَ, [see أُنْسٌ below,] (AZ, AHát,) or it is a
subst. from أَنِسَ بِهِ, (Msb,) and أُنْسَةٌ; (M;) [but
this also is probably a subst.;] one says أُنْسٌ and
أُنْسَةٌ, like as one says بُعْدٌ and بُعْدَة; (Ham p. 768;)
He was, or became, sociable, companionable, conversable, inclined to company or converse, friendly,
amicable, or familiar, with him, or by means of
him, and to him: and [انس به] he was, or became,
cheered, or gladdened, by his company or converse,
or by his, or its, presence; or cheerful, gay, or gladsome: the inf. n. signifying the contr. of وَحْشَةٌ: (T,
S, A, K:) or he was, or became, at ease, or tranquil,
with him: (M:) or his heart was, or became, at ease,
or tranquil, with him; without shrinking, or aversion: (Msb:) and بِهِ ↓ استأنس, (S, M, A, Msb,) and
إِلَيْهِ, (A,) and بِهِ ↓ تأنّس, signify the same, (S,
M, Msb,) i. e., the same as أَنِسَ (M, A, Msb,
TA) and أَنَسَ (M, Msb) and أُنُسَ: (M:) أَنِسَ بِفُلَانٍ
is likewise explained as signifying he delighted, or
rejoiced, in such a one; he was happy, or pleased,
with him: (IAar, TA:) [and ↓ آنسهُ, a form of frequent occurrence, inf. n. مُؤَانَسَةٌ, which occurs in
this art. in the TA, also signifies he was, or became,
sociable, &c., with him; like أَنِسَ بِهِ &c.: it is
also said in the TA that أَنِسَ بِهِ and بِهِ ↓ آنَسَ are
syn., meaning, app., like استأنس and تأنّس به,
and that آنس in this case is therefore of the
measure فَاعَلَ; but this admits of some doubt, as
it is said immediately after آنسهُ as meaning the
contr. of أَوْحَشَهُ:] and ↓ استأنس, (K, TA,) said of
a wild animal, (TA,) signifies [he became familiar,
or tame, or domesticated; or] his wildness (تَوَحُّشُهُ)
departed: (K, TA:) you say إِذَا جَآءَ اللَّيْلُ اسْتَأْنَسَ
كُلُّ وَحْشِىٍّ وَاسْتَوْحَشَ كُلُّ إِنْسِىٌ [When the night
comes, every wild animal becomes familiar with
his kind, and every human being becomes shy of
his kind, i. e., of such thereof as he does not know,
when meeting them in the dark]. (A, TA, Msb
in art. وحش.)

آنسهُ, (M, K,) inf. n. إِينَاسٌ, (S,) He behaved
in a sociable, friendly, or familiar, manner with
him; [see 1, in two places;] he, or it, cheered him,
or gladdened him, by his company or converse, or by
his, or its, presence; he, or it, solaced, or consoled,
him; contr. of أَوْحَشَهُ; (S, * K;) as also ↓ أنّسهُ,
(K,) inf. n. تَأْنِيسٌ: (S, K:) or he, or it, rendered
him easy, at ease, or tranquil; as also ↓ the latter
verb, occurring in the following ex.: سَمَّاهَا
بِالْمُؤْنِسَاتِ لِأَنَّهُنَّ يُؤَنِّسْنَهُ بِأَقْرَانِهِ فَيُؤَمِّنَّهُ أَوْيُحَسِّنَّ
ظَنِّهُ [He has called them (referring to weapons)
المؤنسات because they render him at ease with his
adversaries, and secure, or cause him to have
a good opinion of his safety, and thus, cheer him,
or solace him, by their presence]. (M: [and
the like is said in the A.])
-A2-  He perceived it;
syn. of the inf. n. إِدْرَاكٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  He saw
him, or it, (S, M, A, * Msb, K,) and looked at
him, or it; (M, TA;) as also ↓ أنّسهُ, inf. n.
تَأْنِيسٌ; (K;) and ↓ استأنسهُ: (M:) or he saw
it so that there was no doubt or uncertainty in
it: or he saw it, meaning a thing by the sight
or presence of which he was cheered, gladdened,
solaced, or consoled; إِينَاسٌ signifying إِبْصَارُ مَا
يُؤْنَسُ بِهِ: (Bd in xx. 9:) or he saw it, not having
before known it, or been acquainted with it.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  He heard it; namely, a sound or voice.
(S, K.) ―
-b3-  He felt it; was sensible of it; (M, K,
TA;) experienced it in himself; (TA;) namely,
[for instance,] fright, or fear. (A, TA.) ―
-b4-  He
knew it: (S, M, Msb, K:) he was acquainted
with it: (TA:) he had certain knowledge of it;
was certain of it. (M, TA.) You say, آنَسْتُ
مِنْهُ رُشْدًا (S, A, TA) I knew him to be characterized by رُشْد, (S, TA,) i. e., maturity of intel-lect, and rectitude of actions, and good management of affairs. (TA.) [See Kur iv. 5.] And
it is said in a prov., بَعْدَ اطِّلَاعٍ إِينَاسٌ, i. e. After
appearance [is knowledge, or certain knowledge].

استأنس, and استأنس بِهِ and إِلَيْهِ: see 1.
-A2-
استأنس signifies also He (a wild animal) became
sensible of the presence or nearness of a human
being. (S, K.)
-A3-  He looked; as in the phrase
اِذْهَبْ فَاسْتَأْنِسْ هَلْ تَرَى أَحَدًا [Go thou and look
if thou see any one]: (Fr, TA:) he considered,
or examined, endeavouring to obtain a clear knowledge of a thing; (K, TA;) and looked aside, or
about, to ascertain if he could see any one:
(TA:) he sought, or asked for, knowledge, or
information; he inquired: (M, TA:) and hence,
(Bd in xxiv. 27,) he asked permission. (Fr, Zj,
K, TA, and Bd ubi suprà.) It is said in the Kur
[xxiv. 27], لَا تَدْخُلُوا بُيُوتًا غَيْرَ بُيُوتِكُمْ حَتَّي تَسْتَأْنِسُوا
وَتُسَلِّمُوا [Enter ye not houses other than your
own houses] until ye inquire whether its inhabitants desire that ye should enter or not; [and
salute:] (M:) or (which is essentially the same,
M) until ye ask permission: (Fr, Zj, M, TA:)
but Fr says that the sentence presents an inversion,
and that the meaning is, until ye salute, and ask
if ye shall enter or not: (TA:) I'Ab says that
تَستأنسوا is a mistranscription; and he and Ubeí
and Ibn-Mes'ood read تَسْتَأْذِنُوا, which signifies
the same: (Az, TA:) [it is said that] استأنس
also signifies he made a reiterated hemming, like
a slight coughing; [as a man does to notify his
nearness;] syn. تَنَحْنَحَ: and so some explain it
in the text of the Kur quoted above. (TA.) ―
-b2-
استأنس لَهُ He listened to, or endeavoured or sought
to hear, him, or it; as also ↓ تأنّس. (A.) [See
the Kur xxxiii. 53.]
-A4-  استأنسهُ: see 4.
أُنْسٌ Sociableness; companionableness; conversableness; inclination to company or converse;
friendliness; amicableness; socialness; familiarity: cheerfulness; gayness; gladsomeness:
contr. of وَحْشَةٌ: (T, S, A, K:) joy; gladness;
happiness: (Har p. 652:) or ease, or tranquillity: (M:) or ease, or tranquillity, of heart, and
freedom from shrinking, or from aversion:
(Msb:) an inf. n. of 1, (S, M,) as are also ↓ أَنَسٌ
and ↓ أَنَسَةٌ (S, K) and ↓ إِنْسٌ, (M,) but this is
rare as signifying the contr. of وَحْشَةٌ: (T, TA:)
or ↓ إِنْسٌ is the inf. n. of أَنِسَ بِهِ; but أُنُسٌ is not:
(AZ, AHát, Msb, TA:) this latter is a subst. from
that verb [signifying as explained above]: (Msb:)
or only signifying converse, and companionship,
or familiarity, with women; (AZ, AHát, TA;)
or amatory conversation and conduct; or the talk
of young men and young women: (Fr, TA:)
[but of all the forms above, أُنْسٌ is that which
is most commonly used, at least in post-classical
works, as signifying the contr. of وَحْشَةٌ.] ―
-b2-
[Also (assumed tropical:)  Delight, as meaning a cause of delight,
or thing that gives delight.] A poet says,
يَا سَاكِنِى مَكَّةَ لَا زِلْتُمُ
أُنْسًا لَنَا إِنِّىَ لَمْ أَنْسَكُمْ
مَا فِيكُمُ عَيْبٌ سِوَى قَوْلِكُمْ
عِنْدَ اللِّقَا أَوْحَشَنَا أُنْسُكُمْ
[O inhabitants of Mekkeh, may ye not cease to
be a delight to us: verily I have not forgotten
you: there is in you no fault beside your saying,
at meeting, Your sociableness, or companiableness,
&c., has made us feel lonely and sad; meaning,
in your absence]. (TA in art. وحش.) [See
أَوْحَشَ. But this signification, though allowable
as tropical, is perhaps post-classical.] ―
-b3-  اِبْنُ أُنْس:
and فُلَانٌ ابْنُ أُنْسِ فُلَانٍ: and كَيْفَ ابْنُ أُنْسِكَ:
and كَيْفَ تَرَى ابْنَ أُنْسِكَ: see إِنْسٌ.
إِنْسٌ: see أُنْسٌ, in two places.
-A2-  (tropical:)  A chosen,
select, particular, or special, friend or companion;
(S, K;) as also اِبْنُ إِنْسٍ (S, K,) or ↓ اِبْنُ أُنْسٍ.
(So in a copy of the A.) You say, هٰذَا إِنْسِى;
(S;) and إِنْسُكَ, and ابْنُ إِنْسِكَ; (K;) (tropical:)  This is
my chosen, or particular, friend; (S;) and thy
chosen, or particular, friend. (K.) And فُلَانٌ
ابْنُ إِنْسِ فُلَانٍ (S,) or فلان ↓ ابن أُنْسِ (A,)
(tropical:)  Such a one is the chosen, or particular, friend
of such a one. (S, A.) One also says, كَيْفَ
ابْنُ إِنْسِكَ and ↓ أُنْسِكَ, (S, M,) or كَيْفَ تَرَي ابْنَ
إِنْسِكَ (AZ, Fr, A) and ↓ أُنْسِكَ, (A,) meaning himself, (AZ, Fr, S, S TA,) i. e., (assumed tropical:)  How dost thou regard
me in my companionship with thee? (S:) or
the meaning is, (tropical:)  how dost thou find thyself?
(A:) or how is thyself? (M, TA.)
-A3-  Mankind;
(S, M, A, K;) the opposite of جِنٌّ; (Msb;) as
also ↓ أَنَسٌ, (Akh, S, TA,) and ↓ إِنْسَانٌ; (A, K;)
the last being a gen. n., (Msb,) but applied to the
male (S, * Msb) and female, (S, Msb, K,) and sing.
and pl.: (Msb:) one is [also] termed ↓ إِنْسِىٌّ and
↓ أَنَسِىٌّ; (S, K;) the former of which is a rel. n.
from إِنْسٌ; (M;) [and the latter, from أَنَسٌ: the
fem. of each is with Bْ:] the vulgar apply to a
woman, instead of ↓ إِنْسَانٌ, [which is the more
approved,] ↓ إِنْسَانَةٌ: (S, K:) this latter [accord.
to some] should not be used: (S:) but it is correct, though rare: it is said in the K to occur
in poetry, but supposed to be post-classical: it
occurs, however, in classical poetry, and has been
transmitted by several authors: (MF:) the pl.
(of إِنْسٌ, M, TA) is آنَاسٌ; (M, K, TA;) and
(of the same, K in art. نوس, or of ↓ إِنْسَانٌ, M)
أُنَاسٌ, (M, K ubi suprà,) with which نَاسٌ is syn.,
(S, M, Msb, K,) being a contraction thereof; (Sb,
S, M, Msb;) and (of ↓ إِنْسِىٌّ, S, M, or ↓ أَنَسِىٌّ,
S, or of ↓ إِنْسَانٌ, Lh, S, M, Msb) أَنَاسِىٌّ, (Lh, S,
M, Msb, K,) like as كَرَاسِىُّ is pl. of كُرْسِىٌّ, or
like as سَرَاحينُ is pl. of سِرحَانٌ, but ى being
substituted for ن, (M, TA,) after the same manner as they say أَرَانٍ for أَرَانِبُ; (Fr, TA;) and
أَنَاسٍ, (Lh, M,) in the accus. case أَنَاسِىَ, as the
word is read in the Kur xxv. 51, by Ks, (TA,)
and by Yahyà Ibn-El-Hárith, (K, TA,) dropping
the ى between the second and last radical letters,
[for, with some others, it seems, they held the
word to be derived from the root نسى,] (TA,)
and أَنَاسِيَةٌ, (S, M, K,) in which the ة is a substitute for one of the two yás in أَنَاسِىُّ, a pl. of
إِنْسَانٌ; or, accord. to Mbr, أَنَاسِيَةٌ is pl. of إِنْسِىٌّ,
[in the TA, of إِنْسِيَّةٌ, which I regard as a mistranscription,] and is like زَنَادَقَةٌ for زَنَادِيقُ, and
فَرَازِتَةٌ for فَرَازِينُ; (M, TA;) and you say also
إِنْسَيُّونَ. (TA.) نَاسٌ is masc., as in the Kur
ii. 19, &c.; and sometimes fem., as meaning A
tribe, or a body of men, قَبِيلَةٌ, or طَائِفَةٌ; as in
the phrase, mentioned by Th, جَآءَتَْكَ النَّاسُ, meaning, The tribe, or portion of people (قِطْعَة), came
to thee. (M, TA.) ↓ بَنُوالإِنْسَانِ means The sons
of Adam. (M.) And النَّاسُ النَّاسُ, an expression
mentioned by Sb, means, Men in every place and
in every state are men: a poet says,
بِلَادٌ بَهَا كُنَّا وَكُنَّا نُحِبُّهَا
إِذِ النَّاسُ نَاسٌ وَالبِلَادُ بِلَادُ
meaning [A country in which we were, and
which we used to love,] since the men were ingenuous men, and the country was a fruitful
country. (M.) The following trad., لَوْ أَطَاعَ اللّٰهُ
النَّاسَ فِى النَّاسِ لَمْ يَكُنْ نَاسٌ If God complied
with the prayer of men with respect to men there
would be no men, is said to mean, that men love
to have male children born to them, and not
females, and if there were no females, or if the
females were not, men would cease to be. (TA.)
It is related that a party of the jinn, or genii,
came to a company of men, and asked permission
to go in to them, whereupon the latter said to
them, Who are ye? and they answered, نَاسٌ مِنَ
الجنِّ [A people of the jinn], making their answer
to accord. with common usage; for it is customary
for men, when it is said to them, Who are ye?
to answer, نَاسٌ مِنْ بَنِى فُلَانٍ [Men of the sons
of such a one]. (IJ, M, L: but in the L, for
ناس, in both instances, we find أُنَاسٌ.) [See also
نَاسٌ in art. نوس.] Respecting the derivation of
↓ إِنْسَانٌ, authors differ, though they agree that
the final ن is augmentative: the Basrees say that
it is from الإِنْسُ; (Msb;) and its measure is
فِعْلَانٌ; (S, Msb;) but an addition, of ى, is
made in its dim., [which is أُنَيْسِيَانٌ,] like as an
addition is made in رُوَيْجِلٌ, the dim. of رَجُلٌ:
(S:) [but it should be observed that رُوَيْجِلٌ is more
probably the dim. of رَاجِلٌ:] some say that it is
from إِينَاسٌ, signifying “perception,” or “sight,”
and “knowledge,” and “sensation;” because
man uses these faculties: (TA:) and Mohammad
Ibn-'Arafeh El-Wásitee says that men are called
إِنسِيُّونِ because they are seen (يُؤْنَسُونَ, i. e.
يُرَوْنَ), and that the jinn are called جِنّ because
they are [ordinarily] concealed (مُجْتَنُّونَ, i. e.
مُتَوَارُونَ,) from the sight of men: (TA:) [it is
said in the B, as cited in the TA, that the form
أَنِسَان is also used for إِنْسَانٌ; as though it were
a dual, meaning “a double associate,” i. e., an
associate with the jinn and with his own kind;
for it is added, أَنِسَ بِالآْجِنِّ وَأَنِسَ بِالآْخَلْقِ:] some
derive the word from النَّوْسُ, signifying “motion:”
(TA:) some (namely, the Koofees, Msb) say that
it is originally إِنسِيَانٌ, (S, Msb, TA,) of the
measure إِفْعِلَانٌ, (S, Msb,) from النِّسْيَانُ [“forgetfulness”], (Msb,) and contracted to make it
more easy of pronunciation, because of its being so
often used; (S;) but it is restored to its original
in forming the dim., (S, Msb,) which is أُنَيْسِيَانٌ:
(Msb, TA:) this form of the dim., they say,
shows the original form of the word which is its
source; (TA;) and they adduce as an indication
of its derivation the saying of I'Ab, إِنَّمَا سُمِّيَ
إِنْسَانًا لِأَنَّهُ عُهِدَ إِلَيْهِ فَنَسِىَ [He (meaning the first
man) was only named انسان because he was commanded and he forgot]: (S, TA:) [in like manner,] it is said that النَّاسُ is originally النَّاسِى; the
former of these, accord. to one reading, and the
latter accord. to another, occurs in the Kur ii. 195;
the latter referring to Adam, and to the words of
the Kur in xx. 114: (TA:) but Az holds that
إِنْسِيَانٌ is of the measure فِعْلِيَانٌ, from الإِنْسُ,
and similar to خِرْصِيَانٌ. (L, TA. *)

inhabitants of a house: (AA, TA:) pl. (of the
word in the first sense, of these three, TA, and in

also, هُمْ أَنَسُ فُلَانٍ They are they with whom such
a one is sociable (اَلَّذِينَ يَسْتَأْنِسُ إِلَيْهِمْ). (Lh, M.)

-b2-  A human being; a man; as also
↓ أَنَسِىٌّ, (S, K,) and ↓ إِنْسَانٌ. (S, A, Msb, K.) See
إِنْسٌ, in two places. ―
-b3-  [Domestic, as opposed to
wild. Ex.] حُمُرٌ إِنْسِيَّةٌ Domestic asses; asses that
are accustomed to the houses: commonly known as
written with kesr to the أُنْسِيَّةٌ: but in the book of
Aboo-Moosà is an indication of its being with
damm to the ء [أَنَسِيَّةٌ]: and as some relate a trad.
in which it occurs, أَنَسِيَّةٌ, which is said to be of no
account. (TA.) ―
-b4-  The left side (AZ, S, M, Msb,
K) of an animal, (Msb,) or of a beast and of a
man, (M,) or of anything: (AZ, S, K:) or the
right side: (As, S:) [but the latter seems to be a
mistake:] Az says that Lth has well explained
this term and its contrary وَحْشِىٌّ, saying that the
latter is the right side of every beast; and the
former, the left side; agreeably with those of the
first authority in sound learning; and [that] it is
related of El-Mufaddal and As and AO, that all
of them asserted the latter to be, of every animal
except man, [the “far” side, or “off” side,] the
side on which it is not milked nor mounted; and
the former, [the near side,] the side on which the
rider mounts and the milker milks: (TA in art.
وحش:) [and the like is said, as a citation from Az,
in the Msb in art. وحش: but after this, in my
copy of the Msb, there seems to be an omission;
for it is immediately added, “But Az says, This
is not correct in my opinion:”] it is said that
everything that is frightened declines to its right
side; for the beast is approached to be mounted
and milked on the left side, and, fearing thereat,
runs away from the place of fear, which is the left
side, to the place of safety, which is the right side:
(S, * IAmb in Msb; both in art. وحش:) [accordingly,] Er-Rá'ee describes a beast as declining
to the side termed الوحشى because frightened on
the left side: (S and Msb in art. وحش:) and
'Antarah alludes to one's shrinking with the side
so termed from the whip, [which he likens to a
cat,] because the whip of the rider is in his right
hand: (S in art. وحش:) but Abu-l-'Abbás says
that people differ respecting these two terms when
relating to a man: that, accord. to some, they
mean the same in this case as in the cases of horses
and other beasts of carriage, and of camels: but
some say, that in the case of a man, the latter term
means the part next the shoulder-blade; and the
former, the part next the arm-pit. (TA in art.
وحش.) Of every double member of a man, as the
upper half of each arm, and the two fore arms,
and the two feet, it means That [side] which is
towards the man; and وحشىّ, that which turns
away from him: (As, S:) or, of the foot, the
former means that [side] which is towards the
other foot; [i. e., the inner side;] and the latter,
the contrary of the former. (TA in art. وحش.)
Of a bow, (S, M, K,) or of a Persian bow, (TA in
art. وحش,) That [side] which is towards thee;
(S, K;) and وحشىّ, the back: (S and K in art.
وحش:) or the former, that [side] which is next to
the archer; and the latter, that which is next to
the animal shot at: (M, TA:) or of a bow, whether
Persian or not is not said, [the former means the
side against which the arrow lies; and] the latter,
the side against which the arrow does not lie.
