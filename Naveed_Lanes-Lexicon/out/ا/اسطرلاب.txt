اسطرلابأَسْطُرْلَابٌ or أُسْطُرْلَابٌ, [accord. to different copies
of the K,] and with ص in the place of س,
[from the Greek
ἀστρολαβόν, An astrolabe: a
word of which F gives the following fanciful
derivation:] لاب was a man who traced some
lines, and founded upon them calculations; whence
أَسْطُرُلَابٍ [the lines of Láb], from which was
formed the compound word اسطرلاب, and
اصطرلاب, the س being changed into ص because
of the ط following. (K in art. لوب.) It is either
an arabicized or a post-classical word: accord. to
the Niháyet el-Adab, the names of all the instruments by which time is known, whether by means
of calculation or water or sand, are foreign to the
Arabic language. (MF.)
