امر1
أَمَرَهُ, (T, S, M, &c.,) aor.
اَمُرَ, (M, &c.,) inf. n.
أَمْرٌ (T, S, M, Msb, K) and إِمَارٌ, (M, L, K,)
which latter, however, is disapproved by MF,
(TA,) and إِيمَارٌ is syn. therewith, (K,) but this
also is disapproved by MF, and deemed by him
strange, [being by rule the inf. n. of ↓ آمَرَهُ, respecting which see what follows,] (TA,) and آمِرَةٌ,
(M, K,) which is one of the inf. ns. [or quasiinf. ns.] of the measure فَاعِلَةٌ, like عَافِيَةٌ and عَاقِبَةٌ,
(M,) He commanded him; ordered him; bade
him; enjoined him; the inf. n. signifying the
contr. of نَهْىٌ; (T, M, K;) as also ↓ آمرهُ, (Kr,
M, K,) mentioned by A'Obeyd also as a dial.
var. of أمَرَهُ: (Msb:) but A'Obeyd says that
آمَرْتُهُ and أَمرْتُهُ are syn. [in a sense different from
that explained above, i. e.] as meaning كَثَّرْتُهُ.
(TA.) You say, أَمَرَهُ بِهِ, (S, M, K,) and أَمَرَهُ إِيَّاهُ,
suppressing the prep., (M,) He commanded,
ordered, bade, or enjoined, him to do it. (M, K.)
And أمَرْتُكَ أَنْ تَفْعَلَ, and لِتَفْعَلَ, and بِأنْ تَفْعَلَ,
I commanded, ordered, bade, or enjoined, thee to
do [such a thing]. (M.) [And أَمَرَهُ بِكَذَا as
meaning He commanded him, or ordered him, to
make use of such a thing; or the like: whence,
in a trad.,] أُمِرْتُ بِالسِّوَاكِ [I have been commanded
to make use of the tooth-stick]. (El-Jámi' es-
Sagheer.) [And He enjoined him such a thing;
as, for instance, patience.] The imperative of
أَمَرَ is مُرْ; originally اؤْمُرْ; which also occurs
[with وَ in the place of ؤ when the ا is pronounced
with damm]: (M:) but [generally] when it is
not preceded by a conjunction, (Msb,) i. e., by
وَ or فَ, (T,) you suppress the ء, [i. e. the radical
ء, and with it the conjunctive ا preceding it,]
contr. to rule, and say, مُرْهُ بِكَذَا [Command, or
order, or bid, or enjoin, thou him to do such a
thing]; like as you say, كُلْ and خُذْ: when,
however, it is preceded by a conjunction, the
practice commonly obtaining is, to restore the وَأْمُرْ بِكَذَا,
agreeably with analogy, and thus to say, أَمُرْ بِكَذَا.
(Msb.) ―
-b2-  [You say also, أَمَرَ بِهِ فَقُتِلَ He gave
an order respecting him, and accordingly he was
slain. And أَمَرَ لَهُ بِكَذَا He ordered that such a
thing should be done, or given, to him.] ―
-b3-  In the
Kur [xvii. 17], أَمَرْنَا مُتْرَفِيهَا فَفَسَقُوا فِيهَا, so accord.
to most of the readers, (T, &c.,) means We commanded [its luxurious inhabitants] to obey, but
they transgressed therein, or departed from the
right way, or disobeyed: (Fr, T, S, &c.:) so says
Aboo-Is-hák; adding that, although one says,
أَمَرتُ زَيْدًا فَضَرَبَ عَمْرًا, meaning I commanded
Zeyd to beat 'Amr, and he beat him, yet one also
says, أَمَرْتُكَ فَعَصَيْتَنِى [I commanded thee, but thou
disobeyedst me]: or, accord. to some, the meaning
is, We multiplied its luxurious inhabitants; (T;)
and this is agreeable with another reading, namely,
↓ آمَرْنَا; (TA;) and a reading of El-Hasan, namely,
أَمِرْنَا, like عَلِمْنَا, may be a dial. var., of the same
signification: (M:) see 4, in two places: or it
may be from الإِمَارَةُ; (S, TA;) [in which case it
seems that we should read ↓ أَمَّرْنَا; or, perhaps,
أَمَرْنَا: see 2:] Abu-l-'Áliyeh reads ↓ أَمَّرْنَا, and
this is agreeable with the explanation of I'Ab,
who says that the meaning is, We made its chiefs
to have authority, power, or dominion. (TA.)
―
-b4-  أَمَرَهُ, aor.
اَمُرَ, also signifies He commanded,
ordered, bade, or enjoined, him to do that which
it behooved him to do. (A.) [He counselled, or
advised, him.] One says, مُرْنِى, meaning Counsel
thou me; advise thou me. (A.) ―
-b5-  أَمَرَ بِاقْتِنَاصٍ, said
of a wild animal, means He rendered the beholder
desirous of capturing him. (M.)
-A2-  أَمَرَ, (As, Fr,

أَمُرَ, aor.
اَمُرَ; (S, M, IKtt, K;) and أَمِرَ, aor.
اَمَرَ; (M,
K, and several other authorities; but by some
this is disallowed; TA;) inf. n. أَمْرٌ (K) and إِمْرَةٌ
(S) and إِمَارَةٌ; (As, T, S;) or the second is a
simple subst.; (K;) or perhaps it is meant in the
S that this and the third are quasi-inf. ns.; (MF;)
He had, or held, command; he presided as a
commander, governor, lord, prince, or king; (M,
Msb, K;) he became an أَمِير; (As, T, S;) عَلَى
القَوْمِ over the people. (M, * Msb, K.) [See also 5.]
أَمَرَ فُلَانٌ وَأُمِرَ عَلَيْهِ, or عليه ↓ وأُمِّرَ, (as in different
copies of the S,) [Such a one has held command
and been commanded,] is said of one who has
been a commander, or governor, after having been
a subject of a commander, or governor; meaning
such a one is a person of experience; or one who
has been tried, or proved and strengthened, by
experience. (S.)
-A3-  أَمَرَهُ as syn. with آمَرَهُ: see 4.
-A4-  أَمِرَ, (S, M, Msb, K,) aor.

of such a one multiplied; or became many, or

2
أمّرهُ, inf. n. تَأْمِيرٌ, He made him, or appointed him, commander, governor, lord, prince,
or king. (S, * Mgh, Msb.) [And it seems to be
indicated in the S that ↓ أَمَرَهُ, without teshdeed,
signifies the same.] See 1, in three places. You

(S, K,) He consulted him respecting his affair,
or case; (T, * S, M, Msb, K, * TA;) as also وَامَرَهُ;

inf. n. اسْتِئْمَارٌ; (S, K;) and ↓ ائتمرهُ, (T,) inf. n.

right, but in which often is found his destruction:

consideration, and without looking to its result.
(A 'Obeyd, T.) [See what follows.] ―
-b2-  He undertook a thing without consulting; (Kt, T;) as
though his soul, or mind, ordered him to do it

اختصموا and تخاصموا: (T:) or ائتمروا عَلَى الأَمْرِ

or enjoin ye, one another to do good: [such is
app. the meaning,] but God best knoweth: (T:)

chiefs command one another respecting thee, to
slay thee: (Zj, T:) or consult together against

thee, to slay thee: (Kt, T:) but the last but
one of these explanations is better than the last.

إِسْتَاْمَرَ see 3, in two places.
أَمْرٌ A command; an order; a bidding; an
injunction; a decree; an ordinance; a prescript:
(S, * Msb, * TA, &c.:) pl. أَوَامِرُ: (S, Msb, &c.:)
so accord. to common usage; and some writers
of authority justify and explain it by saying that
أَمْرٌ is [originally] مَأْمُوُرٌ بِهِ; that it is then changed
to the measure فَاعِلٌ; [i. e., to آمِرٌ;] like أَمْرٌ عَارِفٌ,
which is originally مَعْرُوفٌ; and عِيشَةٌ راضِيَةٌ, originally مَرْضِيَّةٌ; &c.; [and then, to أَمْرٌ;] and that
فَاعِلٌ becomes in the pl. فَوَاعِلُ; so that أَوَامَرُ is
the pl. of مَإْمُورٌ: others say that it has this form
of pl. to distinguish it from أَمْرٌ in the sense of
حَالٌ [&c.], in which sense it has for its pl. أُمُورٌ.
(Msb, TA.) [But I think that أَوَامِرُ may be
properly and originally pl. of آمِرَةٌ, for آيَةٌ آمِرَةٌ, or
the like. MF says that, accord. to the T and M,
the pl. of أَمْرٌ in the sense explained in the beginning of this paragraph is أُمُورٌ: but he seems to
have founded his assertion upon corrupted copies
of those works; for in the M, I find nothing on
this point; and in the T, not, as he says, الأَمْرُضِدُّ
النَّهْىَ وَاحِدُ الأُمُور, but قَالَ اللَّيْثُ الأَمْرُ مَعْرُوفٌ
نَقِيضُ النَّهْىِ وَاحِدُ الأُمُورِ, evidently meaning
that أَمْرٌ signifies the contr. of نَهْىٌ, and is also, in
another sense, the sing. of أُمُورٌ.] [Hence,] أُولُو
الأَمْرِ Those who hold command or rule, and the
learned men. (M, K. [See Kur iv. 62.]) And
أَمْرُاللّٰهِ The threatened punishment of God: so
in the Kur x. 25, and xi. 42, and xvi.1; in which
last place occur the words, أَتَي أَمْرُ اللّٰهِ فَلَا تَسْتَعْجِلُوهُ,
meaning The threatened punishment ordained of
God hath, as it were, come: so near is it, that it
is as though it had already come: therefore desire
not ye to hasten it. (Zj, M, TA.) And The purpose of God. (Bd and Jel in lxv. 3; &c.) And
الأَمْرُ قَرِيبٌ The resurrection, or the time thereof,
is near. (Mgh, from a trad.) And مَا فَعَلْتُهُ عَنْ
أَمْرِى, in the Kur xviii. 81, I did it not of my
own judgment: (Bd:) or, of my own choice.
(Jel.) [Hence also الأَمْرُ, in grammar, signifies
The imperative form of a verb.] ―
-b2-  Also A thing;
an affair; a business; a matter; a concern: a
state, of a person or thing, or of persons or things
or affairs or circumstances; a condition; a case:
an accident; an event: an action: syn. شَأْنٌ:
(M, F, TA:) and حَالٌ, (Msb, TA,) and حَالَةٌ:
(Msb:) and حَادِثَةٌ: (K:) and فِعْلٌ: (MF, TA:)
and a thing that is said; a saying: (TA voce
أُولُو, at the end of art. ال:) pl. أُمُورٌ; (S, M, K,
&c.;) its only pl. in the senses here explained.
(TA.) You say, أَمْرُ فُلَانٍ مُسْتَقِيمٌ [The affair,
or the like, of such a one is in a right state]: and
امُورُهُ مُسْتَقِيمَةٌ [His affairs are in a right state].
(S, A.) And شَتَّتَ أَمْرَهُ He dissipated, disorganized, disordered, unsettled, or broke up, his state
of things, or affairs. (As, TA in art. شعب.)
[امر seems to be here used, as in many other
instances, rather in the sense of the pl. than in that
of the sing.] ―
-b3-  أَمْرٌ كُلِّىٌّ [A universal, or general,
prescript, rule, or canon]. (Msb voce قَاعِدَةٌ, KT
voce قَانُونٌ, &c.)
إِمْرٌ a subst. from أَمِرَالِأَمْرُ in the sense of اِشْتَدَّ;
(S;) or a subst. from أَمِرَ as signifying كَثُرَ and
تَمَّ; (M;) (assumed tropical:)  [A severe, a distressful, a grievous,
or an afflictive, thing: or] a terrible, and foul,
or very foul, thing: or a wonderful thing. (TA,)
Hence, [used as an epithet, like أَمِرٌ, q. v.,] in the
Kur [xviii. 70], لَقَدْ جِئْتَ شَيْئًا إِمْرًا (assumed tropical:)  Verily thou
hast done a severe, a distressful, a grievous, or
an afflictive, thing: (S:) or a terrible, and foul,
or very foul, thing: (TA:) or a wonderful
thing: (S:) or an abominable, a foul, or an
evil, and a wonderful, thing: (Ks, M, K: *) or
a terrible and an abominable thing; signifying
more than نَكْرًا, [which occurs after, in verse 73,]
inasmuch as the [presumed] drowning of the persons in the ship was more abominable than the
slaying of one person: (Zj, T:) or a crafty,
and an abominable, or a foul, or an evil, and a
wonderful, thing; and derived from أَمِرَ القَوْمُ as
meaning كَثُرُوا. (Ks.)
أَمَرٌ a coll. gen. n. of which أَمَرَةٌ (q. v.) is the
n. un.
-A2-  See also تَأْمُورٌ.
أَمِرٌ: see إِمَّرٌ.
-A2-  (assumed tropical:)  Multiplied; or become many,
or much, or abundant. (M, K.) [See أَمِرَ.] You
say زَرْعٌ أَمِرٌ (assumed tropical:)  Abundant seed-produce. (Lh, M.)
―
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  A man whose beasts have multiplied, or
become many or abundant. (M.) (assumed tropical:)  A man blessed,
or prospered, (Ibn-Buzurj, M, K, *) in his property: (M:) fem. with ة. (Ibn-Buzurj.) And
with ة, (assumed tropical:)  A woman blessed to her husband [by her
being prolific]: from the signification of كَثْرَةٌ.
(M.)
-A3-  (assumed tropical:)  Severe; distressful; afflictive. (TA.)
[See also إِمْرٌ.]
أَمْرَةٌ A single command, order, bidding, or injunction: as in the saying, لَكَ عَلَىَّ أَمْرَةٌ مُطَاعَةٌ
Thou hast authority to give me one command,
order, bidding, or injunction, which shall be
obeyed by me. (S, M, * A, Msb, K.) You should
not say, [in this sense,] إِمْرَةٌ, with kesr. (T, S.)
-A2-  See also إِمْرَةٌ.
إِمْرَةٌ a subst. from أَمَرَ [q. v.]; Possession of
command; the office, and authority, of a commander, governor, lord, prince, or king; (M, *
Msb, K;) as also ↓ إِمَارَةٌ (Mgh, Msb, K) and
↓ أَمَارَةٌ; (L, K;) but this last is by some disallowed, and is said in the Fs and its Expositions
to be unknown. (MF.) It is said in a trad.,
لَعَلَّكَ سآءَ تْكَ إِمْرَةُ ابْنِ عَمِّكَ Perhaps thy paternal
uncle's son's possession of command hath displeased thee. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [And hence, (assumed tropical:)  Increase,
or abundance, or the like; as also other forms
mentioned in what follows.] You say, فِى وَجْهِ
مَالِكَ تَعْرِفُ إِمْرَتَهُ (assumed tropical:) In the face of thy property,
[meaning such as consists in camels or the like,
and also money,] thou knowest its increase and
abundance, and its expense: (S:) or ↓ إِمَّرَتَهُ, and
↓ إِمّرَتَهُ, which latter is a dial. var. of weak
authority, and ↓ أَمَّرَتَهُ, i. e., its increase and abundance: (M:) or ↓ إِمَّرَتَهُ as meaning its prosperous
state; as also ↓ أَمَارَتَهُ, and ↓ أَمْرَتَهُ: (Ibn-Buzurj:)
accord. to AHeyth, who reads ↓ تُعْرَفُ إِمَّرَتُهُ, the
meaning is, its decrease; but the correct meaning
is, its increase, as Fr explains it. (T, TA.) It is
said respecting anything of which one knows what
is good in it at first sight: (Lh, M:) and means,
on a thing's presenting itself, thou knowest its
goodness. (T.) One says also, ↓ مأَحْسَنَ أَمَارَتَهُمْ
(assumed tropical:)  How good is their multiplying, and the multiplying of their offspring and of their number!
(M.) And ↓ لَا جَعَلَ اللّٰهُ فِيهِ إِمَّرَةً (assumed tropical:)  May God
not make an increase to be therein. (T.)
أَمَرَةٌ Stones: (K:) [or a heap of stones:] or
it is the n. un. of أَمَرٌ, which signifies stones:
(M:) or the latter signifies stones set up in order
that one may be directed thereby to the right way:
(Ham p. 409:) and the former also signifies a hill;
(M, K;) and أَمَرٌ is [used as] its pl.: (M:) and
a sign, or mark, by which anything is known;
(M, K;) as also ↓ أَمَارٌ and ↓ أَمَارَةٌ; (As, S;) and
أَمَرٌ is [used as] its pl. in this sense also: (M:)
or a sign, or mark, set up to show the way;
(AA, Fr;) as also ↓ أَمَارٌ and ↓ أَمَارَهٌ: (K:) or
a small sign, or mark, of stones, to show the way,
in a waterless desert; (S;) as also ↓ أَمَارٌ [and
↓ أَمَارَةٌ]; and any sign, or mark, that is prepared:
(TA:) or a structure like a مَنَارَة [here app.
meaning a tower of a mosque], upon a mountain,
wide like a house or tent, and larger, of the
height of forty times the stature of a man, made
in the time of 'Ád and Irem; in some instances
its foundation being like a house, though it consists only of stones piled up, one upon another,
cemented together with mud, appearing as though
it were of natural formation: (ISh, T:) the pl.
(in all the senses above, K) [or rather the coll.
gen. n.,] is أَمَرٌ. (S, K.)
-A2-  See also إِمْرَةٌ.
أَمَارٌ and ↓ أَمَارَةٌ A sign, mark, or token. (As,
S Mgh.) See also each voce أَمَرَةٌ, in three places.
You say, هِى أَمَارَةُ مَا بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَكَ It is a sign, or
token, of what is between me and thee. (T, * TA.)
And a poet says,
إِذَا طَلَعَتْ شَمْسُ النَّهَارِ فَإِنَّهَا
أَمَارَةُ تَسْلِيمِى عَلَيْكِ فَسَلِّمِى
[When the sun of day rises, it is a sign of my
saluting thee, therefore do thou salute]. (TA.) ―
-b2-
Also A time: (As, S, K:) so IAar explains the
latter word, not particularizing the time as definite
or otherwise: (M:) or a definite time: (TA:) or
a time, or place, of promise or appointment; an
appointed time or place; syn. مَوْعِدٌ: (M, Mgh,
K:) or, accord. to some, the former word is pl.
[or rather col. gen. n.] of the latter. (TA.) El-
'Ajjáj says,
إِذْ رَدَّهَا بِكَيْدِهِ فَارْتَدَّتِ
إِلَي أَمَارٍ وَأَمَارِ مُدَّتِى
When He (meaning God) brings it, (namely my
soul,) by his skilful ordering, and his power,
[and it is thus brought, or it thus comes, to a set
time, and] to the time of the end of my appointed
period: امارمدّتى being as above; the former
word being prefixed to the latter, governing it
in the gen. case. (IB. [In the S we find وَأَمَارٌ
