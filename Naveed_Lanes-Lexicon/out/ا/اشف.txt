(TA:) the instrument for boring, or perforating,
(K in art. شفى) belonging to the أَسَاكِفَة; said
by ISk to be that which is used for water-skins,
or milk-skins, and leather water-bags, and the
like; that used for sandals, or shoes, being called
مِخْصَفٌ: (S and TA in art. شفى:) and the
[instrument called] سِرَاد with which skin, or
leather, is sewed: (K in art. شفى:) i. q. مِخْرَزٌ:
(Mgh in art. شفى:) pl. أَشَافٍ (S, Mgh, Msb,

in the present art., الإِسْكَافُ is put, by a mistake
of the copyists, for لِلْإِسْكَافِ (TA.) See also art.
