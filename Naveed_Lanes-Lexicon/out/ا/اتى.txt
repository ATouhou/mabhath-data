أَتَى, aor. يَأْتِى, (Msb,) and, in the dial. of
Hudheyl, يَأْت, without ى; (S;) and أَتَيْتُهُ, (T, S,
M, Msb, K,) [aor. آتِيهِ;] and in the imperative,
some of the Arabs say, تِ, suppressing the ا, like
as is done in خُذْ and كُلْ and مُرْ; (IJ, M;) inf.
n. إِتْيَانٌ, (T, S, * M, Mgh, Msb, K,) or this is a
simple subst., (Msb.) and إِتْيَانَةٌ, (M, K,) which
should not be used as an inf. n. of un., unless by
a bad poetic licence, (Lth, T,) and أَتْىٌ (T, S, M,
Msb, K) and أُتِىٌ and إِتِىٌ and مَأْتَاةٌ; (M, K;) He
[or it] came; (Msb;) and I came to him, or it;
(S, M, Mgh, * Msb, K;) or was, or became, present

يَأْتُو; (Msb;) and أَتَوْتُهُ, (T, S, M, K), aor. آتُوهُ:
(S:) for which reason, we assign the generality of
the words mentioned in art. اتو to the present art.
also. (M.) [Accord. to the authorities here indicated for the signification of أَتَى, this verb and جَآءَ
are syn.: some attempt to distinguish them; but
contradict one another in so doing: the slight
distinctions that exist between them will be best
seen by a comparison of the exs. in this art. with
those in art. جيأ:] accord. to Er-Rághib, the proper
[or primary] signification of الإِتْيَانُ is The coming
with ease. (TA.) ―
-b2-  أَتَاهَا, (Mgh, Msb,) inf. n.
إِتْيَانٌ, (Msb,) [lit. He came to her,] means (assumed tropical:)  he
lay with her; syn. جَامَعَهَا; (Mgh, Msb;) namely,
a woman, (Mgh,) or his wife. (Msb.) Hence
an expression in the Kur xxvi. 165. (TA.) ―
-b3-
أَتَى القَوْمَ [He came to the people: and hence,] he
asserted his relationship to the people, not being
of them. (Msb.) [See أَتِىُّ in art. اتو.] ―
-b4-  أَتَي بِهِ
[He came with, or brought, him, and it; or] he
made him (a man), and it (a thing, such, for instance, as property), to come. (Kull.) [See also
4: and see, in what follows, other significations
of أَتَى trans. by means of بِ. Hence, أَتَى بِوَلَدٍ
He begot a child, or children. And أَتَتْ بِهِ She
brought him forth; gave birth to him.] Accord.
to Aboo-Is-hák, the meaning of the words in the
Kur [ii. 143] أَيْنَمَا تَكُونُوا يَأْتِ بِكُمُ اللّٰهُ جَمِيعًا is,
Wherever ye be, God will bring you all back unto
Himself. (M.) [You say also, أَتَى بِبَيِّنَةٍ He adduced a proof.] See also 3. ―
-b5-  أَتَى الأَمْرَ [He
entered into, engaged in, or occupied himself with,
the thing, or affair: and, as also أَتَى بِهِ,] he did,
executed, or performed, the thing, or affair; (M.
K;) and in like manner, الذَّنْبَ, [and بَالذَّنْبِ,]
the crime, sin, or offence. (M.) It is said in the
Kur [ix. 54], وَلَا يَأْتُونَ الصَّلَاةَ إِلَّا وَهُمْ كُسَالَى,
meaning And they do not enter into, or engage in,
prayer, unless when they are heavy, or sluggish.
(TA.) And you say, أَتَى الفَاحِشَهَ, [and بِالفَاحِشَةِ,
(see Kur iv. 23 and lxv. 1,)] He entered into,
engaged in, or occupied himself with, [or he did,
or committed,] that which was excessively foul or
evil. (TA.) And أَتَى بِالجَيِّدِ مِنْ قَوْلٍ أَوْ فِعْلٍ
[He said, gave utterance to, uttered, or expressed,
or he brought to pass, did, or effected, what was
good, or excellent; he said, or did, well, or excel-lently]. (Msb in art. جود.) And أَتَى بِجَرْىِ بَعْدَ
جَرْىٍ[He (a horse) performed, or fetched, run
after run]. (S in art. تأم, &c.) ―
-b6-  وَلَا يُفْلِحُ السَّاحِرُ
حَيْثُ أَتَى[in the Kur xx. 72] means حَيْثُ كَانَ
[And the enchanter shall not prosper where he is,
or wherever he may be]; (M, Bd, K;) and where
he cometh: (Bd:) or حَيْثُ أَتَى بِسِحْرِهِ[where he
cometh with his enchantment; or where he performeth his enchantment]: (Jel:) and it is said to
mean that where the enchanter is, he must be
slain: such is the doctrine of the lawyers. (M.)
―
-b7-  Z mentions that أَتَىoccurs in the sense of صَارَ
[He, or it, became; like as we sometimes say,
he, or it, came, or came to be]; like جَآءَin the
saying, جَآءَ البِنَآءُ مُحْكَمًا. (Kull.) [So you say,
البِنَآءُ مُحْكَمًاThe building became, or came to
be, firm, strong, or compact.] ―
-b8-  The saying, in
the Kur [xvi. 1], أَتَى أَمْرُ آللّٰهِ فَلَا تَسْتَعْجِلُوهُmeans
[The threatened punishment ordained of God hath
approached: therefore desire not ye to hasten it:]
its coming hath approached. (TA.) [And in like
manner,] أُتِىَ فُلَانٌ, like عُنِىَ, means Such a one
was approached by the enemy come in sight of
him. (K.) أُتِيتَ يَا فُلَانٌ[Thou art approached
&c., O such a one,] is said when one is warned of
an enemy that has come in sight of him. (Sgh,
TA.) And أَتَى عَلَيْهِمُ العَدُوُّmeans The enemy came
to them, [or came down upon them, for, as MF
observes, أَتَىwhen trans. by means of عَلَىseems
to imply the meaning of نَزَلَ,] overcoming, or
overpowering, them. (Bd in xviii. 40.) ―
-b9-  Hence,
أَتَى عَلَيْهِ[and أَتَاهُ, as will be seen by what follows,] (assumed tropical:)  He destroyed him, or it. (Bd ubi suprà.)
And hence, from إِتْيَانُ العَدُوِّ, (Mgh,) أَتَى عَلَيْهِ
الدَّهْرُ(tropical:)  Time, or fortune, destroyed him. (M,
Mgh, Msb, K.) Destruction is meant in the Kur
[lix. 2], where it is said, فأَتاهُمُ اللّٰهُ مِنْ حيْثُ لَمْ
يَحْتَسِبُوا(assumed tropical:)  [But God brought destruction upon them
whence they did not reckon, or expect]. (EsSemeen, TA.) And it is said in the Kur [xvi. 28],
فَأَتَى اللّٰهُ بُنْيَانَهُمْ مِنَ القَوَاعِدِ, i. e. (assumed tropical:)  But God
removed their building from the foundations, and
demolished it upon them, so that He destroyed
them. (TA.) أَتَى عَلَيْهِalso signifies (assumed tropical:)  He caused
it to come to an end; made an end of it; consumed it; [devoured it;] exhausted it; came to,
or reached, the end of it; namely, a thing; (Kull;)
as, for instance, what was in a bowl; (K in art.
جردم;) and what was in a vessel; (K in art.
جرجب;) like فَرَغَ مِنْهُ: (ISd cited in the TA in
art. نكش:) or i. q. مَرَّ بِهِ[which may be rendered
he went away with it; but this, as an explanation
of أَتَى عَلَيْهِ, has another meaning, which see in
what follows]. (Kull.) And one says, أُتِىَ فُلَانٌ
مِنْ مَأْمَنِهِ(assumed tropical:)  Destruction came to such a one from
the quarter whence he felt secure. (TA.) And
أُتِىَ عَلَي يَدِ فُلَانٍ(assumed tropical:)  Property belonging to such a
one perished. (T.) And يُؤْتَى دُونَهُ(assumed tropical:) He is taken
away, or carried off, and overcome. (TA.) A
poet says,
أَتَى دُونَ حُلْوِالعَيْشِ حَتَّى أَمَرَّهُ
نُكُوبٌ عَلَي آثَارِهِنَّ نُكُوبُ
meaning (assumed tropical:)  [Misfortunes, in the footsteps of which
were misfortunes,] took away [what was sweet, of
life, and rendered it bitter]. (TA.) One says
also, مِنْ هٰهُنَا أُتِيَتْ, [so I find it written, but I
think that the last word should be أُتِيتَ, agreeably
with a preceding phrase from the T,] (assumed tropical:)  Hence the
trial, or affliction, came in upon thee. (Mgh.)
And أُتِىَ مِنْ جِهَةِ كَذَا, with the verb in the
passive form, (assumed tropical:)  He missed [his object in respect of
such a thing] by laying hold upon it when it
was not fit to be laid hold upon. (Msb.) And
أُتِىَ الرَّجُلُ, [also] like عُنِىَ, (assumed tropical:)  The man was
deceived, or deluded, and his faculty of sense
became altered to him, so that he imagined that to
be true which was not true. (TA.) ―
-b10-  أَتَى عَلَيْهِ
is also syn. with مَرَّ بِهِ[meaning He, or it, (as,
for instance, a period of time,) passed by him, or
over him]. (Msb.) You say, أَتَ عَلَيْهِ حَوْلٌ[A
year passed over him; or he became a year old].
(S, K, Msb, in art. حول; &c.) ―
-b11-  أَتَتِ النَّاقَهُ, and

saying, in the Kur [xxi. 48], وَإِنْ كَانَ مِثْقَالَ
بِهَا ↓ حَبَّةٍ مِنْ خَرْدَلٍ أَتَيْنَا, some read thus, (M, *
TA,) meaning [Though it be the weight of a
grain of mustard,] we will bring it [forward for
requital]: others read بها↓ آتَيْنَا, meaning we will
give [a recompense] for it; in which case the
verb is of the measure أَفْعَلَ: or we will requite
for it; in which case the verb is of the measure
فَاعَلَ. (M, TA.) ―

is of the dial. of the people of El-Yemen, inf. n.
مُوَاتَاةٌ; and is the form commonly current: (Msb:)
but it should not be used, except in the dial. of
the people of El-Yemen. (T.) ―
-b3-  [Hence, app.,

(Ksh, TA;) he made, or caused, it (a thing) to

Kur [xviii. 61], آتِنَا غَدآءَ نَا, i. e. اِيتِنَا[Come
thou to us with, or bring thou to us, our morningmeal]. (S.) ―
-b2-  Hence, (Ksh, TA,) inf. n. as
above, (T, S,) He gave him (T, S, M, Msb, K) a
thing, (M, K,) or property: (Msb:) and you

-b3-  آتَيْتُ المُكَاتَبَI made a gift to the slave between whom and me was a contract that he should
become free on payment of a certain sum: or I

تأتّى لَهُIt (an affair, T, Mgh, Msb, K, or a
thing, S, M) was, or became, prepared, disposed,
arranged, or put into a good or right state, for
him; (T, * S, M, Mgh, Msb, K;) and hence, it

way thereof (i. e. of an affair) was, or became,

it is feasible or practicable, and easy, to me to
chew. (Mgh). ―
