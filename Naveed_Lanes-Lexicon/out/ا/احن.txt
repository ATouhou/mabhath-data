احن1
أَحِنَ (S, Msb, K) عَلَيْهِ, (S, TA,) aor.
اَحَنَ,
(Msb, K,) inf. n. أَحَنٌ, (Msb,) or أَحْنٌ, and إِحْنَةٌ,
(TA,) or this last is a simple subst.; (Msb;) and
أَحَنَ عَلَيْهِ, aor.
اَحَنَ, inf. n. أَحْنٌ; (Kr, TA;) He
retained enmity against him in his bosom, watching
for an opportunity to indulge it, or exercise it;
or hid enmity against him in his bosom; or bore
rancour, malevolence, malice, or spite, against
him: (S, Msb, K: *) and he was affected with
anger (K, TA) against him, such as came upon
him suddenly from the retention or hiding of
enmity in the bosom, or from rancour, malevolence, malice, or spite. (TA.)

آحَنَهُ, (TA,) inf. n. مُؤَاحَنَةٌ, (S, K,) He
treated him, or regarded him, with enmity, or
hostility. (S, * K, * TA.)
إِحْنَةٌ Retention of enmity in the bosom, with
watchfulness for an opportunity to indulge it,
or exercise it; or concealment of enmity in the
bosom; or rancour, malevolence, malice, or spite:
(S, Msb, K:) and anger (K, TA) coming upon
one suddenly therefrom: (TA:) pl. إِحَنٌ. (S,
Msb, K.) It is said in the S that one should
not say حِنَةٌ; and this is disallowed by As and
Fr and Ibn-El-Faraj: in the T it is said that it is
not of the language of the Arabs; and As is
related to have disapproved of Et-Tirimmáh for
using its pl. in poetry: but it is said in a trad.,
مَا بَيْنِى وبَيْنَ العَرَبِ حِنَةٌ [There is not between
me and the Arabs retention of enmity in the
bosom, &c.]; and it occurs in another trad., in
a similar phrase; and the pl., in a third trad.;
therefore we say that it is a dial. var. of rare
occurrence. (TA.)
