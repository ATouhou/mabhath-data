أَبَّ, (T, S, M, &c.,) aor.
اَبِ3َ, (M, K,) agreeably with analogy in the case of an intrans. verb
of this class, (TA,) and
اَبُ3َ, (AZ, T, S, M, K,)
contr. to analogy, (TA,) inf. n. أَبٌّ (T, S, M, K)
and أَبِيبٌ (M, K) and أَبَابٌ and أَبَابَةٌ (S, M, K)
and إِبَابَةٌ; (M;) and ↓ ائْتَبَّ [written with the disjunctive alif اِيتَبَّ]; (T, K;) He prepared himself, (AZ, S, M, A, K,) and equipped himself,
(AZ, S, A,) for (لِ) departing, or going away,
(AZ, S,) or for journeying: (M, A, K:) or he
determined upon journeying, and prepared himself. (T.) El-Aashà says,
صَرَمْتُ وَلَمْ أَصْرِمْكُمُ وَكَصَارِمٍ
أَخٌ قَدْ طَوَى كَشْحًا وَأَبَّ لِيَذْهَبَا
(T, S, M, TA,) i. e. I cut [in effect, while I did
not really cut]  you: for like one who cuts is a
brother who has determined and prepared to go
away. (TA.) [Hence,] لَا عَبَابَ وَ لَا أَبَابَ, [or
لا عَبَابِ ولا أَبَابِ,] a prov. [which see explained in
art. عب]. (TA.) [And hence the saying,] هُوَ فِى
أَبَابِهِ, (S, M, K,) and أَبَابَتِهِ, and إِبَابَتِهِ, (M,) He
is in his [state of, or he is engaged in his,] preparation or equipment [for departing or journeying]. (S, M, K.) The hemzeh in أَبَّ is sometimes
changed into و; and thus وَبَّ, inf. n. وَبٌّ, signifies He prepared himself to assault, or charge, in
battle. (T, TA.) ―
-b2-  أَبَّتْ أَبَابَتُهُ, and إِبَابَتُهُ, His
way, or course, of acting, or conduct, or the like,
was, or became, rightly directed, or ordered. (M,
K.) ―
-b3-  ↓ أَبَّ أَبَّهُ i. q. قَصَدَ قَصْدَهُ, (K,) which signifies He tended, repaired, betook himself, or directed his course, towards him, or it: (S and Msb
in art. قصد:) and also, he pursued his (another‘s)
course, doing as he (the latter) did. (L in art.
وكد.) ―
-b4-  أَبَّدِ إِلَى وَطَنِهِ, (M, K,) aor.

not sown by men: (Msb:) it is, to cattle and
other beasts, what fruit is to men: (Mujáhid,
T, Msb:) or whatever grows upon the face of
the earth; (Atà, Th, T, M;) whatever vegetable the earth produces: (K, * TA:) and also,
green herbage, or plants: (K, * TA:) and, as
some say, straw, (Jel in lxxx. 31, and TA,) because cattle eat it: (TA:) or herbage prepared
for pasture and for cutting: (TA:) accord. to
IF, (Msb,) dried fruits; because prepared for
winter (Bd in lxxx. 31, and Msb) and for journeying: (Msb:) pl. [of pauc.] أَوُبٌّ, originally
أَأْبُبٌ. (I' Ak p. 367.) You say, فُلَانٌ رَاعَ لَهُ الحَبُّ
وَطَاعَ لَهُ الأَبُّ, meaning Such a one's seed-produce
[or grain] increased, and his pasture became
ample. (A.)
-A2-  Also a dial. var. of أَبٌ, A father.

إِبَّانٌ The time, or season, of a thing: (Msb:)
or the time of preparing, or making ready, of
a thing: (Mgh:) as, for instance, of fruit: (Mgh,
Msb:) it is of the measure فِعْلَانٌ, (Mgh, Msb,)
from أَبَّ in the first of the senses assigned to it
above, (Mgh,) the ن being augmentative; (Msb;)
or of the measure فِعَّالٌ, (Mgh, Msb,) from أَبَّنَ
“he watched” or “observed” a thing, (Mgh,)
the ن being radical: (Msb:) but the former
derivation is the more correct. (Mgh.) [See also
art. ابن.]
