أَنَّ, aor. يَئِنُّ, inf. n. أَنِينٌ and أُنَانٌ (S, M,
Msb, K) and تَأْنَانٌ (S, K) and أَنٌّ, (M, K,) He
moaned; or uttered a moan, or moaning, or prolonged voice of complaint; or said, Ah! syn.
تَأَوَّهَ; (M, K;) by reason of pain: (S, TA:) he
complained by reason of disease or pain: (TA:)
he uttered a cry or cries: (Msb:) said of a man.
(S, Msb.) ―
-b2-  أَنِّتِ القَوْسُ, aor. تَئِنُّ, inf. n. أَنِينٌ,
The bow made a gentle and prolonged sound.
(AHn, M.)
-A2-  لَا أَفْعَلُهُ مَا أَنَّ فِى السَّمَآءِ نَجْمٌ
means I will not do it as long as there is a star
in the heaven: (S, M, K:) أَنَّ being here a dial.
var. of عَنَّ. (S.) You say also, مَا أَنَّ فِي الفُرَاتِ
قَطْرَةٌ As long as there is a drop in the Euphrates.
(T, S.) And لَا أَفْعَلُهُ مَا أَنَّ فِى السَّمَآءٌ [I will
not do it as long as there is rain in the heaven].
(S.) [It is said in the M that Lh mentions the
last two sayings; but it is there indicated that he
read قَطْرَةً and سَمَآءً: and] ISk mentions the saying,
لَا أَفْعَلُهُ مَا أَنَّ فِى السَّمَآءِ نَجْمًا, (T, M,) and مَا عَنَّ
فِى السَّمَآءِ نَجْمٌ; (T;) [in the former of which,
أَنّ must be a particle (which see below); but it
seems that it should rather be إِنَّ, in this case, as
ISd thinks; for he says,] I know not for what
reason انّ is here with fet-h, unless a verb be
understood before it, as ثَبَتَ or وُجِدَ: [and he
adds,] Lh mentions مَا أَنَّ ذلِكَ الجَبَلَ مَكَانَهُ [as
long as that mountain is in its place]: and مَا أَنَّ
حِرَآءً مَكَانَهُ [as long as Mount Hirà is in its place]:
but he does not explain these sayings. (M.)
أَنٌ is a pronoun, denoting the speaker, [I, masc.
and fem.,] in the language of some of the Arabs:
they say, أَنْ فَعَلْتُ [I did], with the ن quiescent:
but most of them pronounce it [↓ أَنَ] with fet-h
when conjoined with a following word; (Mughnee, K;) saying, أَنَ فَعَلْتُ: (TA:) and [↓ أَنَا]
with ا in a case of pause: (Mughnee, K:) and
some pronounce it with ا also when it is conjoined
with a following word; saying, أَنَا فَعَلْتُ; [as we
generally find it written in books;] but this is of
a bad dialect: (TA:) [this last assertion, however,
requires consideration; for the dial. here said to
be bad is that of Temeem, accord. to what here
follows:] the Basrees hold that the pronoun consists of the ء and the ن, and that the [final] ا is
redundant, because it is suppressed in a case of
conjunction with a following word; but the
Koofees hold that the pronoun is composed of all
the three letters, because the ا is preserved in a
case of conjunction with a following word in the
dial. of Temeem. (Marginal note in a copy of
the Mughnee.) [Accord. to Az,] it is best to say
↓ أَنَا in a case of pause; and ↓ أَنَ in a case of
conjunction with a following word, as in أَنَ فَعَلْتُ
ذَاكَ [I did that]; but some of the Arabs say,
فَعَلْتُ ذَاكَ ↓ أَنَا; and some make the ن quiescent
in a case of this kind, though this is rare, saying,
أَنْ قُلْتُ ذَاكَ [I said that]; and Kudá'ah prolong
the former ا, saying, قُلْتُهُ ↓ آنَ. (T.) [Accord. to
J,] ↓ أَنَا is a pronoun denoting the speaker alone,
and is made to end invariably with fet-h to distinguish it from the particle أَنْ which renders the
aor. mansoob; the final ا being for the purpose of
showing what is the vowel in a case of pause; but
when it occurs in the middle [or beginning] of a
sentence, it is dropped, except in a bad dialect.
(S.) [Accord. to ISd,] ↓ أَنَ is a noun denoting
the speaker; and in a case of pause, you add ا at
the end, [saying ↓ أَنَا,] to denote quiescence; (M;)
[or] it is better to do this, though it is not always
done: (TA:) but it is said, on the authority of
Ktr, that there are five dial. vars. of this word;
namely, فَعَلْتُ ↓ أَنَ, and ↓ أَنَا, and ↓ آنَ, and أَنٌ,
and ↓ أَنَهٌ, all mentioned by IJ; but there is some
weakness in this: IJ says that the ه in ↓ أَنَهٌ may
be a substitute for the ا in أَنَا, because the latter
is the more usual, and the former is rare;
or it may be added to show what is the vowel,
like the ه, and be like the ه in كِتَابِيَهْ and
حِسَابِيَهٌ. (M.) For the dual, as well as the pl.,
only نَحْنُ is used. (Az, TA.) ―
-b2-  It is also a
pronoun denoting the person addressed, or spoken
to, by assuming the form ↓ أَنْتَ [Thou, masc.];
ت being added to it as the sign of the person
addressed, (S, M, Mughnee, K,) and أَنْ being
the pronoun, (M, Mughnee, K,) accord. to the
general opinion; (Mughnee, K;) the two becoming as one; not that one is prefixed to the
other as governing it in the gen. case: (S:) and
so ↓ أَنْتِ, (S, M, Mughnee, K,) addressed to the
female: (S, M:) and ↓ أَنْتُمَا, (M, Mughnee, K,)
addressed to two; not a regular dual, for were it
so it would be أَنْتَان; but like كُمَا in ضَرَبْتُكُمَا:
(M:) and ↓ أَنْتُمٌ and ↓ أَنْتُنَّ, (S, Mughnee, K,)
which are [respectively] the masc. and fem. pls.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  To each of these the ك of comparison is
sometimes prefixed; so that you say, ↓ أَنْتَ كَأَنَا
[Thou art like me, or as I], and ↓ أَنَا كَأَنْتَ [or
أَنَ كَأَنْتَ I am like thee, or as thou]; as is
related on the authority of the Arabs; for though
the ك of comparison is not prefixed to the [affixed]
pronoun, and you say, أَنْتَ كَزَيْدٍ but not أَنْتَ كِي,
yet the separate pronoun is regarded by them as
being in the same predicament as the noun; and
therefore the prefixing it to the latter kind of
pronoun is approved. (S.) It is said in the Book
of لَيْسَ, by IKh, that there is no such phrase, in
the language of the Arabs, as أَنْتَ كِى, nor as
أَنَا كَكَ, except in two forged verses; wherefore
Sb says that the Arabs, by saying أَنْتَ مِثْلِى and
أَنَا مثْلُكَ, have no need of saying أَنْتَ كِى and
أَنَا كَكَ: and the two verses are these:
وَلَوْلَا البَلَآءُ لَكَانُوا كَنَا  فَلَوْلَا الحَيَآإُ لَكُنَّا كَهُمٌ
[And but for the sense of shame, we had been like
them, or as they: and but for trial, or affliction,
they had been like us, or as we]: and
إِنْ تَكُنْ كِى فِإِنَّنِي كَكَ فِيهَا
إِنَّنَا فِى المَلَامِ مُصْطَحِبَانِ
[If thou art like me, or as I, verily I am like
thee, or as thou, in respect of her, or it, or them:
verily we, in respect of blame, are companions].
(TA.) Az mentions his having heard some of the
Benoo-Suleym say, كَمَا أَنْتَنِي, [the latter word
being a compound of the pronoun أَنْتَ, regularly
written separately, and the affixed pronoun نِى,]
meaning Wait thou for me in thy place. (TA.)
-A2-  It is also a particle: and as such, it is—First,
a particle of the kind called مَصْدَرِىٌّ, rendering
the aor. mansoob: (Mughnee, K:) i. e., (TA,)
it combines with a verb [in this case] in the future
[or aor.] tense, following it, to form an equivalent
to an inf. n., and renders it mansoob: (S, TA:)
you say, أُرِيدُ أَنْ تَقُومَ [I desire that thou stand,
or that thou wouldst stand, or that thou mayest
stand]; meaning أُرِيدُ قِيَامَكَ [I desire thy standing]. (S.) It occurs in two places: first, in that
of the inchoative, or in the beginning of a phrase,
so that it is in the place of a nom. case; as in the
saying [in the Kur ii. 180], وَأَنْ تَصُومُوا خَيْرٌ لَكُمْ
[And that ye fast is better for you]; (Mughnee,
K;) i. e. صِيَامُكُمْ [your fasting]. (TA.) And,
secondly, after a word denoting a meaning which
is not that of certainty: and thus it is the place
of a nom. case; as in the saying [in the Kur
lvii. 15], أَلَمْ يَأَنِ لِلَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَنٌ تَخْشَعَ قُلُوبُهُمْ
[Hath not the time that their hearts should become submissive, i. e. the time of their hearts'
becoming submissive, yet come unto those who have
believed?]: and in the place of an accus. case; as
in the saying [in the Kur x. 38], وَمَا كَانَ هذَا
القْرْآنُ أَنْ يُفْتَرَء [And this Kur-án is not such
that it might be forged; i. e., افُتِرِآءٌ; so in Bd
and Jel; and so in a marginal note to a copy of
the Mughnee, where is added, meaning مُفْتَرًى
forged]: and in the place of a gen. case; as in
the saying [in the Kur lxiii. 10], مِنْ قَبْلِ أَنْ يَأْتِىَ
أَحَدَكُمُ الْمَوْتُ [Before that death come unto any
one of you; i. e. before death's coming unto any
one of you]. (Mughnee, K.) Sometimes it makes
the aor. to be of the mejzoom form, (Mughnee,
K,) as some of the Koofees and AO have mentioned, and as Lh has stated on the authority of
certain of the Benoo-Sabbáh of Dabbeh; (Mughnee;) as in this verse:
إِذَا مَا غَدَوْنَا قَالَ وِلْدَانُ أَهْلِنَا
تَعَالوْغا إِلَى أَنْ يَأْتِنَا الصَّيْدُ نَحْطِبِ
[When we went away in the morning, the youths
of our family, or people, said, Come ye, until that
the chase come to us, (i. e. until the coming of the
chase to us,) let us collect firewood]. (Mughnee,
K.) And sometimes it is followed by an aor. of
the marfooa form; as in the saying [in the Kur
ii. 233], accord. to the reading of Ibn-Moheysin,
لِمَنْ أَرَادَ أَنْ يُتِمُّ الرَّضَاعَةَ [For him who desireth
that he may complete the time of sucking; i. e. the
completing thereof]; (Mughnee, K;) but this is
anomalous, (I 'Ak p. 101, and TA,) or أَنْ is here
a contraction of أَنَّ [for أَنَّهُ]: (I 'Ak:) and in the
saying of the poet,
أَنْ تَقَرَآنِ عَلَي أَسْمَآءِ وَيْحَكُمَا
مِنِّى السَّلَامَ وَأَنْ لَا تُخْبِرَا أَحَدَا
[That ye two convey, or communicate, to Asmà,
(mercy on you! or woe to you!) from me, salutation, and that ye inform not any one]; but the
Koofees assert that أَنٌ is here [in the beginning
of the verse] a contraction of أَنَّ, and anomalously
conjoined with the verb; whereas the Basrees
correctly say that it is أَنٌ which renders the aor.
mansoob, but is deprived of government by its
being made to accord with its co-ordinate مَا,
termed مَصْدَرِيَّة; (Mughnee;) or, as IJ says, on
the authority of Aboo-'Alee, أَنٌ is here used by
poetic licence for أَنَّكُمَا; and the opinion of the
Baghdádees [and Basrees], that it is likened to
مَا, and therefore without government, is improbable, because أَنْ is not conjoined with a verb in
the present tense, but only with the preterite and
the future. (M.) When it is suppressed, the aor.
may be either mansoob or marfooa; but the latter
is the better; as in the saying in the Kur
[xxxix. 64], أَفَغَيْرَ اللّٰهِ تَأْمُرُونِّى أَعْبُدُ [Other than
God do ye bid me worship?]. (S.) If it occurs
immediately before a preterite, it combines with
it to form an equivalent to an inf. n. relating to
past time; being in this case without government:
you say, أَعْجَيَنِيأَنْ قُمْتَ [It pleased me that
thou stoodest]; meaning thy standing that is past
pleased me: (S:) and thus it is used in the saying
[in the Kur xxviii. 82], لَوْلَا أَنٌ مَنَّ اللّٰهُ عَلَيْنَا
[Were it not for that God conferred favour upon
us; i. e., for God's having conferred favour upon
us]. (Mughnee.) It is also conjoined with an
imperative; as in the phrase mentioned by Sb,
كَتَبْتُ إِلَيهِ بِأَنة قُمٌ [I wrote to him, Stand; i. e.
I wrote to him the command to stand]; which
shows that AHei is wrong in asserting that whenever it is conjoined with an imperative it is an
explicative [in the sense of أَيٌ], and that in this
particular instance the ب may be redundant,
which it cannot here be, because, whether redundant or not, it is not put immediately before
anything but a noun or what may be rendered by
a noun. (Mughnee.) ―
-b2-  Secondly, it is a con-
traction of أَنَّ; (Mughnee, K;) and occurs after
a verb denoting certainty, or one used in a manner
similar to that of such a verb: (Mughnee:) so in
the saying [in the Kur lxxiii. 20], عَلِمَ أَنٌ سَيَكُونُ
مِنْكُمٌ مَرْضَي [He knoweth that (the case will be
this:) there will be among you some diseased; the
affixed pronoun هُ, meaning اشَّأْنَ, being understood after أَنْ, which therefore stands for أَنَّهُ, i. e.
أَنَّ الشَّأْنَ]: (Mughnee, K: *) and in the phrase,
بَلَغَنِى أَنْ قَدْ كَانَ كَذَا وكَذَا [It has come to my
knowledge, or been related to me, or been told to
me, or it came to my knowledge, &c., that (the
case is this:) such and such things have been]; a
phrase of this kind, in which أَنْ occurs with a
verb, not being approved without قَدْ, unless you
say, بَلَغَنِى أَنَّهُ كَانَ كَذَا وَكَذَا: (Lth, T:) [for]
when the contracted أَنْ has for its predicate a
verbal proposition, of which the verb is neither
imperfectly inflected, like لَيْسَ and عَسَى, nor
expressive of a prayer or an imprecation, it is
separated from the verb, according to the more
approved usage, by قَدْ, or the prefix سَ, or سَوْفَ,
or a negative, as لَا &c., or لَوْ: (I 'Ak pp. 100
and 101:) but when its predicate is a nominal
proposition, it requires not a separation; so that
you say, CCC عَلِمْتُ أَنْ زِيْدٌ قَائِمٌ [I knew that (the
case was this:) Zeyd was standing]; (I 'Ak p. 100;)
and بَلَغَنِى أَنْ زَيدٌ خَارِجٌ [It has come to my
knowledge, or been related to me, or been told to
me, &c., that (the case is this:) Zeyd is going, or
coming, out, or forth]; (TA;) except in the case
of a negation, as in the saying in the Kur [xi. 17],
وأَنْ لَا إِلهَ إِلَّا هُوَ [And that (the case is this:)
there is no deity but He]. (I 'Ak p. 100.) Thus
used, it is originally triliteral, and is also what is
termed مَصْدَرِيَّة; [عَلِمَ أَنْ, in the first of the exs.
above, for instance, meaning عَلِمَ أَنَّهُ, i. e. عَلِمَ أَنَّ
الشَّأْنَ, which is equivalent to عَلِمَ كَوْنَ الشَّأْنِ;]
and governs the subject in the accus. case, and
the predicate in the nom. case: and its subject
must be a pronoun, suppressed, [as in the exs.
given above, where it means الشَّأْنِ, and in a verse
cited before, commencing أَنْ تَقْرَآنِ, accord. to
A'boo-'Alee,] or expressed; the latter, accord. to
the more correct opinion, being allowable only by
poetic license: and its predicate must be a proposition, unless the subject is expressed, in which
case it may be either a single word or a proposition; both of which kinds occur in the following
saying [of a poet]:
بِأَنْكَ رَبِيعٌ وغَيْثٌ مَرِيعٌ
وَأَنْكَ هُنَاكَ تَكُونَ الثِّمَالَا
[he is speaking of persons coming as guests to
him whom he addresses, when their provisions
are exhausted, and the horizon is dust-coloured,
and the north wind is blowing, (as is shown by
the citation of the verse immediately preceding,
in the T,) and he says, They know that thou art
like rain that produces spring-herbage, and like
plenteous rain, and that thou, there, art the aider
and the manager of the affairs of people]. (Mughnee. [In the T, for رَبِيعٌ, I find الَّربِيعُ; and for
وَأَنْكَ, I there find وَقِدْمًا: but the reading in the
Mughnee is that which is the more known.])
[J says,] أَنْ is sometimes a contraction of أَنَّ
and does not govern [anything]: you say, بَلَغَنِى
أَنٌ زَيْدٌ خَارِجٌ [explained above]; and it is said
in the Kur [vii. 41], وَنُودُوا أَنْ تِلْكُمُ الجَنَّةُ [And
it shall be proclaimed to them that (the case is
this:) that is Paradise]: (S:) [here, however,
أَنة is regarded by some as an explicative, as will
be seen below:] but in saying this, J means
that it does not govern as to the letter; for
virtually it does govern; its subject being meant
to be understood; the virtual meaning being
أَنَّهُ تِلْكُمُ الجَنَّةُ. (IB.) [In another place, J says,]
You may make the contracted أَنْ to govern or
not, as you please. (S.) Aboo-Tálib the Grammarian mentions an assertion that the Arabs
make it to govern; as in the saying [of a poet,
describing a beautiful bosom],
كَأَنْ ثَذْيَيْهِ حُقَّانِ
[As though its two breasts were two small round
boxes]: but [the reading commonly known is
كَأَنْ ثَدْيَاهُ حُقَّانِ
(this latter reading is given in De Sacy's Anthol.
Gram. Ar. p. 104 of the Ar. text; and both are
given in the S;) كَأَنْ here meaning كَأَنَّهُ; and]
Fr says, We have not heard the Arabs use the
contracted form and make it to govern except
with a pronoun, in which case the desinential
syntax is not apparent. (T.) The author of the
K says in the B that you say, عَلِمْتُ أَنْ زيْدًا
لَمُنْطَلِقٌ [I knew that Zeyd was indeed going
away], with ل when it is made to govern; and
عَلِمْتُ أَنْ زَيْدٌ مُنْطَلِقٌ [I knew that (the case was
this:) Zeyd was going away], without ل when it
is made to have no government. (TA. [But in the
latter ex. it governs the subject, which is understood, as in other exs. before given.]) [See an ex.
in a verse ending with the phrase وَكَأَنْ قَدِ cited
voce قَد, where كَأَنْ is for كَأَنَّهُ, meaning كَأَنَّ
الشّأنَ, and a verb is understood after قد. And
see also أَنَّ, below.]―
-b2- Thirdly, it is an explicative, (Mughnee, K,) meaning أَيْ (S, M, and
so in some copies of the K,) or [rather] used
in the manner of أَيْ; (Mughnee, and so in some
copies of the K;) [meaning قَائِلًا, or قَائِلِينَ;
or يَقُولُ, or يَقُولُونَ; or some other form of the
verb قَالَ; i. e. Saying ; &c.;] as in the saying
[in the Kur xxiii. 27], فَأَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْهِ أَنِ اصْنَعِ الْقُلْكَ
[And we revealed, or spake by revelation, unto
him, saying, Make thou the ark]; (Mughnee,
K) and [in the Kur vii. 41,]وَنُودُوا أَنْ تِلْكُمُ
الْجَنَّةُ [And it shall be proclaimed to them, being
said, That is Paradise]; or in these two instances
it may be regarded as what is termed مَصْدَرِيَّة,
by supposing the preposition [بِ] understood
before it, so that in the former instance it is the
biliteral, because it is put before the imperative,
and in the second it is the contraction of أَنَّ
because it is put before a nominal proposition;
(Mughnee;) and [in the Kur xxxviii. 5,] وَانْطَلَقَ
الْمَلَأُ مِنْهُمْ أَنِ امْشُوا(S, M, Mughnee) i. e. [And
the chief persons of them] broke forth, or launched
forth, with their tongues, or in speech, [saying,]
Go ye on, or continue ye, in your course of action
&c. (Mughnee.) For this usage of أَنْ certain
conditions are requisite : first, that it be preceded
by a proposition : secondly, that it be followed
by a proposition; so that you may not say, ذَكَرْتُ
عَسْجَدًا أَنْ ذَهَبًا, but you must say أَىٌ in this
case, or must omit the explicative : thirdly, that
the preceding proposition convey the meaning of
القَوْلُ, as in the exs. above; in the last of which,
انطلق has the meaning assigned to it above; not
that of walking or going away : fourthly, that there
be not in the preceding proposition the letters of
القَوْلُ; so that one may not say, قُلْتُ لَهُ أَنِ افْعَلْ;
or, if there be in it those letters, that the word
which they compose shall be interpreted by
another word; as in the saying, in the Kur
[v, 117], مَا قُلْتُ لَهُمْ إِلَّا مَا أَمَرْتَنِى بِهِ أَنِ اعْبُدُوا اللّٰهَ
which may mean, as Z says,  I have not commanded them [aught save that which Thou commandedst me, saying, Worship ye God]; (Mughnee;) in which instance Fr says that it is an
explicative : (T :) fifthly, that there be not a preposition immediately before it; for if you say,
كَتَبْتُ إِلَيْهِ بِأَنِ افْعَلْ كَذَا, it is what is termed
مَصْدَرِيَّة [as we have before shown]. (Mughnee.)
When it may be regarded as an explicative and
is followed by an aor. with لا as in أَشَرْتُ إِلَيْهِ أَنْ
لَا تَفْعَل كَذَا, it may be marfooa, [namely, the
aor.,] on the supposition that لا is a negative ;
or mejzoom, on the supposition that it is a prohibitive; and in both cases ان is an explicative ;
[so that the meaning is, I made a sign to him,
as though saying, Thou wilt not do such a thing,
in the former case ; or, in the latter, Do not thou
such a thing ;] or mansoob, on the supposition
that لا is a negative and that ان is what is termed
مَصْدَرِيَّة: but if لا is wanting, it may not be
mejzoom, but may be marfooa [if we use ان as
an explicative] or mansoob [if ان be what is
termed مَصْدَرِيَّة]. (Mughnee.)―
-b3-  Fourthly, it is
redundant, as a corroborative, (Mughnee, K,)
like whatever else is redundant : and thus it is
in four cases : one of these, which is the most
common, being when it occurs after لَمَّا denoting
time; [and this is mentioned in the M ; ] as in
the saying [in the Kur xxix. 32], وَلمَّا أَنْ جَآءَ تْ
رُسُلُنَا لُوطًا [And when our apostles came to Lot]:
(Mughnee:) [or,] accord. to J, (TA,) it is sometimes a connective to لَمَّا; as in the saying in the
Kur [xii. 96], فَلَمَّا أَنْ جَآءَ الْبَشِيرُ [And when that
(like as we say, " now that,") the announcer of
good tidings came] : and sometimes it is redundant ; as in the saying in the Kur [viii. 34],
وَمَا لَهُمْ أَنْ لَا يُعَذِبَهُمُ اللّٰهُ [as though it might
be rendered But what reason have they, God
should not punish them?] : (S, TA:) but IB
says that the connective is redundant ; and [that
ان is not redundant in the latter instance, for]
if it were redundant in this verse of the Kur it
would not render the [aor.] verb mansoob. (TA.
[The author of the Mughnee, like IB, disallows
that ان is redundant in a case of this kind, which
Kh asserts it to be ; and says that فِى is under-
stood before it.]) The second case is when it
occurs between لَوٌ and a verb signifying swearing,
the latter being expressed; as in this verse:
فَأُقْسِمُ أَنْ لَوِ الْتَقَيْنَا وَأَنْتُمُ
لَكَانَ لَنَا يَوْمٌ مِنَ الشَّرِّ مُظْلِمُ
[And I swear, had we and you met, there had
been to us a dark day of evil]: and when that
verb is omitted; as in the following ex.:
أَمَا وَاللّٰهِ أَنْ لَوْ كُنْتَ حُرِّا
وَمَا بِالْحُِرِأَنْتَ وَلَا العَتِيقِ
[Verily, or now surely, by God, if thou wert
freeborn; but thou art not the freeborn nor the
emancipated]: so say Sb and others: Ibn-'Os-
foor holds it to be a particle employed to connect
the complement of the oath with the oath; but
this is rendered improbable by the fact that it
is in most cases omitted, and such particles are
not. (Mughnee.) The third case, which is extr.,
is when it occurs between the ك [of comparison]
and the noun governed by it in the genitive case;
as in the saying,
وَيَوْمًا تُوَافِينَا بِوَجْهٍ مُقَسَّمٍ
كَأَنٌ ظَبْيَةٍ تَعْطُو إِلَى وَارِقِ السَّلَمْ
[And on a day thou comest to us with a beautiful face, like a doe-gazelle raising her head
towards the goodly green-leaved tree of the selem
kind], accord. to the reading of him who makes
طبيةْ to be governed in the genitive case [instead
of the accus. or the nom.; for if we read it in
the accus. or the nom., أَنْ is a contraction of أَنَّ;
in the former case, ظبية being its subject, and its
predicate being suppressed; and in the latter case,
the meaning being كَأَنَّهَا ظَبْيَةٌ, so that the subject
of ان is suppressed]. (Mughnee.) The fourth
case is when it occurs after إِذَا; as in the following ex.:
فَأُمْهلُهُ حَتَّى إذَا أَنْ كَأَنَّهُ
مُعَاطِى يَدٍ فِي لُجَّةِ المَآءِ غَامِرُ
[And I leave him alone until when he is as though
he were a giver of a hand to be laid hold upon,
in the fathomless deep of the water immerged].
(Mughnee.) ―
-b4-  [Fifthly,] among other meanings
which have been assigned to it, (Mughnee,) it
has a conditional meaning, like إِنٌ: (Mughnee,
K:) so the Koofees hold; and it seems to be
most probably correct, for several reasons: first,
because both these forms occur, accord. to different readings, in several instances, in one
passage of the Kur; as in [ii. 282,] أَنْ تَضِلٌّ
إِحْدَاهُمَا [If one of them twain (namely, women,)
err]; &c.: secondly, because [the prefix] فَ
often occurs after it; as in a verse commencing
with أَبَا خُرَاشَةَ [as cited voce أَمَّا, accord. to some
who hold that أمَّا in that verse is a compound
of the conditional أَنْ and the redundant مَا; and
as in the Kur ii. 282, where the words quoted
above are immediately followed by فَتُذَكِّرَ إِحْدَاهُمَا
الْأُخْرَى]: thirdly, because it is conjoined with
إِنٌ [which forms a part of the compound إِكَّا]
in this ex.:
إِمَّا أَقَمْتَ وَأَمَّا أَنْتَ مُرْتَحِلًا
فَاللّٰهُ يَكْلَأُ مَا تَأْتِى وَمَا تَذَرُ
[If thou remain, and if thou be going away (أَمَّا
meaning أَنْ كُنْتَ, as syn. with إِنْ كُنْتَ), may
God guard thee (يَكْلَأُ being marfooa because of
the ف) as long as thou doest and as long as thou
leavest undone]: thus related, with kesr to the
former ان [in إِنَّا] and with fet-h to the latter
[in أَمَّا]. (Mughnee.) ―
-b5-  [Sixthly,] it is a negative, like إِنْ: (Mughnee, K:) so, as some say,
in [the Kur iii. 66,] أَنع يُؤْتَى أَحَدٌ مِثْلَ مَا أُوتِيتُمْ
[meaning accord. to them Not any one is given
the like of that scripture which ye have been
given]: but it is said [by others] that the meaning is, [taken with what precedes it,] And believe
not ye that (بِأَنْ) any one is given the like of
that scripture which ye have been given, except
it be given to him who followeth your religion;
and that the phrase “ say thou, Verily the direction is the direction of God,” is parenthetic.
(Mughnee.) ―
-b6-  [Seventhly,] it is syn. with إِذْ,
(AZ, T, Mughnee, K, [in Freytag's Lex., from
the K, إِذْ قِيلَ, but قيل in the K relates to what
there follows,]) as some say, in [the Kur l. 2,]
بَلْ عَجِبُوا أَنٌ جَآءَهُمْ مُنْذِرٌمِنْهُمْ [Verily they wonder
because a warner from among themselves hath
come unto them]; (Mughnee, K;) and in other
instances; but correctly, in all these instances,
ان is what is termed مَصْدَرِيَّة, and لِ denoting
cause is understood before it. (Mughnee.) [See
also أَمَّا and إِمَّا.] ―
-b7-  [Eighthly,] it is syn. with
لِئَلّا, accord. to some, in [the Kur iv. last verse,]
يُبَيِّنُ اللّٰهُأَنْ تَضِلُّوا [God explaineth to you
(the ordinances of your religion, Jel), lest ye
should err, or in order that ye may not err];
(Mughnee, K;) and in the saying,
نَزَلْتُمْ مَنْزِلَ الأَضْيَافِ مِنَّا
فَعَجَّلْنَا القِرَى أَنْ تَشْتِمُونَا
[Ye became, or have become, in the condition of
our guests; so we hastened, or have hastened,
the entertainment, lest ye should revile us, or in
order that ye should not revile us]: (Mughnee:)
but correctly, in such a case [likewise], ان is
what is termed مَصْدَرِيَّة, and the original wording
is كَرَاهَةَ أَنْ تَضِلُّوا [from a motive of dislike that
ye should err], (Mughnee, K,) and مَخَافَةَ أَنْ
تَشْتِمُونَا [from a motive of fear that ye should
revile us]: so say the Basrees: some say, extravagantly, that ل is meant to be understood before
it, and الَّذِى after it. (Mughnee.) ―
-b8-  [Ninthly,] it
occurs in the sense of الَّذِى; as in the saying,
زَيْدٌ أَعْقَلُ مِنٌ أَنْ يَكْذِب [Zeyd is more reasonable
than he who lies; which is equivalent to saying,
Zeyd is too reasonable to lie: but respecting its
usage in a phrase of this kind, and respecting the
form of the aor. after it in such a case, see مِنْ].
(Kull p. 78.) ―
-b9-  By a peculiarity of pronunciation
termed عَنْعَتَةٌ, the tribe of Temeem say عَنْ instead
of أَنٌ. (M.)
إِنٌ is used in various ways: first, as a conditional particle, (S, M, Msb, Mughnee, K,) denoting
the happening of the second of two events in consequence of the happening of the first, (S, Msb, *)
whether the second be immediate or deferred, and
whether the condition be affirmative or negative;
(Msb;) [and as such it is followed by a mejzoom
aor., or by a pret. having the signification of an
aor.;] as in the saying, [إِنْ تَفْعَلٌ أفْعَلٌ If thou
do such a thing, I will do it; and] إِنْ تَأْتِنِى آتِكَ
[If thou come to me, I will come to thee]; and
إِنٌ جِئْتَنِى أَكْرَمْتُكَ [If thou come to me, I will
treat thee with honour]; (S;) and إِنْ فَعَلْتَ فَعَلْتُ
[If thou do, I will do] for which the tribe of
Teiyi say, as IJ relates on the authority of Ktr,
هِنْ فَعَلْتَ فَعَلْتُ; (M;) and إِنْ دَخَلْت الدَّارَ أَوٌ [If
thou stand, I will stand]; and إِنْ دَخَلْتِ الدَّارَ أَوْ
لَمْ تَدْخُلِى الدَّارض فَأَنْتِ طَالقٌ [If thou enter the
house, or if thou enter not the house, thou shalt
be divorced]; (Msb;) and [in the Kur viii. 39,]
إِنْ يَنْتَهُوا يُغْفَرٌ لَهُمْ مَا قَد سَلَفَ [If they desist,
what hath already past shall be forgiven them];
and [in verse 19 of the same ch.,] وَإِنْ تَعُودُوا نَعُدْ
[But if ye return to attacking the Apostle, we
will return to assisting him]. (Mughnee, K.)
[On the difference between it and إِذا, see the
latter.] When either it or إِذَا is immediately
followed by a noun in the nom. case, the said
noun is governed in that case by a verb necessarily suppressed, of which it is the agent; as
in the saying, in the Kur [ix. 6], وَإِنْ أَحَدٌ مِنَ
الْمُشْرِكِينَ استَجَارَكَ; the complete phrase being وَإِنِ
اسْتَجَارَكَ أَحَدٌ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ اسْتَجَارَكَ [And if
any one of the believers in a plurality of gods
demand protection of thee, (if) he demand protection of thee]: so accord. to the generality of the
grammarians. (I 'Ak p. 123.) Sometimes it is
conjoined with the negative لَا, and the ignorant
may imagine it to be the exceptive إِلَّا; as in [the
saying in the Kur ix. 40,] إِلَّا تَنْصُرُوهُ فَقَد نَصَرَهُ اللّٰهُ
[If ye will not aid him, certainly God did
aid him]; and [in the next preceding verse,]
إِلَّا تَنْفِرُوا يُعَذِّبْكُمْ [If ye will not go forth to war,
He will punish you]. (Mughnee, K. *) It is
sometimes used to denote one's feigning himself
ignorant; as when you say to one who asks, “Is
thy child in the house? ” and thou hast knowledge
thereof, إِنْ كَانَ فِى الدَّارِ أَعْلَمْتُكَ بِهِ [If he be in
the house, I will inform thee thereof]. (Msb.)
And to denote one's putting the knowing in the
predicament of the ignorant, in order to incite to
the doing or continuing an action; as when you
say, إِنٌ كُنْتَ ابُنِى فَأَطِعْنِى [If thou be my son,
obey me]; as though you said, “Thou knowest
that thou art my son, and it is incumbent on the
son to obey the father, and thou art not obedient;
therefore do what thou art commanded to do. ”
(Msb.) And sometimes it is divested of the conditional meaning, and becomes syn. with لَو; as
in the saying, صَلِّ وَإِنٌ عَجَزْتَ عَنِ القِيَام [Pray
thou though thou be unable to stand;] i. e. pray
thou whether thou be able to stand or unable to
do so; and in the saying, أَكْرِمٌ زِيْدًا وَإِنْ قَعَدَ
i. e. [Treat thou Zeyd with honour] though he be
sitting; or, whether he sit or not. (Msb.) [إِمَّا
as a compound of the conditional إِنٌ and the
redundant مَا, see in an art. of which اما is the
heading.] ―
-b2-  [Secondly,] it is a negative, (S,
Mughnee, K,) syn. with مَا; (S;) and is put
before a nominal proposition; (Mughnee, K;) as
in the saying [in the Kur lxvii. 20], إِنِ الْكَافِرُونَ
إِلَّا فِى غُرُورٍ [The unbelievers are not in aught
save in a deception]; (S, Mughnee, K;) and
before a verbal proposition; as in [the Kur ix. 108,]
إِنْ أَرَدْنَا إِلَّا الْحُسْنَى [We desired not, or meant
not, aught save that which is best]. (Mughnee,
K.) The assertion of some, that the negative إِنٌ
does not occur except where it is followed by إِلَّا,
as in the instances cited above, or by لَمَّا, with tesh-deed, which is syn. therewith, as, accord. to a
reading of some of the Seven [Readers], in the
saying [in the Kur lxxxvi. 4], إِنْ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ لَمَّا
عَلَيْهَا حَافِظٌ, i. e., مَا كُلُّ نَفْسٍ إِلَّا عَلَيْهَا حَافِظٌ [There
is not any soul but over it is a guardian], is
refuted by the sayings in the Kur [x. 69 and
lxxii. 26], إِنْ عِندَكُمْ مِنْ سُلْطَانٍ بِهٰذَا [meaning,
accord. to the Jel., Ye have no proof of this that
ye say], and إِنْ أَدْرِيأَقَرِيبٌ مَا تُوعَدُونَ [I know
not whether that with which ye are threatened be
nigh]. (Mughnee, K. *) The conditional and the
negative both occur in the saying in the Kur
[xxxv. 39], وَلَئِنْ زَالَتَا إِنْ أَمْسَكَهُمَا مِنْ أَحَدٍ مِنْ بَعْدِهِ
[And I swear that, if they should quit their place,
not any one should withhold them after Him]:
the former is conditional; and the latter is negative, and is [part of] the complement of the oath
which is denoted by the ل prefixed to the former;
the complement of the condition being necessarily
suppressed. (Mughnee.) When it is put before
a nominal proposition, it has no government,
accord. to Sb and Fr; but Ks and Mbr allow its
governing in the manner of لَيْسَ; and Sa'eed
Ibn-Jubeyr reads, [in the Kur vii. 193,] إِنِ الَّذِينَ
تَدْعُونَ مِنْ دُونِ اللّٰهِ عِبَادًا أَمْثَالَكُمٌ [Those whom ye
invoke beside God, or others than God, are not
men like you]: also, the people of El-'Áliyeh
have been heard to say, إِنٌ أَحَدٌ خَيْرًامِنْ أَحدٍ إِلَّا
بِالعَافِيَةِ [Any one is not better than any other one,
except by means of health, or soundness]; and
إِنْ ذٰلِكَ نَافِعَكَ وَلَا ضَارَّكَ [That is not profitable to
thee nor injurious to thee]: as an ex. of its occurrence without government, which is mostly the
case, the saying of some, قَائمٌ ↓ إِنَّ may be
explained as originally إِنٌ أَنَا قَائِمٌ [I am not
standing]; the أ of أَنَا being elided for no reason
in itself, and the ن of إِنٌ being incorporated into
the ن of أَنَا, and the ا of this latter being elided
in its conjunction with the following word; but
إِنَّ قَائِمًا has also been heard. (Mughnee.) Sometimes it occurs [as a negative] in the complement
of an oath: you say, وَاللّٰهِ إِنٌ فَعَلْتُ, meaning
مَا فَعَلْتُ [By God, I did not]. (S.) ―
-b3-  [Thirdly,]
it is a contraction of إِنَّ, and is put before a
nominal and before a verbal proposition. (Mughnee, K.) In the former case, it is made to govern
and is made to have no government: (S, * K:)
[i. e.] in this case, it is allowable to make it
govern; contr. to the opinion of the Koofees:
(Mughnee:) Lth says that he who uses the contracted form of إِنَّ uses the nom. case with it,
except that some of the people of El-Hijáz use the
accus. case with it: (T:) thus it is said, accord.
to one reading, [in the Kur xi. 113,] إِنْ كُلَّا لَمَا
لَيُوَفِّيَنَّهُمٌ رَبُّكَ أَعْمَالَهُمٌ [Verily all of them, thy
Lord will indeed fully render them the recompense of their works]: (T, Mughnee:) Fr says,
We have not heard the Arabs use the contracted
form and make it to govern, unless with a pronoun,
in which case the desinential syntax is not apparent; and he adds that in the instance cited above,
they make كُلّا to be governed in the accus. case
by ليوفّينّهم; as though the phrase were لَيُوَفِّيَنَّهُمْ
كُلَّا; and that كُلُّ would be proper; for you
say, إِنْ زَيْدٌ لَقَائِمٌ [Verily Zeyd is standing]:
(T:) the ex. given by Sb is, إِنْ عَمْرًا لَمُنطَلِقٌ
[Verily 'Amr is going away]. (Mughnee.) But
it is [most] frequently made to have no government; as in the saying [in the Kur xliii. 34
accord. to one reading], وَإِنْ كُلُّ ذٰلِكَ لَمَا مَتَاعُ
الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا [And verily all that is the furniture
of the present life]; and, accord. to the reading
of Hafs, [and of 'Ásim and Kh, in the Kur xx. 66,
respecting which see إِنَّ,] إِنْ هٰذَانِ لَسَاحِرَانِ
[Verily these two are enchanters]; &c. (Mughnee.) When it is put before a verbal proposition,
it is necessarily made to have no government:
(Mughnee, K:) and in most cases the verb is a
preterite and of the kind called نَاسِخ [which
effects a change of the grammatical form or of the
meaning in a nominal proposition before which it
is placed]; as in the saying [in the Kur ii. 138],
وَإِنْ كَانَتٌ لَكَبِيرَةً [And verily it was a great
matter]; and [in the Kur xvii. 75,] وَإِنْ كَادُوا
لَيَفْتِنُونَكَ [And verily they were near to seducing
thee]; (Mughnee;) in which last ex. AZ says, it
means لَقَدْ, i. e. without doubt; and so in the
same ch. vv. 78 and 108: (T:) less frequently it
is an aor. of a verb of this kind; as in the saying
[in the Kur xxvi. 186], وَإِنْ نَظُنُّكَ لَمِنَ الْكَاذِبينَ
[And verily we think thee to be of the number of
the liars]: and both these kinds of expression
may be taken as exs. to be imitated: less frequently than this it is a preterite of a verb not
of the kind termed نَسخ; as in the saying [of a
poet],
شَلَّتٌ يَمِينُكَ إِنٌ قَتَلْتَ لَمُسْلِمًا
[May thy right arm, or hand, dry up, or become
unsound! verily thou hast slain a Muslim]; but
this may not be taken as an ex. to be imitated; contr.
to the opinion of Akh; for he allows the phrase,
إِنْ قِامَ لَأَنَا [Verily I stood], and إِنٌ قَعَدَ لأَنْتَ
[Verily thou sattest]: and less frequently than
this it is an aor. of a verb not of the kind termed
ناسخ; as in the saying, إِنْ يَزِينُكَ لَنَفْسُكَ وَإِنٌ
يَشِينُكَ لَهِيَهٌ [Verily thy soul is that which beautifies
thee, and it is that which deforms thee]; and this,
by common consent, may not be taken as an ex.
to be imitated. (Mughnee.) Wherever you find
إِنٌ with لَ after it, decide that it is originally إِنَّ;
(Mughnee, K;) as in the exs. above: but respecting
this ل there is a difference of opinion: see this
letter. (Mughnee.) J says, (TA,) إِنٌ is sometimes a contraction of إِنَّ, and this must have ل
put before its predicate, to compensate for what is
elided, of the doubled letter; as in the saying in
the Kur [lxxxvi. 4, accord. to him who reads لَمَا
instead of لَمَّا], إِنْ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ لَمَا عَلَيْهَا حَافِظٌ [Verily
every soul hath over it a guardian]; and in the
saying, إِنٌ زَيدٌ لَأَخُوكَ [Verily Zeyd is thy brother];
in order that it may not be confounded with إِنٌ
which is syn. with the negative مَا: (S, TA:) but
IB says, ل is here introduced to distinguish
between negation and affirmation, and this إِنْ has
neither subject nor predicate; so J's saying that
the ل is put before its predicate is without meaning: and this ل is sometimes introduced with the
objective complement of a verb; as in إِنْ ضَرَبْتُ
لَزَيْدًا [Verily I struck, or beat, Zeyd]; and with
the agent; as in إِنْ قَامَ لَزَيْدٌ [Verily Zeyd stood].
(TA.) When the contracted إِنْ governs, this ل
is not necessary; so you may say, إِنْ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ
[Verily Zeyd is standing]; because in this case
it cannot be confounded with the negative; for
the negative does not render the subject mansoob
and the predicate marfooa: and when it does not
govern, if the meaning is apparent, the ل is not
needed; as in
وَنَحْنُ أُبَاةُ الضَّيْمِ مِنْ آلِ مَالِكٍ
وَإِنْ مَالِكٌ كَانَتْ كِرَامَ المَعَادِنِ
[And we are persons who refuse to submit to
injury, of the family of Málik: and verily the
family of Málik are generous in respect of their
origins]; كَانَتْ being here for لَكَانَتٌ. (I 'Ak
p. 99.) ―
-b4-  [Fourthly,] it is redundant, (S, Mughnee, K,) occurring with مَا; as in the saying,
مَا إِنْ يَقُومُ زَيْدٌ [Zeyd does not stand]; (S;) and
in the saying [of a poet],
كَا إِنْ أَتَيْتَ بِشْىءٍ أَنْتَ تَكْرَهُهُ
[Thou didst not a thing which thou dislikest].
(Mughnee, K: in the CK اَتْتُ.) It is mostly
thus used after the negative ما, when put before a
verbal proposition; as above; or before a nominal
proposition; as in the saying,
مَنَايَانَا وَدَوْلَةُ آخَرِينَا  وَمَا إِنْ طِبُّنَا جبُنٌ ولٰكِنٌ
[And our habit is not cowardice; but our destinies
and the good fortune of others caused our being
defeated]: and in this case it prevents the government of ما, as in this verse: but in the saying,
بَنِى غُدَانَةَ مَا إِنْ أَنْتُمُ ذَهَبًا
وَلَا صَرِيفًا وَلٰكِنٌ أَنْتُمُ الخَزَفُ
[Sons of Ghudáneh, ye are not indeed gold, nor
silver, or pure silver, but ye are pottery], accord.
to him who relates it thus, saying ذهبًا and صريفًا,
in the accus. case, it is explained as a negative,
corroborative of ما: (Mughnee:) and accord. to J,
(TA,) the negatives مَا and إِنٌ are sometimes
thus combined for corroboration; as in the saying
of the rájiz, (El-Aghlab El-'Ijlee, TA,)
أَكْثَرَ مِنْهُ قِرَةً وَقَارَا  مَا إِنٌ رَأَيْنَا مَلِكَّا أَغَارَا
[We have not indeed seen a king who has made
a hostile incursion possessing more numerous
sheep, or goats, and camels, than he]; (S, TA;)
but IB says that ان is here redundant, not a
negative. (TA.) Sometimes it is redundant after
the conjunct noun مَا; as in the saying,
يُرَجِىّ المَرْإُ مَا إِنٌ لَا يَرَاهُ
وَتَعْرِضُ دُونَ أَدْنَاهُ الخُطُوبُ
[Man hopes for that which he will not see; for
calamities intervene as obstacles in the way to
what is nearest thereof]. (Mughnee.) And after
the مَا termed مَصْدَرِيَّة, (Mughnee,) [i. e.,] after
the adverbial مَا [which is of the kind termed
مصدريّة]; (TA;) as in the saying (of Maaloot
El-Kurey'ee, cited by Sb, TA),
وَرَجِّ الفَتَى لِلْخَيْرِ مَا إِنْ رَأَيْتَهُ
عَلَي السِّنِّ خَيْرًا لَايَزَالُ يَزِيدُ
[And hope thou that the youth is destined for
good as long as thou hast seen him not ceasing
to increase in good with age]. (Mughnee.) And
after the inceptive أَلَا; as in the saying,
أَلَا إِنْ سَرَى لَيْلِى فبِتُّ كَئِيبَا
أُحَاذِرُ أَنْ تَنْأَى النَّوَى بِغَضُوبَا
[Now he journeyed on, or during, that my night,
and I passed the night in an evil state, broken
in spirit by grief, being fearful that the distance
to which he was going with Ghadoob (a woman
so named) would become far]. (Mughnee.) And
before the meddeh denoting disapproval: [for]
Sb heard a man, on its being said to him, “Wilt
thou go forth if the desert become plentiful
in herbage? ” reply, أَأَنَا إِنِيهٌ [What, I, indeed?]
disapproving that he should think otherwise than
that. (Mughnee. [See also art. انى.]) ―
-b5-  [Fifthly,] it is syn. with قَدْ: so it is said to be in the
saying [in the Kur lxxxvii. 9], إِنْ نَفَعَتِ الذِّكْرَى
[Admonition hath profited], (T, Mughnee, K,)
by IAar (T) and by Ktr: (Mughnee:) and Abu-l-' Abbás relates that the Arabs say, إِنٌ نَفَعَتِ الذِّكْرَى
meaning قَدْ قَامَ زَيْدٌ [Zeyd has stood]; and he
adds, that Ks states his having heard them say so,
and having thought that it expressed a condition,
but that he asked them, and they answered that
they meant قَدْ قَامَ زَيْدٌ, and not مَا قَامَ زَيْدٌ. (T.)
[So too, accord. to the K, in all the exs. cited in
the next sentence as from the Mughnee; but this
is evidently a mistake, occasioned by an accidental
omission.] ―
-b6-  [Sixthly,] it is asserted also by the
Koofees, that it is syn. with إِذْ, in the following
exs.: in the Kur [v. 62], وَاتَّقُوا اللّٰهَ إِنٌ كُنْتُمْ
مُؤْمِنِينَ [And fear ye God, because ye are believers: and so, accord. to AZ, as is said in the
T, in a similar instance in the Kur ii. 278: and
in the same, iv. 62]: and [in the Kur xlviii. 27,]
لَتَدْ خُلُنَّ المَسْجِدَ الْحَرَامَ إِنْ شَآءَ آمِنِينَ [Ye
shall assuredly enter the sacred mosque, because
God hath willed, in security]: and in like instances,
when the verb therein expresses what is held sure
to happen or to have happened: and in the saying,
أَتَغْضَبُ إِنٌ أُدْنَا قُتَيْبَةَ حُزَّتَا
جِهَارًا وَلَمْ تَغْضَبْ لِقَتْلِ ابْنِ حَازِمِ
[Art thou angry because the ears of Kuteybeh
have been cut, openly, or publicly, and wast not
angry for the slaughter of Ibn-Házim?]: (Mughnee:) but in all these instances [it is sufficiently
obvious that] ان may be otherwise explained.
(Mughnee, K.) ―
-b7-  [Seventhly,] it is sometimes
syn. with إِذَا; as in the Kur [ix. 23], لَا تَتَّخِذُوا
آبَآءَكُمْ وَإِخْوَانَكُمْ أَوْلِيَآءَ إِنِ اسْتَحَبُّوا الْكُفْرَعَلَى
الْإِيمَانِ [Take not ye your fathers and your
brethren as friends when they love unbelief above
belief]; and in the same [xxxiii. 49], وَامْرَأَةً مُؤْمِنَةً
إِنْ وَهَبَتْ نَفْسَهَا لِلنَّبِىّ [And a believing woman
when she giveth herself to the Prophet]: so says
AZ. (T.) ―
-b8-  [Eighthly,] it is used for إِمَّا,
(Mughnee and K, voce إِمَّا,) distinct from إِمَّا
which is a compound of the conditional إِنٌ and
the redundant مَا. (Mughnee ibid.) [See an ex.
in a verse cited voce إِمَّا in the present work,
commencing with the words سَقَتْهُ الرَّوَاعِدُ.]
أَنَ: see أَنْ, in four places.
أَنَّ is one of the particles which annul the
quality of the inchoative; and is originally إِنَّ;
therefore Sb has not mentioned it among those
particles [as distinct from إِنَّ, from which, however, it is distinguished in meaning]: (I 'Ak
p. 90:) it is a corroborative particle; (I 'Ak,
Mughnee;) a particle governing the subject in
the accus. case and the predicate in the nom. case,
(S, I 'Ak, Mughnee, K,) combining with what
follows it to form an equivalent to an inf. n., (S,)
[for,] accord. to the most correct opinion, it is
a conjunct particle, which, together with its two
objects of government, is explained by means of
an inf. n. (Mughnee.) If the predicate is derived,
the inf. n. by means of which it is explained is
of the same radical letters; so that the implied
meaning of بَلَغَنِي أَنَّكَ تَنْطَلِقُ [It has come to my
knowledge, or been related to me, or been told
to me, or it came to my knowledge, &c., that thou
goest away], or أَنَّكَ مُنْطَلِقٌ [that thou art going
away], is بَلَغَنِي الاِنْطِلَاقُ [or rather انْطِلَاقُكَ thy
going away has come to my knowledge, &c.];
and hence, the implied meaning of بَلَغَنِى أَنَّكَ فِي
الدَّارِ [It has come to my knowledge, &c., that thou
art in the house] is بَلَغَنِى اسْتِقْرَارُكَ فِي الدَّارِ [thy
remaining in the house has come to my knowledge,
&c.], because thea predicate is properly a word
suppressed from اِستَقَرَّ or مُسْتَقِرٌّ: and if the predicate is underived, the implied meaning is explained by the word كَوْنِ; so that the implied
meaning of بَلَغَنِى أَنَّ هٰذا زَيْدٌ [It has come to
my knowledge, &c., that this is Zeyd] is بَلَغَنِى
كَوْنُهُ زَيْدًا [his being Zeyd has come to my knowledge, &c.]; for the relation of every predicate
expressed by an underived word to its subject
may be denoted by a word signifying “ being; ”
so that you say, هٰذَا زَيْدٌ and, if you will, هٰذَا
كَائِنٌ زَيْدًا; both signifying the same. (Mughnee.) There are cases in which either أَنَّ or إِنَّ
may be used: [see the latter, in twelve places:]
other cases in which only the former may be
used: and others in which only the latter. (I 'Ak
p. 91.) The former only may be used when the
implied meaning is to be explained by an inf. n.
(I 'Ak, K.) Such is the case when it occurs in
the place of a noun governed by a verb in the
nom. case; as in يُعْجِبُنِى أَنَّكَ قَائِمٌ [It pleases
me that thou art standing], i. e. قِيَامُكَ [thy
standing pleases me]: or in the place of a noun
governed by a verb in the accus. case; as in
عَرَفْتُ أَتَّكَ قَائِمٌ [I knew that thou wast standing],
i. e. قِيَامَكَ [thy standing]: or in the place of a
noun governed in the gen. case by a particle;
as in عَجِبْتُ مِنْ أَنَّكَ قَائِمٌ [I wondered that thou
wast standing], i. e. مِنْ قِيَامكَ [at, or by reason
of, thy standing]: (I 'Ak p. 91:) [and sometimes
a preposition is understood; as in لَا شَكَّ أَنَّهُ كَذَا,
for لَا شَكَّ فِى أَنَّهُ كَذَا There is no doubt that
it is thus, i. e. لَا شّكَّ فِى كَوْنِهِ كَذَا There is no
doubt of its being thus:] and أَنَّ must be used
after لَوْ; as in لَوْ أَنَّكَ قَائِمٌ لَقُمْتُ [If that thou
wert standing, I had stood, or would have stood,
i. e. لَوْ ثَبَتَ قِيَامُكَ, or لَوْ قِيَامُكَ ثَابِتٌ, accord. to
different opinions, both meaning if thy standing
were a fact: see I 'Ak pp. 305 and 306]. (K.)
Sometimes its أ is changed into ع; so that you
say, عَلِمْتُ عَنَّكَ مُنْطَلِقٌ [meaning I knew that
thou wast going away]. (M.) ―
-b2-  With ك prefixed to it, it is a particle of comparison, (S, * M,
TA,) [still] governing the subject in the accus.
case and the predicate in the nom. case: (TA:)
you say, كَأَنَّ زَيْدًا عَمْرٌو [It is as though Zeyd
were 'Amr], meaning that Zeyd is like 'Amr; as
though you said, إِنَّ زَيْدًا كَائِنٌ كَعَمْرٍو [verily,
Zeyd is like 'Amr]: [it is to be accounted for by
an ellipsis: or] the ك is taken away from the
middle of this proposition, and put at its commencement, and then the kesreh of إِنَّ necessarily
becomes changed to a fet-hah, because إِنَّ cannot
be preceded by a preposition, for it never occurs
but at the commencement [of a proposition]. (IJ,
M.) Sometimes, كَأَنَّ denotes denial; as in the
saying, كَأَنَّكَ أَمِيرُنَا فَتَأْمُرَنَا [As though thou wert
our commander so that thou shouldst command
us], meaning thou art not our commander [that
thou shouldst command us]. (TA.) It also denotes wishing; as in the saying, كَأْنَّكَ بِي قَدْ
قُلْتُ الشِّعْرَ فَأُجِيدَهُ, meaning Would that I had
poetized, or versified, so that I might do it well:
(TA:) [an elliptical form of speech, of which the
implied meaning seems to be, would that I were
as though thou sawest me that I had poetized,
&c.; or the like: for] you say [also], كَأَنِّى بِكَ
meaning كَأَنِّى أَبْصُرُ بِكَ [It is as though I saw
thee]; i. e. I know from what I witness of thy
condition to-day how thy condition will be tomorrow; so that it is as though I saw thee in
that condition: (Har p. 126: [see also بِ; near
the end of the paragraph:]) [thus,] كَأَنَّ also denotes knowing; and also thinking; [the former as
in the saying immediately preceding, and] as when
you say, كَأَنَّ اللّٰهَ يَفْعَلُ مَا يَشَآءُ [I know, or rather
it appears, as though seen, that God does what
He wills]; and [the latter as when you say,]
كَأَنَّكَ خَارِجٌ [I think, or rather it seems, that
Thou art going forth]. (TA.) ―
-b3-  [When it has
The affixed pronoun of the first person, sing. Or
Pl., you say, أَنِّى and أَنَّنِى, and أَنَّا and أَنَّنَا: and
When it has also the ك of comparison prefixed to
It,] you say, كَأَنِّى and كَأَنَّنِى, [and كَأَنَّا and
كَأَنَّنَا,] like as you say, لٰكِنِّى and لٰكِنَّنِى [&c.].
(S.) ―
-b4-  As أَنَّ is a derivative from إِنَّ, it is correctly asserted by Z that أَنَّمَا imports restriction,
like ↓ إِنَّمَا; both of which occur in the saying
in the Kur [xxi. 108], يُوحَى إِلَىَّ أَنَّمَا ↓ قُلْ إِنَّمَا
إِلٰهُكُمْ إِلٰهً وَاحِدٌ [Say thou, It is only revealed to
me that your God is only one God]: the former
is for the restricting of the quality to the qualified;
and the latter, for the reverse: (Mughnee, K:)
i. e. the former is for the restricting of the revelation to the declaration of the unity; and the
latter, for the restricting of “ your God ” to unity:
(Marginal note in a copy of the Mughnee:) but
these words of the Kur do not imply that nothing
save the unity was revealed to the Prophet; for
the restriction is limited to the case of the discourse
with the believers in a plurality of gods; so that
the meaning is, there has not been revealed to
me [aught], respecting the godhead, except the
unity; not the attribution of any associate to God.
(Mughnee.) [أَنَّمَا, however, does not always import restriction; nor does always even ↓ إِنَّمَا: in
each of these, ما is what is termed كَافَّةٌ; i. e.,
it restricts the particle to which it is affixed from
exercising any government; and sometimes has
no effect upon the signification of that particle:
(see art. مَا; and see إِنَّمَا, below, voce إِنَّ:) thus,
for instance, in the Kur viii. 28, وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّمَا
أَمْوَالُكُمْ فِتْنَةً means And know ye that
your possessions and your children are a trial;
not that they are only a trial. When it has the
ك of comparison prefixed to it, it is sometimes
contracted; as in the following ex.:] a poet says,
كَأَمَّا يَخْتَطِينَ عَشلَى قَتَادٍ
وَيَسْتَضْحِكْنَ عَنْ حَبِّ الغَمَامِ
[As though, by reason of their mincing gait, they
were walking upon tragacanthas; and they were
laughing so as to discover teeth like hailstones:
كَأَمَّا being for كَأَنَّمَا. (IAar.) ―
-b5-  أَنَّ is someTimes contracted into أَنْ; (S, Mughnee;) and in
This case, it governs in the manner already exPlained, voce أَنْ. (Mughnee.) ―
-b6-  It is also syn.
with لَعَلَّ; (Sb, S, M, Mughnee, K;) as in the
saying, اِيتِ السُّوقَ أَنَّكَ تَشْتَرِى لَنَا شَيْئًا [Come thou
to the market; may-be thou wilt buy for us something; اِيتِ being originally اِئْتِ]; i. e. لَعَلَّكَ:
(Sb, M, Mughnee, K: *) and, accord. to some,
(M, Mughnee, K,) so in the Kur [vi. 109], where
it is said, وَمَا يُشْعِرُكُمْ أَنَّهَا إِذَا جَآءَتْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ
[And what maketh you to know? (meaning,
maketh you to know that they will believe when
it cometh? i. e. ye do not know that: Jel:) Maybe, when it cometh, they will not believe]: (S, M,
Mughnee, K:) thus accord. to this reading:
(Mughnee, K:) and Ubeí here reads لَعَلَّهَا. (S.)
أَنَّ and لَأَنَّ and لَوْ أَنَّ are all syn. with عَلَّ and
لَعَلَّ; and أَنِّى and أَنَّنِى, and لَأَنِّى and لأَنَّنِى, and
لُوْ أَنِّى and لَوْ أَنِّنِى, with عَلِّى and لَعَلِّى. (K voce
لَعَلَّ.) ―
-b7-  It is also syn. with أَجَلْ [Yes, or yea;
or it is as thou sayest]. (M, TA.) [See also إِنَّ
as exemplified by a verse commencing with وَيَقُلْنَ
and by a saying of Ibn-Ez-Zubeyr.]
إِنَّ is one of the particles which annul the
quality of the inchoative, like أَنَّ, of which it is
the original: (I 'Ak p. 90:) it is a corroborative
particle, (I 'Ak, Mughnee,) corroborating the
predicate; (S, K;) governing the subject in the
accus. case and the predicate in the nom. case;
(S, I 'Ak, Mughnee, K;) [and may generally be
rendered by Verily, or certainly, or the like;
exactly agreeing with the Greek
ὃτι, as used in
Luke vii. 16 and in many other passages in the
New Testament; though it often seems to be
nothing more than a sign of inception, which can
hardly be rendered at all in English; unless in
pronunciation, by laying a stress upon the predicate, or upon the copula;] as in the saying,
إِنَّ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ [Verily, or certainly, Zeyd is standing; or simply, Zeyd is standing, if we lay a
stress upon standing, or upon is]. (I 'Ak p. 90.)
But sometimes it governs both the subject and
the predicate in the accus. case; as in the saying,
إِذَا اشْتَدَّ جُنْحُ اللَّيْلِ فَلْتَأْتِ وَلْتَكُنٌ
خُطَاكَ خِفَافًا إِنَّ حُرَّاسَنَا أُسْدَا
[When the darkness of night becomes, or shall
become, intense, then do thou come, and let thy
steps be light: verily our guardians are lions];
(Mughnee, K; [but in the latter, for اشْتَدَّ, we
find اسْوَدَّ, so that the meaning is, when the first
portion of the night becomes, or shall become, black,
&c.;]) and as in a trad. in which it is said,
انَّ قَعْرَ جَهَنَّمَ سَبْعِينَ خَرِيفًا [Verily the bottom of
Hell is a distance of seventy years of journeying]:
(Mughnee, K:) the verse, however, is explained
by the supposition that it presents a denotative of
state [in the last word, which is equivalent to
شِجْعَانًا or the like], and that the predicate is suppressed, the meaning being, تَلْقَاهُمْ أُسْدًا [thou
wilt find them lions]; and the trad. by the supposition that قَعْرَ is an inf. n., and سَبْعِينَ is an
adverbial noun, so that the meaning is, the reaching the bottom of hell is [to be accomplished in
no less time than] in seventy years. (Mughnee.)
And sometimes the inchoative [of a proposition]
after it is in the nom. case, and its subject is what
is termed ضَمِيرُ شَأْنٍ, suppressed; as in the saying
of Mohammad, إِنَّ مِنْ أَشَدِّ النَّاسِ عَذَابًا يَوْمَ القِيٰمَةِ
المُصَوِّرُونَ [Verily, (the case is this:) of the men
most severely to be punished, on the day of resurrection, are the makers of images], originally إِنَّهُ,
i. e. إِنَّ الشَّأْنَ; (Mughnee, K; *) and as in the
saying in the Kur [xx. 66], إِنَّ هٰذَانِ لَسَاحِرَانِ,
[accord. to some,] as will be seen in what follows.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  Of the two particles إِنَّ and ↓ أَنَّ, in
certain cases only the former may be used; and
in certain other cases either of them may be used.
(I' Ak p. 91.) The former must be used when it
occurs inceptively, (Kh, T, I' Ak p. 92, Mughnee,
K,) having nothing before it upon which it is syntactically dependent, (Kh, T,) with respect to the
wording or the meaning; (K;) as in إِنَّ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ
[Verily Zeyd is standing]. (I' Ak, K.) It is used
after أَلَا, (I' Ak, K,) the inceptive particle, (I' Ak,)
or the particle which is employed to give notice [of
something about to be said]; (K;) as in أَلَا إِنَّ
زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ [Now surely Zeyd is standing]. (I' Ak
K.) And when it occurs at the commencement
of the complement of a conjunct noun; (I' Ak,
K; *) as in جَآءَ الَّذِى إِنَّهُ قَائِمٌ [He who is standing
came]; (I' Ak;) and in the Kur [xxviii. 76],
وَآتَيْنَاهُ مِنَ الْكُنُورِ مَا إِنَّ مَفَاتِحَهُ لَتَنُوْءُ بِالْعُصْبَةِ أُولِى
القُوَّةِ [And we gave him, of treasures, that whereof
the keys would weigh down the company of men
possessed of strength]. (I' Ak, * K, * TA.) And in
the complement of an oath, (I' Ak, K,) when its
predicate has لَ, (I' Ak,) or whether its subject
or its predicate has لَ or has it not; (K;) as in
وَاللّٰهِ إِنَّ زَيْدًا لَقَائِمٌ [By Allah, verily Zeyd is
standing], (I' Ak,) and إِنَّهُ قَائِمٌ: or, as some say,
when you do not employ the ل, the particle is
with fet-h; as in قَائِمٌ ↓ وَاللّٰهِ أَنَّكَ [I swear by
Allah that thou art standing]; mentioned by Ks
as thus heard by him from the Arabs: (TA:)
but respecting this case we shall have to speak
hereafter. (I' Ak.) And when it occurs after the
word قَوْلٌ or a derivative thereof, in repeating the
saying to which that word relates; (Fr, T, I' Ak, *
K; *) as in the saying [in the Kur iv. 156],
وَقَوْلِهِمْ إِنَّا قَتَلْنَا الْمَسِيحَ [And their saying, Verily
we have slain the Messiah]; (Fr, T;) and قُلْتُ
إِنَّ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ [I said, Verily Zeyd is standing];
(I' Ak;) and [in the Kur v. 115,] قَالَ اللّٰهُ إِنّى
مُنّزِّلُهَا عَلَيْكُمْ [God said, Verily I will cause it to
descend unto you]; accord. to the dial. of him
who does not pronounce it with fet-h: (K:) but
when it occurs in explaining what is said, you use
↓ أَنَّ; as in the saying, قَدْ قُلْتُ لَكَ كَلَامًا حَسَنًا
أَنَّ أَبَاكَ شَرِيفٌ وَأَنَّكَ عَاقِلٌ [I have said to thee a
good saying; that thy father is noble and that
thou art intelligent]; (Fr, T;) or when the word
signifying “ saying ” is used as meaning “ thinking; ” as in أَتَقُولُ أَنَّ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ [Dost thou say
that Zeyd is standing?], meaning أَتَظُنُّ [Dost
thou think?]. (I' Ak.) Also, when it occurs in a
phrase denotative of state; (I' Ak;) [i. e.,] after
the و denotative of state; (K;) as in زُرْتُهُ وَإِنِّى
ذُوأَمَلٍ [I visited him, I verily having hope, or
expectation]; (I' Ak;) and in جَآءَ زِيْدٌ وَ إِنَّ يَدَهُ
عَلَى رَأْسِهِ [Zeyd came, he verily having his hand
upon his head]. (K.) And when it occurs in a
phrase which is the predicate of a proper (as
opposed to an ideal) substantive; (I' Ak, K; *)
as in زَيْدٌ إِنَّهُ قَائِمٌ [Zeyd, verily he is standing],
(I' Ak,) or ذَاهِبٌ [going away]; contr. to the
assertion of Fr. (K.) And when it occurs before
the ل which suspends the grammatical government of a verb of the mind, preceding it, with
respect to its objective complements; (I' Ak, K; *)
as in عَلِمْتُ إِنَّ زَيْدًا لَقَائِمٌ [I knew Zeyd verily
was standing]; (I' Ak;) and in [the Kur lxiii. 1,]
وَاللّٰهُ يَعْلَمُ إِنَّكَ لَرَسُولُهُ [And God knoweth thou
verily art his apostle]: (K:) but if the ل is not
in its predicate, you say, ↓ أَنَّ; as in عَلِمْتُ أَنَّ
زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ [I knew that Zeyd was standing].
(I' Ak.) And in the like of the saying in the Kur
[ii. 171], وَإِنَّ الَّذِينَ اخْتَلَفُوا فِى الْكِتَابِ لَفِى شَقَاقٍ
بَعِيدٍ [And verily they who differ among themselves
respecting the book are in an opposition remote
from the truth]; because of the ل [of inception]
which occurs after it, in لَفِى: (Ks, A 'Obeyd:)
the ل of inception which occurs before the predicate of إِنَّ should properly commence the sentence;
so that إِنَّ زَيْدًا لَقَائِمٌ [Verily Zeyd is standing]
should properly be لَإِنَّ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ; but as the ل
is a corroborative and إِنَّ is a corroborative, they
dislike putting two particles of the same meaning
together, and therefore they put the ل later, transferring it to the predicate: Mbr allows its being
put before the predicate of ↓ أَنَّ; and thus it
occurs in an unusual reading of the saying [in the
Kur xxv. 22], إِلَّا أَنَّهُمْ لَيَأْكُلُونَ الطَّعَامَ [But they
ate food]; but this is explained by the supposition
that the ل is here redundant: (I' Ak p. 95:) this
is the reading of Sa'eed Ibn-Jubeyr: others read,
إِلَّا إِنَّهُمْ لَيَأْكُلُنَ الطَّعَامَ [but verily they ate food]:
and إِنَّ [as well as ↓ أَنَّ] is used after the exceptive
إِلَّا when it is not followed by the ل [of inception].
(TA.) Also, When it occurs after حَيْثُ; as in
اِجْلِسْ حَيْثُ إِنَّ زَيْدًا جَالِسٌ [Sit thou where Zeyd
is sitting]. (I' Ak p. 92, and k) And after
حَتَّى; as in مَرِضَ زَيْدٌ حَتَّى إِنَّهُمْ لَا يَرْجُونَهُ [Zeyd
has fallen sick, so that verily they have no hope
for him: whereas after a particle governing the
gen. case, [i. e. a preposition,] you say, ↓ أَنَّ.
(IHsh in De Sacy's Anthol. Gr. Ar. P. 76.) ―
-b3-
Either of these two forms may be used after إِذَا
denoting a thing's happening suddenly, or unexpectedly; as in خَرَجْتُ فَإِذَا إِنَّ زَيْدًاقَائِمٌ [I went
forth, and lo, verily Zeyd was standing], and
زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ ↓ فَإِذَا أَنَّ [and lo, or at that present
time, Zeyd's standing]; in which latter case, أَنَّ
with its complement is [properly] an inchoative,
and its enunciative is إِذَا; the implied meaning
being, and at that present time was the standing
of Zeyd: or it may be that the enunciative is
suppressed, and that the implied meaning is, [and
lo, or at that present time,] the standing of Zeyd
was an event come to pass. (I' Ak p. 93.) Also,
when occurring in the complement of an oath, if
its enunciative is without ل: (I' Ak:) [see exs.
given above:] or, as some say, only ↓ أَنَّ is used
in this case. (TA.) Also, when occurring after
فَ denoting the complement of a condition; as in
مَنْ يَأْتِنِى فَإِنَّهُ مُكْرَمٌ [He who cometh to me, verily
he shall be treated with honour], and مُكْرَمٌ ↓ أَنَّهُ;
in which latter case, أَنَّ with its complement is an
inchoative, and the enunciative is suppressed; the
implied meaning being, honourable treatment of
him shall be an event come to pass: or it may be
an enunciative to an inchoative suppressed; the
implied meaning being, his recompense shall be
honourable treatment. (I' Ak p. 94.) Also, when
occurring after an inchoative having the meaning
of a saying, its enunciative being a saying, and
the sayer being one; as in خَيْرُ القَوْلِ إِنّى أَحْمَدُ
[The best saying is, Verily I praise God], and
أَحْمَدُ ↓ أَنِّى; in which latter case, أَنَّ with its
complement is an enunciative of خَيْرُ; the implied
meaning being, the best saying is the praising of
God [or my praising of God]. (I' Ak ubi suprà.)
You also say, لَبَّيْكَ إِنَّ الحَمْدَلَكَ [At thy service !
Verily praise belongeth to Thee! O God]; commencing [with إِنَّ] a new proposition: and sometimes one says, ↓ أَنَّ; meaning بِأَنَّ الحَمْدَ لَكَ
[because praise belongeth to Thee]. (Msb.) ―
-b4-
The cases in which إِن may not be used in the
place of أَنَّ have been mentioned above, voce أَنَّ.
―
-b5-  [When it has the affixed pronoun of the first
person, sing. or pl.,] you say, إِنِّى and إِنَّنِى, (S,)
and إِنَّا and إِنَّنَا, (TA,) like as you say لٰكِنِّى and
لٰكِنِّنِى [&c.]. (S.) إِنَّ as a contraction of إِنَّ أَنَا
has been mentioned above, as occurring in the
phrase إِنَّ قَائِمٌ, voce إِنْ, q. v. ―
-b6-  Accord. to the
grammarians, (T,) إِنَّمَا is a compound of إِنَّ and مَا,
(T, S,) which latter prevents the former's having
any government: (T:) it imports restriction;
like أَنَّمَا, which see above, voce أَنَّ, in three
places: (Mughnee, K:) [i. e.] it imports the
restriction of that which it precedes to that which
follows it; as in إِنَّمَا زَيْدٌ مُنْطَلِقٌ [Zeyd is only
going away], and إِنَّمَا يَنْطَلِقُ زَيْدٌ [Only Zeyd goes
away]: (Bd in ii. 10:) [in other words,] it is
used to particularize, or specify, or distinguish a
thing from other things: (S:) it affirms a thing
in relation to that which is mentioned after it, and
denies it in relation to other things; (T, S;) as
in the saying in the Kur [ix. 60], إِنَّمَا الصَّدَقَاتُ
لِلْفُقَرَآءِ [The contributions levied for pious uses
are only, or but, for the poor]: (S:) but El-
Ámidee and AHei say that it does not import
restriction, but only corroboration of an affirmation, because it is a compound of the corroborative
إِنَّ and the redundant مَا which restrains the
former from exercising government, and that it
has no application to denote negation implied in
restriction, as is shown by the trad., إِنَّمَا الِّرِبَا فِى
النَّسِيْئَةِ [which must mean, Verily usury is in the
delay of payment], for usury is in other things
beside that here mentioned, as رِبَا الفضْلِ [or profit
obtained by the superior value of a thing received
over that of a thing given], by common consent:
(Kull p. 76:) some say that it necessarily imports
restriction: J says what has been cited above from
the S: some say that it has an overt signification
in denoting restriction, and is susceptible of the
meaning of corroboration: some say the reverse
of this: El-Ámidee says that if it were [properly]
restrictive, its occurrence in another sense would
be at variance with the original import; but to
this it may be replied, that if it were [properly]
corroborative, its occurrence in another sense
would be at variance with the original import: it
[therefore] seems that it is susceptible of both
these meanings, bearing one or the other according as this or that suits the place. (Msb.) إِنَّمَا is
to be distinguished from إِنَّ with the conjunct
[noun] مَا, which does not restrain it from governing [though its government with this is not apparent, and which is written separately]; as in
إِنَّ مَا عِنْكَ حَسَنٌ meaning Verily what is with
thee is good, and in إِنَّ مَا فَعَلْتَ حَسَنٌ meaning
Verily thy deed is good. (I' Ak pp. 97 and 98.)
―
-b7-  إِنَّ is sometimes contracted into إِنٌ; (S, Mughnee, K;) and in this case, it is made to govern
and is made to have no government: (S:) it is
seldom made to govern in this case; often made
to have no government: the Koofees say that it
is not contracted; (Mughnee, K;) and that when
one says, إِنْ زَيْدٌ لَمُنْطَلِقٌ [the meaning is virtually
Verily Zeyd is going away, but] إِنٌ is a negative
and the ل is syn. with إِلّا; but this assertion is
refuted by the fact that some make it to govern
when contracted, as in exs. cited above, voce إِنْ,
q. v. (Mughnee.) ―
-b8-  It is also syn. with نَعَمٌ
[Even so; yes; yea]; (Mughnee, K;) contr. to
the opinion of AO. (Mughnee.) [See also أَنَّ,
last sentence.] Those who affirm it to have this
meaning cite as an ex. the following verse (Mughnee, K *) of 'Obeyd-Allah Ibn-Keys-er-Rukeiyát:
(S, * TA:)
كَ وَقَدْ كَبِرْتَ فَقُلْتُ إِنَّهْ  وَيَقُلْنَ شَيْبٌ قَدْ عَلَا
[And they say, (namely, the women,) Hoariness
hath come upon thee, and thou hast become old:
and I say, Even so, or yes, or yea]: (Mughnee,
K:) but this has been rebutted by the saying,
We do not concede that the ه is here added to
denote the pause, but assert that it is a pronoun,
governed by إِنَّ in the accus. case, and the predicate is suppressed; the meaning being, إِنَّهُ
كَذٰلِكَ [Verily it, i. e. the case, is thus]. (Mughnee.) [J says,] The meaning is, إنَّهُ قَدْ كَانَ كَمَا
تَقُلْنَ [Verily it, i. e. the case, hath been as ye
say]: A 'Obeyd says, This is a curtailment of
the speech of the Arabs; the pronoun being
deemed sufficient because the meaning is known:
and as to the saying of Akh, that it signifies نَعَمْ,
he only means thereby that it may be so rendered,
not that it is originally applied to that signification: he says that the ه is here added to denote
the pause. (S.) There is, however, a good ex.
of إِنَّ in the sense of نَعَمْ in the saying of Ibn-Ez-Zubeyr, to him who said to him, “May God
curse a she camel which carried me to thee,”
إِنَّ وَرَاكِبَهَا, i. e. Even so, or yes, or yea; and
may God curse her rider: for the suppression of
both the subject and the predicate is not allowable.
(Mughnee.) And hence, accord. to Mbr, the
saying in the Kur [xx. 66], as thus read, إِنَّ
هٰذانِ لَسَاحِرَانِ [meaning, if so, Yes, these two are
enchanters]. (Mughnee.) [But this phrase has
given rise to much discussion, related in the
Mughnee and other works. The following is a
brief abstract of what has been said respecting
it by several of the leading authorities.] A booIs-hák says that the people of El-Medeeneh and
El-Koofeh read as above, except 'Ásim, who is
reported to have read, إِنٌ هٰذَانِ, without tesh-deed, and so is Kh; [so too is Hafs, as is said
above, voce إِنْ;] and that AA read إِنَّ هٰذيْنِ,
the former word with teshdeed, and the latter in
the accus. case: that the argument for إِنَّ هٰذَانِ,
with teshdeed and the nom. case, [or rather what
is identical in form with the nom. case,] is, that
it is of the dial. of Kináneh, in which the dual
is formed by the termination ان in the nom.
and accus. and gen. cases alike, as also in the
dial. of Benu-l-Hárith Ibn-Kaab: but that the
old grammarians say that ه is here suppressed;
the meaning being, إِنَّهُ هٰذَانِ: (T:) this last
assertion, however, is weak; for what is applied
to the purpose of corroboration should not be
suppressed, and the instances of its suppression
which have been heard are deviations from general
usage, except in the case of أَنَّ, with fet-h, contracted into أَنْ: (Mughnee:) Aboo-Is-hák then
adds, that some say, إِنَّ is here syn. with نَعَمْ:
this last opinion he holds to be the best; the
meaning being, نَعَمْ هٰذَانِ لَهُمَا سَاحِرَانِ [Yes,
these two, verily they are two enchanters: for
this is not a case in which the ل (which is the ل
of inception) can be regarded as transferred from
its proper place, at the commencement of the
sentence or proposition, as it is in some instances
mentioned in the former half of this paragraph:
but it is said in the Mughnee that this explanation
is invalidated by the fact that the combining of
the corroborative ل and the suppression of the
inchoative is like the combining of two things inconsistent, or incompatible; as is also the opinion
that the ل is redundant, because the redundant ل
prefixed to the enunciative is peculiar to poetry]:
next in point of goodness, in the opinion of A booIs-hák, is, that it is of the dial. of Kináneh and
Benu-l-Hárith Ibn-Kaab: the reading of AA he
does not allow, because it is at variance with the
written text: but he approves the reading of
'Ásim and Kh. (T.)
-A2-  إِنَّ also occurs as a
verb: it is the third person pl. fem. of the pret.
from الأَيْنُ, syn. with التَّعَبُ; or from آنَ syn.
with قَرُبَ: or the third person sing. masc. of the
pret. passive from الأَنيِنُ, in the dial. of those
who, for رُدَّ and حُبَّ, say رِدَّ and حِبَّ, likening
these verbs to قِيلَ and بِيعَ: or the sing. masc.
of the imperative from the same: or the pl. fem.
of the imperative from الأَيْنُ; or from آنَ syn.
with قَرُبَ: or the sing. fem. of the corroborated
form of the imperative from وَأَى, syn. with وَعَدَ.
(Mughnee.)
أَنَا, signifying I: see أَنْ, in seven places.
أَنَهٌ, signifying I: see أَنْ, in two places.
أَنَّةٌ i. q. أَنِينٌ [inf. n. of أَنَّ, but app. a simple
subst., signifying A moan, moaning, or prolonged
voice of complaint; or a saying Ah: or a complaint: or a cry]. (TA.)
أَنْتَ, signifying Thou: fem. أَنْتِ; dual أَنْتُمَا;
pl. masc. أَنْتُمْ, and pl. fem. أَنْتُنَّ: see أَنْ, in
six places.
أُنَنَةٌ see أَنَّانٌ
أُنَانٌ see أَنَّانٌ
أَنَّانٌ One who moans; who utters a moaning,
or prolonged voice of complaint; or who says
Ah; much, or frequently; as also ↓ أُنَانٌ and
↓ أُنَنَةٌ: (M, K:) or this last signifies one who
publishes complaint, or makes it public, much, or
frequently: (M:) or one who talks and grieves
and complains much, or frequently; and it has
no verb derived from it: (T:) and you say,
رَجُلٌ أُنَنَةٌ قُنَنَةٌ, [in which the latter epithet is app.
an imitative sequent to the former,] meaning an
eloquent man. (TA.) The fem. of أَنَّانٌ is with
ة: (M, K:) and is said to be applied to a woman
who moans, or says Ah, and is affected with
compassion, for a dead husband, on seeing another
whom she has married after the former. (MF.)
[See also حَنَّانَةٌ, voce حَنَّانٌ.]
آنَ, signifying I: see أَنْ, in two places.
آنٌّ part. n. of أَنَّ, [Moaning; or uttering a
moan or moaning or a prolonged voice of complaint; or saying Ah; by reason of pain: complaining by reason of disease or pain: or] uttering a cry or cries: fem. with ة. (Msb.) [Hence,]
you say, مَا لَهُ حَانَّةٌ وَلَا آنَّةٌ He has not a she camel
nor a sheep, or goat: (S, M, A, K:) or he has
not a she camel nor a female slave (M, K) that
moans by reason of fatigue. (M.)
مَئِنَّةٌ, occurring in a trad., (S, Mgh, K, &c.,
in the first and last in art. مأن, and in the second
in the present art.,) where it is said, إِنَّ طُولَ
الصَّلَاةِ وَقِصَرَ الخُطْبَةِ مَئِنَّةٌ مِنْ فِقْهِ الرَّجُلِ, (S, Mgh,
TA, &c.,) is of the measure مَفعِلَةٌ وَقِصَرَ الخُطْبَةِ مَئِنَّةٌ مِنْ فِقْهِ الرَّجُلِ, [originally
مَأْنِنَةٌ,] from إِنَّ, (S, Z in the Fáïk, IAth, Mgh,
K,) the corroborative particle; (Z, IAth, Mgh;)
like مَعْسَاةٌ from عَسَى; (S, K;) but not regularly
derived from إِنَّ, because a word may not be
so derived from a particle; or it may be said
that this is so derived after the particle has been
made a noun; (Z, IAth;) or neither of these
modes of derivation is regular: (MF:) the meaning is, [Verily the longness of the prayer and
the shortness of the oration from the pulpit are
(together)] a proper ground for one's saying,
Verily the man is a person of knowledge or intelligence: (Z, * Mgh, K in art. مأن:) this is the
proper signification: accord. to AO, the meaning
is, a thing whereby one learns the knowledge, or
intelligence, of the man: (Mgh:) or it means
a thing suitable to, (S, Mgh,) and whereby one
knows, (S,) the knowledge, or intelligence, of the
man: (S, Mgh:) or a sign (As, S, K) of the
knowledge, or intelligence, of the man; and suitable thereto: (As, S:) or an evidence thereof:
(M:) or an indication, or a symptom, thereof;
everything that indicates a thing being said to
be مَئِنَّةٌ لَهُ: [so that مَئِنَّةٌ لِكَذَا may be well rendered a thing that occasions one's knowing, or
inferring, or suspecting, such a thing; and in
like manner, a person that occasions one's doing
so: or, more properly, a thing, &c., in which
such a thing is usually known to take place, or
have place, or be, or exist, like مَظِنَّةٌ:] one of
the strangest of the things said of it is, that the ء
is a substitute for the ظ of مَظِنَّةٌ: (IAth:) this
seems to have been the opinion of Lh: (Az, L:)
accord. to AA, it is syn. with آيَةٌ [a sign, &c.].
(TA.) As says (S, * K, TA, all in art. مأن) that
the word is thus, with teshdeed to the ن, in the
trad. and in a verse of poetry, as these are related;
(S, TA;) but correctly, in his opinion, it should
be مَئِينَةٌ of the measure فَعِيلَةٌ, (S, K, * TA,)
unless it be from إِنَّ, as first stated above: (S,
TA:) AZ used to say that it is مَئِتَّةٌ, with ت,
(S, K, * TA,) meaning a thing (lit. a place) meet,
fit, or proper, or worthy or deserving, and the like;
of the measure مَفْعِلَةٌ, [originally مَأْتِتَةٌ,] from أَتَّهُ
meaning “he overcame him with an argument
or the like:” (S, K, TA:) but some say that
it is of the measure فَعِلَّةٌ, from مَأَنَ meaning
اِحْتَمَلَ: see art. مأن. (K in that art.) You say
also, هُوَ مَئِنَّةٌ لِلْخَيْرِ, from إِنَّ, He is a person fit,
or proper, for one's saying of him, Verily he is
good; and in like manner, مَعْسَاةٌ, from عَسَى, as
meaning “a person fit, or proper, for one's saying of him, May-be he will do good.” (A, TA.)
And إِنَّهُ لَمَئِنَّةٌ أَنْ يَكُونَ كَذَا Verily it is meet,
fit, or proper, for one's saying of it, Verily it
is thus; or is worthy, or deserving, of one's saying &c.: or verily it is a thing meet, fit, or
proper, for one's saying &c.; or is a thing worthy,
or deserving, of one's saying &c.: of the measure
مَفْعِلَةٌ, from إِنَّ. (K in the present art.) And
إِنَّهُ لَمَئِنَّةٌ أَنْ يَفْعَلَ ذَاكَ Verily he is meet, fit, or
proper, for doing that; or is worthy, or deserving,
of doing that: or verily he is a person meet, fit,
or proper, for doing that; or is a person worthy,
or deserving, of doing that: and in like manner
you say of two, and of more, and of a female:
but مَئِنَّةٌ may be of the measure فَعِلَّةٌ [from مأن],
i. e. a triliteral-radical word. (M.) ―
-b2-  You also
say, أَتَاهُ عَلَي مَئنَّة ذَاكَ, meaning He came to him
at the time, or season, [or fit or proper time,]
of that; and at the first thereof. (M.)
