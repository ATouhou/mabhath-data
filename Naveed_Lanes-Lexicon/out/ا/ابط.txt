ابط1
أَبَطَهُ i. q. هَبَطَهُ, q. v.: (IAar, Az, Sgh, K:)
said of God. (K.)
5
تأبّطهُ He put it (a thing, S Mgh, Msb)
beneath his إِبْط [or arm-pit]; (S, Msb, K;) or in
his إِبْط. (Mgh.) ―
-b2-  Hence, (K,) تَأَبَّطَ شَرَّا, the
surname of Thábit the son of Jábir (S, K) ElFahmee: (S:) because they assert that the sword
never quitted him: (S:) or because he put beneath his arm—pit a quiver of arrows, and took a
bow, or put beneath his arm—pit a knife, and came
to an assembly of Arabs, and smote some of them.
(K.) It is invariable: but if you desire to express
the dual or pl., you say, ذَوَا تَأَبَّطَ شَرًّا and ذَوُو تَأَبَّطَ
شَرٍّا, or you say كِلَاهُمَا and كُلُّهُمْ. (S.) It does
not admit of the formation of a dim., nor is it
abridged: (S, K:) but some of the Arabs used
to say تَأَبَّطُ [so written with refa], using a single
word, accord. to Sb, as is said in the L. (TA.)
Its rel. n. is ↓ تَأَبَّطِىٌّ. (S, K.) ―
-b3-  [Hence also]
تأبّط فُلَانٌ فُلَانًا (assumed tropical:)  Such a one placed such a one
under his protection. (TA.) ―
-b4-  تأبّط also signifies
He put his رِدَآء, (S,) or garment, (Mgh, K,)
under his right arm, and then threw [a portion
of] it over his left shoulder, (S, Mgh, K,) in
prayer, or in إِحْرَام; (Mgh;) as also اِضْطَبَعَ.
(S.) [See also تَوَشَّحَ.]
إِبْطٌ [The armpit;] the inner side of the shoulderjoint: (ISd, K:) or the part beneath the جَنَاح
[which signifies the arm, upper arm, armpit, and
wing, &c.]: (S, Msb:) also written ↓ إِبِطٌ; (Msb,
K;) which is said to be a dial. var. by some of
the moderns; but this is strange, on account of
what is said respecting إِبِلٌ; (Msb;) for Sb says
that there are only two substs. of the measure فِعِلٌ,
which are إِبِلٌ and حِبِرٌ; and one epithet, namely
بِلِزٌ: other instances have been mentioned, but
their transmission from Sb is not established:
(Msb. in art. ابل:) it is also said that there is no
other word like إِبِلٌ; but this means, in its original form, and does not deny that there are words
like it by the insertion of a second vowel like the
first, such as this and many other words: (TA:)
[see also إِبِدٌ:] it is fem.; (Mgh;) or masc. and
fem.; (S, Msb;) sometimes the latter; (Lh, K;)
but the making it mase. is more approved: (TA:)
Fr cites, from certain of the Arabs, the phrase,
(S,) فَرَفَعَ السَّوْطَ حَتَّى بَرَقَتْ إِبْطُهُ [And he raised
the whip so that his armpit shone]: (S, Msb:)
the pl. is آبَاطٌ. (S, Msb, K.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] ضَرَبَ
آبَاطَ الأُمُورِ وَمَغَابِنَهَا (tropical:)  [He hit the secret and occult
particulars of the affairs]. (A, TA [followed by
the words وَ اشْتَقَّ ضَمَائِرَهَا وَبَوَاطِنَهَا, a pleonastic
addition, merely explaining what goes before.])
―
-b3-  And ضَرَبَ آبَاطَ المَفَازَةِ (tropical:)  [He traversed the
recesses of the desert]. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And إِبْطُ جَبَلٍ
(assumed tropical:)  The foot, or bottom, or lowest part, (سَفَحْ,) of a
mountain. (TA.) ―
-b5-  And إِبْطُ رَمْلٍ (assumed tropical:)  The place
where the main body of sand ends: (S:) or what
is thin, of sand: (K:) or the lowest part of an
oblong tract of sand collected together and elevated,
where the main body thereof ends, and it becomes
thin. (TA.) ―
-b6-  And إِبعطُ الشِّمَالِ (assumed tropical:)  Evil fortune;
ill luck. (TA.)
إِبِطٌ: see إِبْطٌ.
إِبْطِيٌّ [Of, or relating to, the armpit]. ―
-b2-
الإِبْطِىُّ The axillary vein. (Golius, on the
authority of Meyd.)
السَّيْفُ إِبَاطٌ لِى The sword is beneath my أِبْط [or
armpit]: and السَّيْفُ عِطَا فِى وَ إِبَاطِى I put, or
place, the sword upon my side, and beneath my
إِبْط. (TA.) And جَعَلْتُهُ I put it (namely
the sword, TA) next my إِبْط (K, TA.) The
Hudhalee, (S, TA,) El-Mutanakhkhil, describing
water to which he came to drink, (TA,) says,
(S, TA,) accord. to the Deewán, but some ascribe
the words to Taäbbata—Sharrà, (TA,)
شَرِبْتُ بِجَّمِهِ وَصَدَرْتُ عَنْهُ
وَ أَبْيَضُ صَارِمٌ ذَكَرٌ إِبَاطِى
meaning [I drank of the main body thereof, and
returned from it, and a sharp steel—edged sword
was] beneath my إِبْط: (S, TA:) or, accord. to one
relation, the poet said, بِأَبْيَضَ صَارِمٍ ذَكَرٍ: and accord.
to another, وَ عَضْبٌ صَارِمٌ: Skr says that the last
word of the verse is a contraction of آبَاطِى: and
Ibn-Es-Seeráfee, that it is originally ↓ إِبَاطِىٌّ; and
if so, it is an epithet. (TA.)
إِبَاطِىٌّ: see what next precedes.
تَأَبَّطِىٌّ: see 5.
