ابق1
أَبَقَ, aor.
اَبِقَ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K, &c.,) which
is the most common form, (Msb,) and
اَبُقَ, (S, TS,
Mgh, Msb,) and
اَبَقَ, (K,) so in the copies of the
K in the place of
اَبُقَ; (TA;) and أَبِقَ, aor.
اَبَقَ;
(IDrd, Msb, K;) inf. n. إِبَاقٌ (S, Mgh, Msb)
and أَبْقٌ and أَبَقٌ, (K,) or the first of these is a
simple subst., and the second and third are the
inf. ns.; (Msb;) He (a slave) ran away, or fled,
(T, S, Mgh, Msb,) or went away, (K,) from his
master, (T, Msb,) without [being induced to do
so by] fear, or severity of work: (Msb, K:)
thus the signification is restricted in the 'Eyn:
(Msb:) and in this case, the law ordains that the
slave shall be restored; but if the act arise from
severity of work or from fear, he is not to be
restored: (Lth, TA:) in the Kur xxxvii. 140, it
is said of Jonas, (T, Bd,) because he fled from his
people without the permission of his Lord: (Bd:)
and it is also, tropically, said of a fish: (Mgh:)
or he (a slave) hid himself, and then went away:
(M, K:) as also ↓ تأبّق: (M:) or this signifies,
simply, he hid, or concealed, himself: or he confined, restricted, limited, restrained, or withheld,
himself: (S, K:) or it has both of the last two
significations: (Sgh:) and he abstained from a
thing, as from a sin, or crime. (IAar, K *.)
A poet says, (S,) namely, 'Ámir Ibn—Kaab,
(AZ,) or 'Ámán Ibn-Kaab, or, as some say,
Ghámán, (AA,)
↓ أَلَا قَالَتْ بَهَانِ وَ لَمْ تَأَبَّقْ
كَبِرْتَ وَلَا يَلِيقُ بِكَ النَّعِيمُ
[Now surely Baháni said, and she did not hide
herself, or did not restrain herself, Thou hast
grown old, and enjoyment doth not befit thee]:
(S:) or she did not hide herself [or her mind],
but said openly: (TA:) or she did not go far
[from the person whom she addressed, or from
the truth]; so says AZ, taking it from إِبَاقٌ as
relating to a slave: (TA:) or she did not abstain
from her speech, as from a sin, or crime: (IAar:)
or she did not disdain, or scorn. (TA.) AHát
says that he asked As respecting ↓تأبّق, and he
answered that he knew it not. (TA.)

camel) withheld her milk. (TA.) ―
-b3-  تأبّق الشَّىْءَ
[or مِنَ الشَّىْءِ] He denied, or disacknowledged, the

is such a quality; “ and he replies, مَا أَتَأَبَّقُ I do
not deny, or disacknowledge: and one says, “O
son of such a woman; ” and the man replies,
مَا أَتَأَبَّقُ مِنْهَا I do not deny, or disacknowledge,
her. (IF.)
