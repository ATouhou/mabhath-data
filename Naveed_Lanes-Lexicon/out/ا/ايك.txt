أَيِكَ الأَرَاكُ, aor.
اَيَكَ, The [trees called] اراك
became what is termed أَيْكَة [n. un. of أَيْكٌ, q. v.];
as also ↓ استأيك. (K.) The former occurs in
poetry contracted into أَيْكَ. (ISd, Sgh.)

إِسْتَاْيَكَ see 1.
أَيْكٌ Numerous, luxuriant or tangled or dense,
trees: (S, K:) or a place where water collects
and sinks into the ground (غَيْضَةٌ) producing
[trees of the kinds called] سِدْر and أَرَاك (Lth, K)
and similar soft trees: (Lth:) or a collection of
any trees; even, of palm-trees: (K:) or, as some
say, a place where [trees of the kind called] أَثْل
grow, and where is a collection of them: or,
accord. to AHn, an abundant collection of أَرَاك
in one place: (TA:) or trees; said to be of the
[kind called] أَرَاك: (Msb:) n. un. with ة: (S,
Msb, K, &c.:) IAar says, [you say,] أَيْكَةٌ
أَثْلٍ and رَهْطٌ, and قَصِيمَةٌ. (Sh.)
أَصْحَابُ الْأَيْكَةِ occurs in the Kur in four chapters:
[xv. 78 and xxvi. 176 and xxxviii. 12 and 1.13:]
(Sgh:) he who reads thus means, by the latter
word, الغَيْضَة [explained above, and also signifying the thicket, or collection of tangled trees,
&c.]; (S, K;) or the tangled, or luxuriant, or
abundant and dense, trees: (TA:) another reading is لَيْكَةَ; accord. to which, this is the name
of the town [in which the people here mentioned
dwelt]: (S, K:) or, as some say, the two words
are [applied to the same place,] like بَكَّةُ and مَكَّةُ:
(S:) but Zj says that another reading is allowable, and very good; i. e. أَصْحَابُ لَيْكَةِ, as being
originally الأيْكَةِ; for the Arabs say, اَلَحْمَرُ قَدْ
جَآءَنِى and لَحْمَرُ جَآإَنِى for الأَحْمَرُ; so that لَيْكَة
is like لَحْمَر. (TA.)
أَيْكٌ أَيِكٌ, (K, TA,) like كَتِفْ, (TA, [agreeably
with the verb, but in the CK اٰيِكٌ,]) is a phrase
in which the latter word signifies مُثْمِرٌ [Putting
forth fruit; &c.]: (K, TA:) or, as some say,
it is an intensive epithet [signifying very abundant
or luxuriant or tangled &c.]. (M, TA.)
