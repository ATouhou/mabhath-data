dropped off, one after another, (S, K, TA,) in
consequence of his being affected by the disease
termed جُذَام: (TA:) and it (said of a member,

says that من in this phrase is a mistranscription,
(TA,) means, May the members [or fingers] of
thy hands, or arms, drop off: (S, K, TA:) or it
means, may what is in thy hands depart from
thee, so that thou shalt be in want: occurring in
a trad. (IAar, T, TA.) And أَرِبَ مَا لَهُ, said by

means, accord. to Kt, May his members, or limbs,
drop off, or be cut off: what aileth him? (TA:)
or, accord. to IAar, may he become in want: what
aileth him? (T, TA:) but IAth says that this
has been related in three different ways: first,
أَرِبَ, signifying an imprecation, [as rendered
above,] and used as expressive of wonder: secondly, مَّا لَهُ ↓ أَرَبٌ; i. e. حَاجَةٌ لَهُ; مَا being
[syntactically] redundant, denoting littleness; the
meaning being, he has some little want: or, as
some say, a want hath brought him: what aileth
him? thirdly, ↓ أَرِبٌ; i. e. هُوَ أَرِبٌ; meaning he
is intelligent, or sagacious, or skilful, [as is said in
the T,] and perfect: what aileth him? or what
is his affair? the inchoative being suppressed.
(TA.) مَا لَهُ أَرِبَتْ يَدُهُ, (M, K, *) another form of
imprecation, (M,) means What aileth him? may
his arm, or hand, be cut off: or, may he become
poor, and want what is in the hands of others.
(M, K. *) ―
-b3-  [Hence, perhaps,] أَرِبَتْ مَعِدَتُهُ His
stomach became vitiated, disordered, or in an
