which I think the first word to be a mistranscription, for جِئْتُمُونِى, and the literal meaning to be,
Ye have come to me; but behind the hill is what
is behind it]: related on the authority of Zeyd
Ibn-Kethweh. (TA.) And one says, لَا تَبُلْ عَلَى
أَكَمةٍ, meaning (tropical:)  Publish not what is secret of
