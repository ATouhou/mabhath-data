pleased, or being pleased. (M, K.) It is said in
a trad., (T,) مَا أَذِنَ اللّٰهِ لِشَىْءٍ لِنَبِىٍّ يَتَغَنَّى
بالقُرآنِ (T, S) God hath not listened to anything
[in a manner] like his listening [to a prophet
chanting the Kur-án]. (T.) And in the Kur
[lxxxiv. 2 and 5], وَأَذِنَتْ لِرَبِّها And shall listen
to its Lord, (M, Bd, Jel,) and obey; (Jel;) i. e.,
shall submit to the influence of his power as one
listens to the commander and submits to him.
(Bd.) And you say, أَذِنَ لِلَّهْوِ He listened and
inclined to sport, or play. (M.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,
perhaps,] أَذِنَ لِرَائِحَةِ الطَّعَامِ (assumed tropical:)  He desired eagerly,
or longed for, the food, [perceiving its odour,]
(ISh, K,) and inclined to it. (ISh, TA.) ―
-b3-
[Hence also, app.,] أَذِنَ لَهُ فِى الشَّىء, (S, M, K,)
or فِى أَمْرِ كَذَا, (T,) or فِى كَذَا, (Msb,) aor.
اَذَنَ,
(T, K,) inf. n. إِذْنٌ, (T, S, M, K,) or this is a
simple subst., (Msb,) and أَذِينٌ, (K,) [as though
originally signifying He gave ear to him in

عَلَى الأَمِيرِ (S, TA) Take thou, or get thou,
permission for me from the commander, or
governor, or prince. (TA.) El-A'azz Ibn-'AbdAllah says,
وَ إِنِّى إِذَا ضَنَّ الأَمِيرُ بإِذْنِهِ
عَلَي الإِذنِ مِنْ نَفْسِى إِذا شِئْتٌ قَادِرٌ
[And verily I, when the prince is niggardly of
his permission, am able to take permission of
myself when I will]. (TA.) And a poet says,
قُلْتُ لِبَوَّابٍ لَدَيْهِ دَارُهَا

[I said to a door-keeper, near by whom was
her house, take thou, or get thou, permission for
me to enter, for I am her husband's father, and
her neighbour]: meaning, says Aboo-Jaafar,
لِتَأْذَنْ; for the suppression of the ل is allowable
in poetry, and the pronunciation with kesr to the
ت is accord. to the dial. of him who says أَنْتَ
تِعْلَمُ. (S.) ―
-b5-  أَذِنَ بِالشَّىءِ, (S, * M, Msb, K,)
aor.
اَذَنَ, (S, M, K,) inf. n. إِذْنٌ and أَذَنٌ and أَذَانٌ

(S, M, K) Then be ye informed, or apprized,

or hurt, his ear; (T, S, M, K;) or struck his
ear; (so in some copies of the S;) and ↓ آذَنَهُ
signifies the same, (M, K,) inf. n. إِيذَانٌ. (TA.)
[See also 2.] ―
-b2-  أُذِنَ [as though originally signifying He had his ear hit or hurt;] he complained,
or had a complaint, of his ear; (K;) said of
a man. (TA.)
2
أذّنهُ, (S, M, K,) inf. n. تَأْذِينٌ, (K,) He
wrung, or twisted, (عَرَكَ,) his (a boy's, S) ear:
(S, K:) or he struck, (ضَرَبَ, TA,) or struck with
his finger, or fillipped, (نَقَرَ, M, TA,) his ear.
(M, TA.) [See also أَذَنَهُ.] They say, (in a prov.,
TA in art. جوز,) لِكُلِّ جَابِهٍ جَوْزَةٌ ثُمَّ يُؤْذَّنُ, (M,
TA,) i. e. For every one that comes to water is a
single watering for his family and his cattle;
then his ear is struck, to apprize him that he
has nothing more to receive from them: (TA
in the present art., and the like is said in the
same in art. جوز:) or, (assumed tropical:)  then he is repelled from
the water: (TA in art. جوز:) [for أذّنهُ signifies
also] ―
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  He repelled him, (IAar, T, M, K,)
namely, a man, (IAar, T, M,) from drinking,
(K,) and did not give him to drink. (M, K.)
You say also, أَذِّنُوا عَنِّى أُوَلَهَا, [in which the
pronoun appears, from the context, to relate to
camels,] (assumed tropical:)  Send ye away from me the first ones
of them. (En-Nadr, T.)
-A2-  أذّن النَّعْلَ, (inf. n.
as above, S,) He put to the sandal what is termed
أُذُنٌ, q. v. infrà: (S, M, K:) and in like manner
one says with respect to other things. (S, K.)
-A3-
أذّن, (M, K,) inf. n. as above, (K,) also signifies He made known, or notified, a thing (بِشَىْءٍ)
much; (M, K; *) he proclaimed, or made proclamation; syn. نَادَى: (Jel in vii. 42, and
Bd and Jel in xii. 70 and xxii. 28:) Sb
says that some of the Arabs make أَذَّنَ and
↓ آذَنَ to be syn.: but some say that the former
signifies he called out publickly; and the latter,
i. q. أَعْلَمَ [he made to know, &c.: see 4]. (M,
TA.) It is said in the Kur [xxii. 28], وَأَذِّنْ فِى
النَّاسِ بِالحَجِّ (M) And proclaim thou, among the
people, the pilgrimage. (Bd, Jel.) ―
-b2-  Also, (S,
K,) or أذّن بِالصَّلَاةِ, (Msb,) inf. n. as above, (M,
K,) or أَذَانٌ, (S,) or both, (TA,) or the latter
is [properly speaking] a simple subst. [used as
an inf. n.], as in the instances of وَدَّعَ وَدَاعَّا and
سَلَّمَ سَلَامًا and كَلَّمَ كَلَامًا &c., (Msb,) He
called to prayer; (M, K;) he notified, or made
known, or proclaimed, [i. e., chanted, from the
مِئْذَنَة,] the time of prayer; (S, * Msb, * TA;)
and ↓ آذَنَ signifies the same, (K,) inf. n. إِيذَانٌ.
(TA.) IB says, the phrase أَذَّنَ العَصْرُ, with the
verb in the act. form, [a phrase commonly obtaining in the present day,] is wrong; the correct
expression being أُذِّنَ بِالعَصْرِ [The time of the
prayer of afternoon was proclaimed, i. e., chanted],
with the verb in the pass. form, and with the
preposition to connect it with its subject. (Msb.)
―
-b3-  You say also, أَذَّنَ بِإِرْسَالِ إِبِلِهِ He spoke of
sending away his camels. (En-Nadr, T.)
4
آذنهُ: see 1, last sentence but one. ―
-b2-  [Hence,
app.,] inf. n. إِيذَانٌ, (assumed tropical:)  He prevented him, or forbade him; (K;) and repelled him. (TA.) [See
also 2.] ―
-b3-  And (assumed tropical:)  It (a thing, M) pleased, or
rejoiced, him, (M, K,) and he therefore listened
to it. (M.)
-A2-  آذَنْتُهُ, inf. n. إِيذَانٌ, (T, Msb,) in
the place of which the subst. أَذَانٌ is also used,
(T,) signifies أَعْلَمْتُهُ [I made him to know, or
have knowledge; informed, apprized, advertised,
or advised, him; gave him information, intelligence, notice, or advice: and I made it known,
notified it, or announced it]: (T, Msb:) and
↓ تَأَذَّنْتُ, also, signifies أَعْلَمْتُ [as meaning I made
to know, &c.: and I made known, &c.]. (Msb.)
You say, آذنهُ بِالأَمْرِ, (T, K, [in the CK, erroneously, اَذَنَهُ,]) or بِالشَّىْءِ, (S,) and آذنهُ الأَمْرَ, (M,
K,) inf. n. إِيذَانٌ, (T,) meaning أَعْلَمَهُ [He made
him to know, or have knowledge of, the thing;
informed, apprized, advertised, or advised, him of
it; gave him information, intelligence, notice, or
advice, of it; made it known, notified it, or
announced it, to him]; (T, S, M, K;) as also
الأَمْرَ ↓ تأذّنهُ. (M.) So, accord. to one reading,
in the Kur [ii. 279], فَآذِنُوا بِحَرْبٍ مِنَ اللّٰهِ Then
make ye known, or notify ye, or announce ye, war
from God. (M. [For the more common reading,
see 1, latter part.]) And so in the Kur [vii. 166],
رَبُّكَ ↓ وَ إِذْ تَأَذَّنَ And when thy Lord made known,
or notified, or announced: (Zj, S, M, K: *) or
the meaning here is, swore: (M, K: *) [for] you
say, لَيَفْعَدَنَ ↓ تَأَذَّنَ, meaning he swore that he
would assuredly do [such a thing]: (M:) Lth
says that لَأَ فْعَلَنَّ كَذَا وَ كَذَا ↓ تَأَذَّنْتُ signifies the
making the action obligatory. (T.) You say also,
الأَمِيرُ فِى النَّاسِ ↓ تَأَذَّنَ The commander, or governor, or prince, proclaimed (نَادَى) among the
people, with threatening (S, K) and prohibition;
i. e. تَقَدَّمَ and أَعْلَمَ. (S.) And you say of a
building that has cracked in its sides, آذَنَ بِالِانْهِدَامِ
وَالسُّقُوطِ (assumed tropical:)  [It gave notice of becoming a ruin
and of falling down]. (Msb in art. دعو.) [See
also a similar ex. in a verse cited voce أَلَا. And
hence,] آذَنَ العُشْبُ [in the CK (erroneously) اَذَنَ]
(tropical:)  The herbage began to dry up; part of it being
still succulent, and part already dried up. (M,
K, TA.) And آذَنَ الحُبُّ The grain put forth
its أَذَنَة, or leaves. (TA.) See also 2, latter half,
in two places.
-A3-  آذَنَ and ↓ تأذّن are [also] used
in one and the same sense [as meaning He knew;
had knowledge; or became informed, apprized,
advertised, or advised, of a thing]; like as one
says أَيْقَنَ and تَيَقَّنَ. (S, TA.) You say, ↓ تَأَذَّنْ,
meaning اِعْلَمْ [Know thou]; like as you say
تَعَلَّمْ, meaning اِعْلَمْ. (M.)
5
تَاَذَّنَ see 4, in eight places.
10
استأذنهُ He asked, or demanded, of him
permission, or leave, (M, Msb, K,) فِى كَذَا to
do such a thing. (Msb.) [You say, استأذن meaning He asked, or demanded, permission, or leave,
to enter, or to come into the presence of another;
and to go. And استأذن فِى الدُّخُولِ عليه, and,
elliptically, استأذن عليه, He asked, or demanded,
permission, or leave, to go in to him.]
أُذْنٌ: see أُذُنٌ.
إِذْنٌ [is held by some to be an inf. n., like
↓ أَذَيِنٌ: (see 1:) by others, to be] a simple subst.;
(Msb;) signifying Permission; leave; or concession of liberty, to do a thing: and sometimes
command: and likewise will; (Msb, TA;) as in
the phrase بِإِذْنِ اللّٰهِ by the will of God: (Msb:)
or, accord. to El-Harállee, the withdrawal, or
removal, of prevention or prohibition, and the
giving of power or ability, in respect of being
and creation: or, accord. to Ibn-El-Kemál, the
rescission of prohibition, and concession of freedom of action, to him who has been prohibited by
law: or, accord. to Er-Rághib, the notification
of the allowance or permission of a thing, and of
indulgence in respect of it; as in إِلَّا لِيُطَاعَ بِإِذْنِ
اللّٰهِ, [in the Kur iv. 67,] meaning [but that he
may be obeyed] by the will of God, and [also]
by his command: (TA:) or, as explained in the
Ksh, facilitation; an explanation founded upon
the opinion that the actions of men are by their
own effective power, but facilitated by God; and
in this sense, Esh-Shiháb regards it as a metaphor,
or a non-metaphorical trope: (MF:) and accommodation; syn. تَوْفِيقٌ; (Hr in explanation of a
clause of iii. 139 of the Kur [which see below];)
but Es-Semeen says that this requires consideration. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also Knowledge; syn. عِلْمٌ;
(T, M, K;) and so ↓ أَذِينٌ; (M, K;) as in the
saying فَعَلَهُ بِإِذْنِى (T, * M, K) and ↓ بِأَذِينى (M,
K) [He did it with my knowledge]: or إِذْنٌ has a
more particular signification than عِلْمٌ, being
scarcely ever, or never, used save of that [knowledge] wherein is will, conjoined with command or
not conjoined therewith; for in the saying [in the
Kur iii. 139, referred to above,] وَمَا كَانَ لِنَفْسٍ
أَنْ تَمُوتَ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِ اللّٰهِ [And it is not for a soul to
die save with the knowledge of God], it is known
that there are will and command; and in the
saying [in the Kur ii. 96], وَمَا هُمْ بِضَّارِينَ بِهِ مِنْ
أَحَدٍ إِلَّا بإِذْنِ اللّٰهِ [But they do not injure thereby
any one save with the knowledge of God], there is
will in one respect, for there is no difference of
opinion as to the fact that God hath made to exist
in man a faculty wherein is the power of injuring
another: (Er-Rághib:) but Es-Semeen says that
this plea is adduced by Er-Rághib because of his
inclining to the persuasion of the Moatezileh.
(TA.) You say also, فَعَلْتُ كَذَا بِإِذْنِهِ meaning
I did thus by his command. (T.)
أَذَنٌ: see أَذَنَةٌ
أُذُنٌ and ↓ أُذْنٌ, (S, M, Msb, K,) the latter a
contraction of the former, [which is the more
common,] (Msb,) [The ear;] one of the organs
of sense; (M, TA;) well known: (M:) of the
fem. gender: (S, M, Msb, K:) as also ↓ أَذِينٌ:
(K:) pl. آذَانٌ, (S, M, Msb, K,) its only pl. form:
(M:) dim. ↓ أُذَيْنَةٌ; but when used as a proper
name of a man, أُذَيْنُ, though أُذَيْنَةُ has been
heard. (S.) You say, جَآءَ نَاشِرَّا أُذُنَيْهِ [He came
spreading, or, as we say, pricking up, his ears:
meaning] (tropical:)  he came in a state of covetousness, or
eagerness. (T, K, TA. [See also نَشَرَ.]) And
وَجَدْتُ فُلَانًا لَا بِسًا أُذُنَيْهِ (tropical:)  I found such a one
feigning himself inattentive, or heedless. (T, TA.)
And لَبِسْتُ أُذُنَىَّ لَهُ (tropical:)  I turned away from him,
avoided him, or shunned him: or I feigned myself
inattentive, or heedless, to him. (K, TA. [See
also لَبِسَ.]) ―
-b2-  (tropical:)  A man who listens to what is said
to him: (M, K, TA:) or a man who hears the
speech of every one: (S:) or who relies upon
what is said to him; as also وَابِصَةُ السَّمْعِ: (M in
art. وبص:) applied as an epithet to one and to a
pl. number, (S, M, K,) alike, (S, M,) and to two,
and to a woman; not being pluralized nor dualized
[nor having the fem. form given to it]: (IB:)
you say رَجُلٌ أٌذْنٌ (AZ, S, M) and أُذْنٌ, and
رِجَالٌ أُذُنٌ and أُذْنٌ [&c.]: (AZ, M:) and sometimes it is applied to a man as a name of evil
import. (M.) It is said in the Kur [ix. 61],
وَيَقُولُونَ هُوَ أُذُنٌ قُلْ أُذُنُ خَيْرٍ لَكُمْ (T, M) And
they say, “He is one who hears and believes
everything that is said to him:” as though, by
reason of the excess of his listening, he were
altogether the organ of hearing; like as a spy is
termed عَيْنٌ; or أُذُن is here from أَذِنَ “he listened,” and is like أُنُفٌ and شُلُلٌ in its derivation:
(Bd:) for among the hypocrites was he who
found fault with the Prophet, saying, “If anything be told him from me, I swear to him, and
he receives it from me, because he is an أُذُن:” (M:)
therefore he is commanded to answer, Say, “A
hearer of good for you.” (T, M, Bd.) ―

feathers] meaning an arrow: all so called by
way of comparison: (M:) and (assumed tropical:)  of a sandal; (S,

قِبَال [q. v.]: (M:) or أُذُنَا النَّعْلِ signifies the two
parts, [or loops,] of the sandal, to which are tied
the عَضُدَانِ of the شِرَاك, [or two branches of the
thong that is attached to another thong between
two of the toes, which two branches, however,
sometimes pass through the أُذُنَانِ, encompassing
the heel,] behind the narrow part (خَصْر) of the
sole. (AO in an anonymous MS in my possession.
See also خَصْرٌ.) ―
-b5-  (tropical:)  A handle, (M,) or [a loopshaped, or an ear-shaped, handle, such as is
termed] عُرْوَة, (T, K,) of anything; (M, K) as,

feel a strong appetite &c. (En-Nadr, T.) And
هٰذَا طَعَامٌ لَا أَذَنَةَ لَهُ This is food for the odour of
which there is no appetite. (K, * TA.)
أَذَانٌ A making known; a notification; an
announcement. (T, S, Mgh.) [See 4.] So in
the Kur [ix. 3], وَ أَذَانٌ مِنَ اللّٰهِ وَرَسُولِهِ إِلَى النَّاسِ

God and his apostle to men, or the people]. (T,
Mgh.) ―

of the time thereof; (T, S;) the call to prayer.
(M, K.) [The words of this call (which is
usually chanted from the مِئْذَنَة, or turret of the
mosque,) are اَللّٰهُ أَكْبَرْ (four times) أَشْهَدُ أنْ لَا إِلٰهَ
إِلَّا اللّٰهْ (twice) أَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا رَّسُولُ اللّٰهُ (twice)
حَيَّ عَلَى الصَّلَاهٌ (twice) حَىَّ عَلَى الفَلَاحْ (twice)

to be present at the performance of the divinelyordained prayers. (TA.) [This (which is chanted

thing; and perhaps also بِغَيْرِهِ for another person;]
syn. كَفِيلٌ (S, M, K) and زَعِيمٌ [which signifies
the same as كَفِيلٌ, and is plainly shown in the
M to be here used as a syn. of this latter; but
SM assigns to it here another meaning, namely
رَئِيسٌ, in which sense I find no instance of the
use of أَذِينٌ]; (AO, M;) and ↓ آذِنٌ also is syn.
