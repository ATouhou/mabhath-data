it pleasant or delightful, delighted in it, or took

it. (TA.) And تأنّق المَكَانَ He was pleased, or
rejoiced, with the place, and attached to it, not
quitting it: (L:) he loved the place. (Fr, K.)
It is said in a trad. of Ibn-Mes'ood, إِذَا وَقَعْتُ فِى
آلِ حم وَقَعْتُ فِي رَوْضَاتٍ أَتَأَنَّقُهُنَّ, or, as in the T,
أَتَأَنَّقُ فِيهِنَّ, meaning [When I find myself in the

plenty]. (JK.) ―

أَنِقٌ: see أَنِيقٌ.
مَا لَهُ فِى الشَّىْءِ أَنِقَةٌ He has no pleasure, or
pride, in the thing. (JK.)
أَنُوقٌ A certain bird; (S;) i. e. the رَخَمَة [or
female of the vultur percnopterus]; (IAar, S;)
called by Kumeyt ذَاتُ اسْمَيْنِ [possessor of two
names] because having these two appellations:
(S:) or the eagle: and also the former bird:
(K:) ISk cites 'Omárah as saying that it is in
his opinion the eagle; but that people say it is the
رخمة; and he adds, [alluding to a prov., which
see below,] that the eggs of the رخمة are found in
ruins, and in plain country: (TA:) or the male
of the رَخَم: (JK, TA:) or a certain black bird,
having what resembles the عُرْف [or comb of the
cock], (AA, K,) that deposits its eggs in remote
places: (AA:) or a certain black bird, (AA, K,)
like a great hen, (AA,) bald in the fore part of
the head, (AA, K,) having a yellow bill, (K,) or
having a long bill: (AA:) she guards her eggs,
and defends her young one, and keeps with her
offspring, and submits not herself to any but her
mate, and migrates among the first of the migrating
birds, and returns among the first of the returning
birds, and will not fly while moulting, and will
not be deceived by her small feathers but waits
until they become quills and then flies, and will
not remain constantly in the nests, and will not
alight upon the quiver (K) knowing it to contain
arrows: (TA:) the word is sing. and pl.: (TA:)
or its pl. is أُنُقٌ. (JK.) Hence the prov., (JK,
S,) أَعَزُّ مِنْ بَيْضِ الأَنُوقِ [More rare than the eggs
of the anook]: (JK, S, K:) because this bird
guards its eggs, so that they are hardly ever, or
never, found; for its nests are on the tops of
mountains, and in difficult and distant places; (S,
K;) notwithstanding which, it is said to be stupid:
(S:) ISd says that the female bird called رخمة
may be meant thereby; or the male, because the
eggs of the male exist not; or the eggs of the
latter may be meant because he often guards
them, like as does the male ostrich. (TA.)
أَنِيقٌ Goodly, or beautiful; (S, K;) pleasing,
or rejoicing; (JK, S, Msb, K;) as also ↓ أَنَقٌ:
(JK, TA:) and loved. (TA.) You say, رَوْضَةٌ أَنِيقٌ
A meadow, or garden, that is loved: and رَوْضَةٌ
أَنِيقَةٌ a meadow, or garden, that is pleasing, or
rejoicing. (TA.)
لَهُ إِنَاقَةٌ and أَنَاقَةٌ (K, and so in some copies of
the S,) He has goodliness, or beauty, and pleasingness: but in the L, [and in some copies of the S,]
لَهُ إِنَاقَةٌ وَلَبَاقةٌ; and what precedes it indicates that
the meaning is he has a faculty of doing well or
excellently [and of nice or refined skilfulness].
(TA.)
آنَقُ [originally أأْنَقُ] More, or most, pleasing
or rejoicing. (TA.)
مُتَأَنِّقٌ [part. n. of 5; Seeking, pursuing, or
desiring, the most pleasing of things; affecting
nicety, or refinement; dainty, nice, exquisite,
refined, &c.; in respect of food, apparel, speech,
&c.:] one who is in a pleasing condition (فِى أَنَقٍ)
in respect of his life, and in a state of plenty.
(JK.) It is said in a prov., لَيْسَ المُتَعَلِّقُ كَالمُتَأَنِّقِ,
(JK, TA,) i. e. He who is content with what is
little, (S, K, in art. علق,) or what is barely sufficient, of sustenance, (TA in the present art.,) is
not like him who seeks, pursues, or desires, the
most pleasing of things, or who is dainty, &c.,
(مَنْ يَتَأَنَّقُ,) and eats what he pleases, (S, K, in
art. علق,) or him who is not content save with the
most pleasing of things. (TA in the present art.)
