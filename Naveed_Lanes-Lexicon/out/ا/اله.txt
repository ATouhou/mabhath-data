أَلَهَ, (S, and so in some copies of the K,) with
fet-h, (S,) or أَلِهَ, (Mgh, Msb, and so in some
copies of the K,) like تَعِبَ, aor.
اَلَهَ, (Msb,) inf. n.
إِلَاهَةٌ (S, Msb, K) and أُلُوهَةٌ and أُلُوهِيَّپٌ, (K,) He
served, worshipped, or adored; syn. عَبَدَ. (S,
Msb, K.) Hence the reading of I'Ab, [in the
Kur vii. 124,] وَيَذَرَكَ وَإِلَاهَتَكَ [And leave thee,
and the service, or worship, or adoration, of thee;
instead of وَآلِهَتَكَ and thy gods, which is the common reading]; for he used to say that Pharaoh
was worshipped, and did not worship: (S:) so,
too, says, Th: and IB says that the opinion of
I'Ab is strengthened by the sayings of Pharaoh
[mentioned in the Kur lxxix. 24 and xxviii. 38],
“I am your lord the most high,” and “I did not
know any god of yours beside me.” (TA.)
-A2-
أَلِهَ, aor.
اَلَهَ, (S, K,) inf. n. أَلَهٌ, (S,) He was, or
became, confounded, or perplexed, and unable to
see his right course; (S, K;) originally وَلِهَ. (S.)
―
-b2-  أَلِهَ عَلَي فُلَانٍ He was, or became, vehemently
impatient, or affected with vehement grief, or he
manifested vehement grief and agitation, on account of such a one; (S, K;) like وَلِهَ. (S.) ―
-b3-
أَلِهَ إِلَيْهِ He betook himself to him by reason of
fright or fear, seeking protection; or sought, or
asked, aid, or succour, of him: he had recourse,
or betook himself, to him for refuge, protection,
or preservation. (K.) ―
-b4-  أَلِهَ بِالمَكَانِ He remained,
stayed, abode, or dwelt, in the place. (MF.)
-A3-
أَلَهَهُ, (K,) like مَنَعَهُ, (TA,) [in the CK اَلِهَهُ,] He
protected him; granted him refuge; preserved,
saved, rescued, or liberated, him; aided, or succoured, him; or delivered him from evil: he
rendered him secure, or safe. (K.)

تَأْلِيهٌ [inf. n. of أَلَّهَهُ He made him, or took
him as, a slave; he enslaved him;] i. q. تَعْبِيدٌ.
(S, K.) ―
-b2-  [The primary signification of أَلَّهَهُ seems
to be, He made him to serve, worship, or adore.
―
-b3-  Accord. to Freytag, besides having the former
of the two meanings explained above, it signifies
He reckoned him among gods; held him to be a
god; made him a god: but he does not mention
his authority.]
5
تألّه He devoted himself to religious services
or exercises; applied himself to acts of devotion.
(JK, S, Msb, K.)
أُلْهَانِيَّةٌ: see إِلَاهَةٌ.
إِلهٌ, or إِلَاهٌ, [the former of which is the more
common mode of writing the word,] is of the
measure فعَالٌ (S, Msb, K) in the sense of the
measure مَفْعُولٌ, (S, Msb,) like كِتَابٌ in the sense
of مَكْتُوبٌ, and بِسَاطٌ in the sense of مَبْسُوطً,
(Msb,) meaning ↓ مَأْلْوةٌ [An object of worship or
adoration; i. e. a god, a deity]; (S, Msb, K)
anything that is taken as an object of worship or
adoration, accord. to him who takes it as such:
(K:) with the article ال, properly, i. q. اللّٰهُ; [sec
this word below;] but applied by the believers in
a plurality of gods to what is worshipped by them
to the exclusion of اللّٰه: (Msb:) pl. آلِهَةٌ: (Msb,
TA:) which signifies idols: (JK, S, TA:) in
the K, this meaning is erroneously assigned to
إِلَاهَةٌ: (TA:) [not so in the CK; but there,
الالِهَةُ is put in a place where we should read
الإِلَاهَةُ, or إِلَاهَةُ without the article:] ↓ الإِلَاهَةُ [is
the fem. of الإِلَاهُ, and] signifies [the goddess: and
particularly] the serpent: [(a meaning erroneously
assigned in the CK to الآلِهَةُ; as also other meanings here following:) because it was a special
object of the worship of some of the ancient
Arabs:] (K:) or the great serpent: (Th:) and
the [new moon; or the moon when it is termed]
هِلَال: (Th, K:) and, (S, K,) as also ↓ إِلَاهَةُ,
without ال, the former perfectly decl., and the
latter imperfectly decl., (S,) and ↓ الأُلَاهَةُ, (IAar,
K,) and ↓ أُلَاهَةُ, (IAar, TA,) and ↓ الأَلَاهَةُ, (K,)
[and app. ↓ أَلَاهَةُ,] and ↓ الأَلِيهَةُ, (K,) the sun; (S,
K;) app. so called because of the honour and worship which they paid to it: (S:) or the hot sun. (Th,
TA.) [إِلهٌ is the same as the Hebrew
אֱלוֹהַּ and
The Chaldee
XXX; and is of uncertain derivaTion: accord. To some,] it is originally وِلَاهٌ, like
as إِشَاحٌ is originally وِشَاحٌ; meaning that mankind yearn towards him who is thus called,
[seeking protection or aid,] in their wants, and
humble themselves to him in their afflictions, like
as every infant yearns towards its mother. (TA.)

إِلَاهَةٌ inf. n. of 1, q. v. (S, Msb, K.)

[
إِلهِىٌّ, or إِلَاهِىٌّ, Of, or relating to, God or a
god; divine; theological: Hence, العِلْمُ الإِلهِىُّ
or الإِلَاهِىٌّ: see what next follows.]
[
الإِلهِيَّةُ, or الإِلَاهِيَّةُ, Theology; the science of
the being and attributes of God, and of the
articles of religious belief; also termed عِلْمُ الإِلهِيَّاتِ
or الإِلَاهِيَّاتِ, and ↓ العِلْمُ الإِلهِىُّ or الإِلَاهِىُّ.]
اللّٰهُ, [written with the disjunctive alif اَللّٰهُ,
meaning God, i. e. the only true god,] accord. to
the most correct of the opinions respecting it,
which are twenty in number, (K,) or more than
thirty, (MF,) is a proper name, (Msb, K,) applied
to the Being who exists necessarily, by Himself,
comprising all the attributes of perfection; (TA;)
a proper name denoting the true god, comprising
all the excellent divine names; a unity comprising
all the essences of existing things; (Ibn-El-
'Arabee, TA;) the ال being inseparable from it:
(Msb:) not derived: (Lth, Msb, K:) or it is
originally إِلهٌ, or إِلَاهٌ, (Sb, A Heyth, S, Msb, K,)
of the measure فِعَالٌ in the sense of the measure
مَفْعُولٌ, meaning مَأْلُوهٌ, (S, K, *) with [the article]
ال prefixed to it, (Sb, A Heyth, S, Msb,) so that
it becomes الإِلَاهُ, (Sb, A Heyth, Msb,) then the
vowel of the hemzeh is transferred to the ل [before
it], (Msb,) and the hemzeh is suppressed, (Sb,
A Heyth, S, Msb,) so that there remains اللّٰهُ, or
الِلَاهُ, after which the former ل is made quiescent,
and incorporated into the other: (Sb, A Heyth,
Msb:) the suppression of the hemzeh is for the
purpose of rendering the word easy of utterance,
on account of the frequency of its occurrence:
and the ال is not a substitute for the hemzeh; for
were it so, it would not occur therewith in الإِلَاهُ:
(S:) so says J; but IB says that this is not a
necessary inference, because الإِلَاهُ applies to God
(اللّٰهُ) and also to the idol that is worshipped;
whereas اللّٰهُ applies only to God; and therefore,
in using the vocative form of address, one may
say, يَا اَللّٰهُ [O God], with the article ال and with
the disjunctive hemzeh; but one may not say,
يَا الإِلَاهُ either with the disjunctive or with the
conjunctive hemzeh: (TA:) Sb allows that it
may be originally لَاهٌ: see art. ليه: (S:) some
say that it is from أَلِهَ, either because minds are
confounded, or perplexed, by the greatness, or
majesty, of God, or because He is the object of
recourse for protection, or aid, in every case: or
from أَلَهَهُ, meaning “he protected him,” &c., as
explained above: see 1, last sentence. (TA.) The
ال is pronounced with the disjunctive hemzeh in
using the vocative form of address [يَا اَللّٰهُ] because
it is inseparably prefixed as an honourable distinction of this name; (S;) or because a pause
upon the vocative particle is intended in honour
of the name; (S in art. ليه;) and AAF says that
it is also thus pronounced in a form of swearing;
as in أَفَاَللّٰهِ لَتَفْعَلَنَّ [an elliptical phrase, as will be
shown below, meaning Then, by God, wilt thou
indeed do such a thing?]; though he denies its
being thus pronounced because it is inseparable;
regarding it as a substitute for the suppressed
hemzeh of الإِلَاهُ: (S in the present art.:) Sb
mentions this pronunciation in يَا اَللّٰهُ; and Th
mentions the pronunciation of يَا اللّٰهُ also, with the
conjunctive hemzeh: Ks, moreover, mentions, as
used by the Arabs, the phrase يَلَهْ اَغْفِرْلِى [O
God, forgive me], for يَا اللّٰهُ; but this is disapproved. (ISd, TA.) The word is pronounced in
the manner termed تَفْخِيم, [i. e., with the broad
sound of the lengthened fet-h, and with a full
sound of the letter ل,] for the purpose of showing
honour to it; but when it is preceded by a kesreh,
[as in بِاللّٰهِ By God, and بِسْمِ اللّٰهِ In the name of
God,] it is pronounced in the [contr.] manner
termed تَرْقِيق: AHát says that some of the vulgar
say, لَاوَاللّٰهْ [No, by God], suppressing the alif,
which should necessarily be uttered, as in الرَّحْمنُ,
which is in like manner written without alif; and
he adds that some person has composed a verse
in which the alif [in this word] is suppressed,
erroneously. (Msb.) You say, اَللّٰهَ اللّٰهَ فِى كَذَا,
[a verb being understood,] meaning Fear ye
God, fear ye God, with respect to such a thing.
(Marginal note in a copy of the Jámi' es-Sagheer.
[See another ex. voce كَرَّةٌ.]) And اَللّٰهَ لَأَفْعَلَنَّ
and اَللّٰهِ لَأَفْعَلَنَّ [By God, I will assuredly do
such a thing]: in the former is understood a verb
significant of swearing; and in the latter, [or in
both, for a noun is often put in the accus. case
because of a particle understood,] a particle [such
as بِ or وَ] denoting an oath. (Bd in ii. 1.) And
لِلهِ مَا فَعَلْتُ, meaning وَاللّٰهِ مَا فَعَلْتُ [By God, I
did not, or have not done, such a thing]. (JK.)
And لِلّهِ دَرُّكَ (tropical:)  To God be attributed thy deed! (A
in art. در:) or the good that hath proceeded from
thee! or thy good deed! or thy gift! and what is
received from thee! [and thy flow of eloquence!
and the like]: a phrase expressive of admiration
of anything: (TA in art. در:) [when said to an
eloquent speaker or poet, it may be rendered
divinely art thou gifted!]. And لِلّهِ دَرُّهُ (tropical:)  To God be
attributed his deed! [&c.]. (S and K in art. در.)
And لِلّهِ القَائِلُ [meaning To God be attributed
(the eloquence of) the sayer! or] how good, or
beautiful, is the saying of the sayer, or of him
who says [such and such words]! or it is like the
phrase لِلّهِ دَرُّهُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  To God be attributed
his goodness! and his pure action! (Har p. 11.)
And لِلّهِ فُلَانٌ [To God be attributed (the excel-lence, or goodness, or deed, &c., of) such a one!]
explained by Az as meaning wonder ye at such a
one: how perfect is he! (Har ibid.) [And لِلّهِ أَبُوكَ:
see art. ابو.] And لَاهِ أَنْتَ, meaning لِلّهِ أَنْتَ [lit.
To God be thou attributed! i. e. to God be attributed thine excellence! or thy goodness! or thy
deed! &c.]. (JK.) [Similar to لِلّهِ, thus used, is
the Hebrew expression
לֵאלֹהּי� after an epithet
signifying “great” or the like.] إِنَّالِلّهِ وَإِنَّا إِلَيْهِ
رَاجِعُونَ, in the Kur [ii. 151], said on the occasion
of an affliction, means Verily to God we belong,
as property and servants, He doing with us what
He willeth, and verily unto Him we return in
the ultimate state of existence, and He will
recompense us. (Jel.) AZ mentions the phrase
الحَمْدُلَاهِ [meaning الحَمْدُلِلّهِ Praise be to God]:
but this is not allowable in the Kur-án: it is only
related as heard from the Arabs of the desert, and
those not knowing the usage of the Kur-án. (Az,
TA.) ―
-b2-  ↓ اَللّهُمَّ is an expression used in prayer;
as also لَاهُمَّ; (JK, Msb;) meaning يَا اَللّٰهُ [O
God]; the م being a substitute for [the suppressed
vocative particle] يا; (S in art. ليه, and Bd in
iii. 25;) but one says also, يَا اَللّهُمَّ, (JK, and S
ibid,) by poetic licence: (S ibid:) or the meaning,
accord. to some, is يَا اَللّٰهُ أُمَّنَا بِخَيْرٍ [O God, bring
us good]; (JK, and Bd ubi suprà;) and hence
the origin of the expression. (Bd.) You say also
اَللّهُمَّ إِلَّا [which may be rendered, inversely, Unless, indeed; or unless, possibly]: the former word
being thus used to denote that the exception is
something very rare. (Mtr in the commencement
of his Expos. of the Makámát of El-Hareeree,
and Har pp. 52 and 53.) And اَللّهُمَّ نَعَمْ [which
may be rendered, inversely, Yes, indeed; or yea,
verily]: the former word being used in this case
as corroborative of the answer to an interrogation,
negative and affirmative. (Har p. 563.)
