إِسْتَاْجَلَ see 2 and 5.
أَجْلٌ is originally the inf. n. of أَجَلَ شَرًّا “ he
committed evil; ” and is used to indicate the
causation of crimes; and afterwards, by extension
of its application, to indicate any causation: (Bd in
v. 35:) one says, فَعَلْتُهُ مِنْ أَجْلِكَ, and ↓ من إِجْلِكَ,
(S, K,) and فَعَلْتُهُ أَجْلَكَ, and ↓ إِجْلَكَ, (so in some
copies of the K,) and من أَجْلَالِكَ, and من إِجْلَالِكَ,
(K, [belonging to art. جلو, in which also they are
mentioned,]) and من أَجْلالِكَ, and من إِجْلَالِكَ,
(so in some copies of the K and in the TA, [belonging to art. جل,]) i. e. [I did it] مِنْ جَرَّاكَ,
(S,) which means [originally] in consequence of
thy committing it: (Bd ubi suprà:) [and then,
by extension of its application, as shown above,
because of thee, or of thine act &c.; on thine
account; for thy sake; as also لِأَجْلِكَ, which is
more common in the present day:] or منْ جَلَلِكَ:
(K:) and مِنْ أَجْلِهِ كَانَ كَذَا, i. e. بِسَبَبِهِ [Because
of him, or it, it was thus, or such a thing was].
(Msb.) An instance of its occurrence without
مِنْ [or لِ] is presented by the saying of 'Adee
Ibn-Zeyd,
أَجْلَ أَنَّ اللّٰهَ قَدْ فَضَّلَكُمْ
[Because that God hath made you to have excel-lence, or hath preferred you]. (TA.)
إِجْلٌ, whence فَعَلْتُهُ مِنْ إِجْلِكَ, and فَعَلْتُهُ إِجْلَكَ:
see أَجْلٌ, in two places.
أَجَلٌ, (S, Mughnee, K,) with the ل quiescent,
(Mughnee,) is written with kesr and with fet-h
[to the medial letter, i. e. ↓ أَجِلْ as well as أَجَلْ]
like نعم [which is written نَعِمٌ as well as نَعَمْ]:
(TA:) it is a particle (Mughnee) denoting a
reply; like نَعَمْ; (S, Mughnee, K;) importing
acknowledgment of the truth of the speaker, to
him who gives information; and the making a
thing known, to him who asks information; and
a promise, to him who seeks, or demands;
(Mughnee;) i. e. It is as thou sayest [in the first
case; and yes, or yea, in the same, and in the
other cases]; (K voce بَسَلٌ;) therefore it occurs
after such sayings as “ Zeyd stood ” and “ did
Zeyd stand? ” and “ beat thou Zeyd: ” but ElMálakee restricts the information to that which is
affirmative, and the saying expressive of seeking
or demanding to that which is without prohibition:
and it is said by some that it does not occur after
an interrogation: (Mughnee:) Er-Radee says, in
the Expos. of the Káfiyeh, after Z and others,
that it is to denote acknowledgment of the truth
of information, and does not occur after a saying
in which is the meaning of seeking, or demanding:
(TA:) or, accord. to Z and Ibn-Málik and others,
it relates particularly to information: and accord.
to Ibn-Kharoof, it occurs mostly after information:
(Mughnee:) in the Expos. of the Tes-heel, it is
said to be for denoting acknowledgment of the
truth of information, past or other, affirmative or
negative, and not to occur after an interrogation:
(TA:) Akh says that it is better than نَعَمْ (S,
Mughnee, K *) after information, (Mughnee,) in
acknowledging the truth of what is said; (S,
Mughnee, K;) and نعم is better than it after an
interrogation: (S, Mughnee, K:) so that when
one says, سَوْفَ تَذْهَبُ [Thou wilt, or shalt, go
away], thou sayest أَجَلْ [Yes]; and it is better
than نعم: but when one says, أَتَذْهَبُ [Wilt thou
go away?], thou sayest نعم; and it is better than
اجل. (S.)
أَجَلٌ The term, or period, of a thing: (S, K:)
its assigned, appointed, or specified, term or
period: this is the primary signification: (TA:)
or the term, or period, and time of falling due, of
a thing: (Msb:) pl. آجَالٌ. (Msb, K.) ―
-b2-  Hence,
The period of women's waiting, before they may
marry again, after divorce: as in the Kur ii. 231
and 232. (TA.) ―
-b3-  The period, or extremity of time,
in which falls due a debt (K, TA) and the like.
(TA.) You say, بَاعَهُ إِيَّاهُ إِلَي أَجَلٍ [He sold it
to him for payment at an appointed period]: and
سَلَّمَ الدَّارَاهِمَ فِى طَعَامٍ إِلَي أَجَلٍ [He delivered the
money for wheat, or the like, to be given at an
appointed period]. (Msb in art. كلأ.) ―
-b4-  The
term, or period, of death; (K;) the time in
which God has eternally decreed the end of life
by slaughter or otherwise: or, as some say, the
whole duration of life: and its end: a man's life
being thus termed: and his death, by which it
terminates: (Kull p. 17:) the assigned, or appointed, duration of the life of a man. (TA.) One
says, دَنَا أَجَلُهُ, meaning His death drew near;
originally, اسْتِيفَآءُ الأَجَلِ the completion of the
duration of life. (TA.) In the Kur vi. 128,
(see 2, above,) the meaning is, The term of death:
or, as some say, the term of extreme old age:
(TA:) or the day of resurrection. (Bd, * Jel.)
The words of the Kur [vi. 2] ثُمَّ قَضَى أَجَلًا وَ أَجَلٌ
مَسَمَّى عِنْدَهُ mean [Then He decreed a term,] the
term of death, and [there is a term named with
Him,] the term of the resurrection: or the period
between the creation and death, and the period
between death and the resurrection; for اجل is
applied to the end of a space of time and to the
whole thereof: (Bd:) or the meaning is, the
period of sleep, and the period of death: (Bd,
TA:) or the period of those who have passed
away, and the period of those who remain and
those who are to come: (Bd:) or the period of
remaining in this world, and the period of remaining in the world to come: or in both instances
death is meant; [accidental, and natural;] for
the اجل of some is by accidental means, as the
sword, and drowning, and burning, and eating
what disagrees, and other means of destruction;
while some have their full periods granted to them
and are preserved in health until they die a natural
death: or the اجل of some is that of him who
dies in a state of happiness and enjoyment; and
of others, that of him who reaches a limit beyond
which God has no? appointed, in the natural
course of this world, any one to remain therein;
and to both of these, reference is made in the Kur
[xvi. 72 and] xxii. 5. (TA.) ―
-b5-  Sometimes, also,
it means Destruction: and thus it has been explained as occurring in the Kur [vii. 184], where
it is said, وَأَنْ عَسَى أَنْ يَكُونَ قَدِ ا قْتَرَبَ أَجَلُهُمْ
[And that, may be, their destruction shall have
drawn near]. (TA.)
أَجِلْ: see أَجَلٌ.
أَجِلٌ: see آجِلٌ.
أَجِيلٌ Having a delay, or postponement, granted
to him, to a certain time; i. q. إِلَى وَقْتٍ ↓ مُؤَجَّلٌ.
(Lth.) ―
-b2-  See also آجِلٌ.
آجِلٌ Delayed; postponed; kept back; syn.
مُتَأَخِّرٌ; [but in some copies of the K, for آجِلٌ,
we find ↓ أَجِلٌ;] as also ↓ أَجِيلٌ, of which the pl.
is أُجْلٌ: (K:) and therefore, (TA,) not present;
future; to come; contr. of عَاجِلٌ: (S, Msb, TA:)
and ↓ مُتَأَجِّلٌ, also, signifies delayed, deferred, or
postponed, to the time of the end of a period;
originally, contr. of مُتَعَجِّلٌ. (Mgh.) [See also
أَجِيلٌ.] ―
-b2-  [Hence,] الآجِلَةُ The [future,] latter,
ultimate, or last, dwelling, or abode, or life; the
world to come; syn. الآخِرَةُ; (K, TA;) contr. of
العَاجِلَةُ. (S, TA.)
-A2-  Committing a crime; or a
committer of a crime. (S, TA.)
مُؤَجَّلٌ Determined, defined, or limited, as to
time; applied to a writing: so in the Kur iii. 139:
(Bd, Jel, TA:) and to a debt; contr. of حَالٌّ,
q. v. (Mgh in art. حل.) ―
-b2-  See also أَجِيلٌ.
مُتَأَجِّلٌ: see آجِلٌ.
