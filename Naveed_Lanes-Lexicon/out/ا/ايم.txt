her husband by his death, she being still fit for
husbands, having in her a remaining force of
youth: (T:) and you say, آمَتْ مِنْ زَوْجِهَا, aor.
تَئِيمُ, inf. n. أَيْمَةٌ and أَيْمٌ and أُيُومٌ, (S, TA,
[accord. to the former app. signifying the same
as آمَتْ alone as explained above: or]) meaning

It is said of the Prophet, in a trad., كَانَ يَتَعَوَّذُ
مِنَ الأَيْمَةِ (T, S) He used to pray for preservation
from remaining long without a wife. (T.) And
Yezeed Ibn-El-Hakam Eth-Thakafee says,
كُلُّ امْرِىءٍ سَتَئِيمُ مِنْهُ العِرْسُ أَوْمِنْهَا يَئِيمُ
(S) i. e. Every man, the wife will be bereft of
him by his death, or he will be bereft of her
by her death. (Ham p. 531.) One says also,
مَا لَهُ آمَ وَعَامَ, meaning [What aileth him?] May
his wife and his cattle die, or perish, so that he
shall have no wife (حَتَّى يَئيِمَ) and be vehemently
desirous of milk (يَعِيمَ). (S, K: [in the CK,
erroneously, امٌ و عامٌ; and in a MS. copy of the
K آمٌ ولاعامٌ.])

أَعَمْتُهَا; (T, S;) I made the woman to be a
widow, by slaying her husband. (T, * S, and
Ham ubi suprà.) Taäbata-sharrà says,

their husbands; and children fatherless]. (TA.)

أَيْمَانُ A man whose wife has died: and أَيْمَى
A woman whose husband has died: pl. أَيَامَى,
of both; like as سَكَارَي is pl. of سَكْرَانُ: accord.
to ISk, أَيَامَى is originally أَيَائِمُ. (Msb.) [See
also أَيِّمٌ.] أَيْمَانُ عَيْمَانُ are epithets applied to a
man, (M, K, TA,) meaning Whose wife [and
cattle] have died or perished [so that he has no
wife and is vehemently desirous of milk; as shown
above; see 1, last signification]: (TA:) the

(S, K, TA:) fem. أَيْمَى عَيْمَى, applied to a
woman. (M, K.)
أَيِّمٌ A woman having no husband; (Lth, T, S,
M, Mgh, Msb, K;) whether she be a virgin or

have married before or not; (Sgh, Msb;) as
also أَيِّمَةٌ; (Msb;) [said to be] applied to one
who has not married: (IAar, T:) or if not a
virgin; accord. to [the Imám] Mohammad;
agreeably with a reading of a trad. by which the
أَيِّم is distinguished from the virgin: (Mgh:)
also, the former, a man having no wife; (S, M,
Mgh, Msb, K;) whether he have married before
or not: (S, Sgh, K:) or who has not married:
(IAar, T:) pl. أَيَامَى (S, M, K) and أَيَائِمُ; (M,
K;) the latter of which is the original form:
(S, M:) [or both, accord. to the Msb, are pls.
of أَيْمَانُ, q. v.:] and أَيِّمُونَ is a pl. applied to
men, and أَيِّمَاتٌ applied to women: and آمَةٌ, also,
signifying men having no wives, is pl. of ↓ آئِمٌ for
أَيِّمٌ. (TA.) ―
