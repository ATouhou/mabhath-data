He (a beast) became wild, or sky; syn. تَوَحَّشَ:
(S, M, A, Mgh, L, Msb, K:) [because wild
animals live long, unless killed by accident; accord. to what is said by As and others in explanation of أوَابِدٌ (sing. آبِدَةٌ) applied to animals, as
meaning wild:] took fright, and fled, or ran away
at random: (Mgh:) took fright at, and shunned,
mankind. (T, Msb.) أُبُودٌ also signifies The
shrinking from a thing, or shunning it; syn. نُفُورٌ.

understood (K) at first sight, or on first consideration. (TA.) ―
-b4-  [And perhaps from أَبِدَ in
the sense explained above, but more probably, I
think, by the substitution of أ for و,] أَبِدَ, aor,
اَبَدَ,
(T, S, &c.,) inf. n. أَبَدٌ, (L,) He (a man, S) was
angry; (T, S, M, L, K;) as also أَمِدَ and وَبِدَ and

angry with him. (L.)
2
أبّد, inf. n. تَأْبِيدٌ, He made, or rendered,

إِبْدٌ: see إِبِدٌ
أَبَدٌ Time, syn. دَهْرٌ, (S, M, Msb, K,) in an
absolute sense: (TA:) or a long time, syn. دَهْرٌ
طَوِيلٌ: (A, and Mgh: [and this may be meant
in the S &c. by the syn. دَهْرٌ alone, q. v.:]) or,
properly, a long time (دهر طويل) that is unlimited:
(Msb, TA:) or an extended space of time that
is indivisible; for you say زَمَانُ كَذَا: “ the time
of such a thing,” but not أَبَدُ كَذَا: (Er-Rághib:)
[and generally, time, or duration, or continuance,
or existence, without end; endless time, &c.; prospective eternity; opposed to أَزَلٌ, which signifies
“ time, or duration, &c., without beginning: ” (see
the latter word for further explanations, &c.:) each
of these significations may be meant by the explanation in the S and M and K, which is also
given in the Msb: each correctly applies in particular instances:] pl. [of pauc.] آبَادٌ (S, M, Msb,
K) and [of mult.] أُبُودٌ (S, M, K) [and أَبَدُونَ, of
which an ex. will be found below]: but the use
of these pls. is restricted to particular cases, to
signify portions of time, or to serve as corroboratives to the sing.: (MF:) as signifying an extended indivisible space of time, [or the like,]
أَبَدٌ should have neither dual nor pl.; but آبَادٌ is
sometimes said, when the sing. is restricted to
denote a particular part, or portion, of the whole
of that to which it applies, in like manner as a
generic noun is restricted to a special and partial
signification: some, however, have mentioned
آبَادٌ as being post-classical; not of the language
of the Arabs called العَرَبُ العَرْبَآءُ. (Er-Rághib.)
طَالَ الأَبَدْ عَلَى لُبَدْ [The time became long to
Lubad, the last, and the longest of life, of Luk-
mán's seven vultures, to the term of the life of
which his own term of life was decreed to extend,]
is a proverb applied to any thing that has been of
long duration. (M.) And you say, رَزَقَكَ اللّٰهُ عُمُرًا
طَوِيلَ الآبَادِ بَعِيدَ الآمَادِ [May God grant thee a
life long in duration (lit. durations, the pl. form
being used not in its proper sense, but to give
intensiveness of signification), and remote in limit
(lit. limits)]. (A.) And كَانَ هٰذَا فِى آبَادِ الدَّهْرِ
This was a long time ago. (Mgh.) And ↓ أَبَدٌ آبِدٌ
(TA) and ↓ أَبَدٌ أَبِيدٌ, (S, M, TA,) meaning دَائِمٌ
[in an intensive sense]; (TA;) [A long, or an
endless, period of time;] like as you say, دَهْرٌ دَاهِرٌ
(S) or دَهْرٌ دَهِيرٌ. (M.) [In each of these phrases,
the latter word is added as a corroborative, or to
give intensiveness to the signification.] لِلْأَبِدَ and
لِأَبِدٍ and [in an intensive sense, as will be seen
below,] لِأَبِدَ أَبَدٍ and لِأَبَدِ الأَبَدِ, accord. to different
recitals of a trad., signify To the end of time; for
ever; and for ever and ever. (TA.) أَبَدًا is an adv. n.,
of which the signification includes all future time;
[meaning Ever; like قَطُّ in relation to past time;]
(El-Khafájee, El-Bedr Ed-Demámeenee, MF;)
and عَلَى الأَبَدِ signifies the same. (TA.) [So, too,
does الأَبَدَ, unless used in a limited sense known
to the hearer.] When you say, لَا أُكَلِّمُهُ أَبَدًا,
you mean, [I will not speak to him as long as I
live, or henceforth, or ever; or I will never speak
to him; i. e.,] from the time of your speaking to
the end of your life. (Msb.) [In this case, أَبَدًا
may also be considered as a mere corroborative. It
is used in both these ways (للتَّأْسِيسِ and لِلتَّوْكِيدِ)
in affirmative as well as negative sentences. For
exs. of its use in affirmative sentences, see the
Kur xviii. 2 and iv. 60, &c.] One also says,
لَا أَفْعَلُهُ, (S, M, A,) and لَا آتِيهِ, (T, K,) أَبَدَ الآبَادِ,
(T, M, A, K,) which, though of classical authority, is said to be no evidence of the use of آباد as
a pl. of أَبَدٌ in a general way by the Arabs of the
classical ages, as it is here added merely as a corroborative, as آزال is in the phrase أَزَلَ الآزَالِ;
(MF;) and أَبَدَ الأَبَدِينَ, (M, A, K,) in which the
latter word is not a rel. n., for if so it would be
الأَبَدِيِّينَ, but app. a pl., (M,) like أَرَضُونَ; (M,
K;) and ↓ أَبَدَ الآبِدِينَ, (S, K,) like as you say,
دَهْرَ الآبِدِينَ; (S;) and ↓ أَبَدَ الأَبَدِيَّةِ; (M, K;)
and ↓ أَبَدَ الأَبِيدِ; (T, S, M, A, K;) and أَبِيدَ
↓ الأَبِيدِ; (M, K;) and أَبَدَ الأَبَدِ; (K;) and أَبَدَ
الدَّهْرِ; (M, K; [in the T يَدَ الدَّهْرِ;]) all of
which phrases are the same in meaning; (K;)
[i. e. I will not do it, and I will not come to him,
(or لا آتيه may here mean the same as لا افعله,)
during the endless space of all future times, or time;
or the like; or for ever and ever;
εἰ� αἰῶνα τῶν αἰώνων
; in seculum seculorum; in omne ævum;]
the last word in every case being a corroborative.
(MF.) ―
-b2-  Also, [for ذُو أَبَدٍ, and (applied to a
fem. n.) ذَاتُ أَبَدٍ,] Lasting: or everlasting. (S,
A, K.) So in the saying, الدُّنيَاء أَمَدٌ وَالآخِرَةُ أَبَدٌ
[The present state of existence is limited in duration, but the final state of existence is everlasting].
('Obeyd Ibn-'Omeyr and L.) And الأَبَدُ signifies
[The Everlasting; i. e. God; because He alone
is ↓ البَاقِى الأَبَدِيّ The Enduring without end or
cessation; for the Muslims hold that all living
creatures (even the angels) must die, and be
raised again to life: or] The Ancient without
beginning. (K.)
-A2-  Also Offspring that is a year
old. (K.)
أَبِدٌ Unsocial, unsociable, unfamiliar, or shy;
like a wild animal; applied to a man, and to a
young camel: (S, L:) and ↓ إِبِدٌ, applied to a
female slave, and to a she-ass, signifies shunning
mankind, shy, or wild. (K.) [See also آبِدٌ.]
-A2-
See also إِبِدٌ, in four places.
إِبِدٌ: see أَبِدٌ.
-A2-  This word, (Lth, ISh, S, K,)
said by Lth and ISh to be the only word of its
measure heard from the Arabs except إِبِلٌ and
نِكِحٌ and خِطِبٌ, but Az says that he had not
heard the last two from any person worthy of
reliance, and that they are pronounced نِكْحٌ and
خِطْبٌ, (L,) [see إِبِلٌ,] and ↓ أَبِدٌ and ↓ إِبْدٌ, (K,)
which are thought by Az to be dial. vars. of the
first, (L,) applied to a female slave, and to a
she-ass, signify Prolific; that breeds, or brings
forth, plentifully; (S, K;) and ↓ أَبِدٌ and ↓ أَبِدَةٌ
(Aboo-Málik, TA) and ↓ إِبِدَةٌ, (Aboo-Málik, K,)
applied to a she-camel, signify the same: (Aboo-Málik, K, TA:) and إِبِدٌ (Lth, ISh, L) and ↓ أَبِدٌ,
(M, L,) applied to a female slave, (M, L,) and
to a she-ass, (Lth, ISh, M, L,) and to a mare,
(M, L,) that brings forth every year; (Lth, ISh,
L;) or applied as a pl. to the female slave and
the mare and the she-ass, that breed, or bring
forth: (M, L:) and الإِبِدَانِ the female slave and
the mare. (K, TA.) In the following saying,
الَّابِجَدِّ ذِى الإِبِدْ  لَنْ يُقْلِعَ الجَدُّ النَّكِدْ
فِى كُلِّ مَا عَامٍ تَلِدْ
[Hard fortune will not depart save with the fortune which is the necessary attendant of the possessor of the female slave, as long as he possesses
her, (or, if we take ذى in the sense of هٰذِهِ, save
with the fortune of this female slave,) who every
year (ما being redundant) brings forth,] الابد
means the female slave because her being prolific
is an obstacle to prosperity, and is not good fortune; i. e., she only increases evil [and brings
reproach upon her master by bearing him children;
for the Arab in ancient times was considered as
dishonoured by his having a child by a slave].
(S.) The Arabs also said, لَنْ يَبْلُغَ الجَدَّ النَّكِدْ
↓ الاَّ الأَبِدْ, meaning Nothing will attain to the
object of removing hard fortune save female
slaves and beasts or cattle which breed, or bring
forth. (M, L: [in the latter of which is added,
فِى كُلِّ عَامٍ تَلِدْ in every year bringing forth.])
أَبِدَةٌ: see إِبِدٌ.

مَا بَلَّ بَحْرٌ صُوفَةً. (M in art. صوف [q. v.]; &c.)
أَبُودٌ: see آبِدٌ.
أَبِيدٌ: see أَبَدٌ, in three places.
آبِدٌ Remaining, staying, abiding, or dwelling,

applied to a man [and to a bird]. (L.) And أَوَابِدُ

also ↓ مُتَأَبِّدٌ. (A.) Wild animals are called أَوَابِدُ
(S, M, L, K) and أُبَّدٌ (M, L, K) because they
endure for a long, or [naturally] unlimited, time;
(M, L;) because they do not die a natural death,
(As, M, L, K,) but from some evil accident; and
the same is asserted of the serpent. (As, M, L.)

formidable, event, at which people take fright, or
are alarmed: (TA:) or a strange, abominable,
or evil, thing: (Ham p. 627:) pl. أَوَابِدُ. (K.)

وَ أَوَابِدِى بِتَنَحُّلِ الأَشْعَارِ
