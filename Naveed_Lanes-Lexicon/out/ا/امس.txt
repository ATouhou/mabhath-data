امسإَمْس, meaning Yesterday, or the day before
the present day (Msb, K) by one night, (K,) and
tropically applied to (tropical:)  what is before that, (Msb,)
or a short time before, (Bd in x. 25,) [used as a
subst. and as an adv.,] is indecl., with any of the
three vowels for its termination: (K:) [written
أَمْسِ and أمْسَ and أمْسُ:] or it is an adv. n.,
indecl., with kesr for its termination, unless made
indeterminate, or made determinate [be the article
ال]; and sometimes indecl. with fet-h: (EzZejjájee, M, TA:) or, accord. to I Hsh, the termination with fet-h is a rejected form; and that with
damm is not mentioned by any of the grammarians: (TA:) but مُذْ أَمْسَ [Since yesterday]
occurs, used by poetic licence: (Sb, S:) أَمْس is
a noun of which the last letter is made movent to
avoid the concurrence of two quiescent letters:
and the Arabs differ respecting it: (S:) most of
them make it indecl., with kesr for its termination,
when it is determinate [without the article ال]:
but some of them make it [imperfectly] decl.
when it is determinate [in the same manner]: (S,
K: *) [accord. to the most approved usage,] you
say, [رَأَيْتُهُ أَمْسِ, and بِالأَمْسِ, which is more common, and الأَمْسَ, I saw him yesterday; and]
مَا رَأَيْتُهُ مُذْأَمْسِ [I have not seen him since
yesterday]; and if you have not seen him [since
the day next] before that, you say, مَا رَأَيْتُهُ مُذْ أَوَّلُ
مِنْ أَمْسِ [I have not seen him since the day
before yesterday]; and if you have not seen him
[since] two days before that, you say, مَا رَأَيْتُهُ مُذْ
أَوَّلُ مِنْ أَوَّلَ مِنْ أَمْسِ [I have not seen him since
the day before the day before yesterday]. (ISk,
TA.) The phrase رَأَيْتُهُ أَمْسٍ [I saw him yesterday] has also been heard, but it is extr. (K.)
The people of El-Hijáz make أَمْس indecl., with
kesr for its termination; and the Benoo-Temeem
do the same when it is in the accus. or gen. case;
but these latter make it [imperfectly] decl. when
it is in the nom. case, saying, ذَهَبَ أَمْسُ بِمَا فِيهِ
[Yesterday has gone with what happened during
it]; whereas the people of El-Hijáz say, ذَهَبَ
أَمْسِ بِمَا فِيهِ, because it is [held by them to be]
indecl. on account of its implying that it has the
determinative article ال [understood as prefixed
to it], the kesreh being added to avoid the
concurrence of two quiescent letters; while the
Benoo-Temeem hold it to be, in the nom. case,
a deviation from الإَمْسُ, and therefore imperfectly
decl., because of its being determinate, [and so
resembling a proper name,] and its deviation from
the original form, like سَحَرُ in the like case: (IB,
TA:) all of the Arabs, however, make it decl.
when the article ال is prefixed to it, (S, K, *)
and when it is made indeterminate, or is prefixed
to another noun: (S:) they say, using it indeterminately, كُلُّ غَدٍ صَائِرٌ أَمْسٍا [Every morrow becomes a yesterday]; (S, * IB;) and making it
determinate by the article ال, they say, كَانَ
الأَمْسُ طَيِّبًا [The yesterday was good], (IB,) and
مَضَي الأَمْسُ المُبَارَكُ [The blessed yesterday has
past]; (S;) and prefixing it to another noun,
كُلُّ أَمْسِنَا كَانَ طَيِّبًا [All of our yesterday was
good], (IB,) and مَضَى أَمْسُنَا [Our yesterday has
past]: (S:) [therefore,] in the following verse,
وَإِنِّى وَقَفْتُ اليَوْمَ وَالأَمْسِ قَبْلَهُ
بِبَابِكَ حَتَّى كَادَتِ الشَّمْسُ تَغْرُبُ
[And verily I stood to-day, and yesterday before
it, at thy door until the sun was almost setting],
(thus related by IAar in two different ways,
الأَمْسِ and الأَمْسَ,) if we read الأَمْسِ, the ال is
redundant, because it is implied in the word
أَمْسِ; but if we read الأَمْسَ, the ال is not implied
in أَمْسَ, and therefore is prefixed to make it determinate. (IJ, M.) The pl. is آمُسٌ and آمَاسٌ,
(Zj, K,) both pls. of pauc., (Zj, TA,) and أمُوسٌ,
(Zj, K, TA, [in the CK, incorrectly, امُوْسٌ,])
which is a pl. of mult. (Zj, TA.) There is no
dim. form of أَمْس; like as there is none of غَدٌ
and البَارِحَةُ and كَيْفَ and أَيْنَ and مَتَى and أَىُّ
and مَا and عِندَ and the names of the months and
those of the days of the week, except الجُمْعَةُ.
(Sb, S.)
إِمْسِىٌّ, contr. to analogy, (M, TA,) and أَمْسِىٌّ
[which is agreeable with analogy] is allowable,
as related by Sgh on the authority of Fr, but the
former is the more chaste, (TA,) Of, or relating
to, or belonging to, yesterday. (M, TA.)
