اماأَمَا, used to denote an interrogation, is a compound of the interrogative hemzeh and the negative مَا: (M:) it is a mere interrogative [respecting a negative, like أَلَا]; as in the saying, أَمَا
تَسْتَحْيِى مِنَ اللّٰهِ [Art not thou ashamed for thyself, or of thyself, with respect to God?]. (Lth, T.)
―
-b2-  [IHsh says, after explaining two other usages
of أَمَا which we have yet to mention,] El-Málakee
adds a third meaning of أَمَا, saying that it is a particle denoting عَرْضٌ [or the asking, or requiring, a
thing in a gentle manner], like [أَلَا (q. v.) and]
لَوْلَا; and is connected peculiarly with a verb;
as in أَمَا تَقُومُ [Wherefore wilt not thou do stand?],
and أَمَا تَفْعَلُ [Wherefore wilt not thou do such
a thing?]; which may be explained by saying
that the hemzeh is used as an interrogative to
make one confess, or acknowledge, a thing, as
it is in أَلَمْ and أَلَا, and that مَا is a negative.
(Mughnee.) ―
-b3-  It is also an inceptive word, used
in the manner of أَلَا: (M:) followed by أَلَا, it
is syn. with أَلَا: (S:) [meaning Now: or now
surely: or] both of these meaning verily, or truly;
i. c. حَقًّا: and for this reason Sb allows one's
saying, أَمَا إنَّه مُنْطَلقٌ and أَمَا أَنَّهُ مُنْطَلقٌ [Verily,
or truly, he is going away]; with kesr after the
manner of أَلَا إِنَّهُ, and with fet-h after the manner
of حَقًّا أَنَّهُ: and هَمَا وَاللّٰهِ لَقَدْ كَانَ كَذَا is mentioned as meaning أَمَا وَ اللّٰهِ [&c., i. e. Verily, or
truly, by God, such a thing did indeed happen];
the ه being a substitute for the hemzeh: (M:)
so too حَمَى واللّٰه [or حَمَا واللّٰه]: (Sgh and K
in art. حمى:) it denotes the truth of the words
which follow it; as when you say, أَمَا إِنَّ زَيْدًا عَاقِلٌ,
meaning Truly, or properly speaking, not tropically, Zeyd is intelligent; and أَمَّا و اللّٰه قَد ضَرَبَ
زَيْدٌ عَمْرًا [Truly, &c., by God, Zeyd beat, or
struck, Amr]: (S in art. امو:) [in other words,]
it corroborates an oath and a sentence; as in
أَمَا وَ اللّٰه لَئِنْ سْهَرْتُ لَكَ لَيْلَةً لَأَ دَعَنَّكَ نَادِمًا [Verily,
or now surely, by God, if I remain awake for
thee a night, then will I indeed leave thee repenting]; and أَمَا لَو عَلِمْتُ مَكَانَكَ لَأَزْعَجْتُكَ مِنْهُ [Verily,
or now surely, if I had known thy place of being,
then had I unsettled thee, or removed thee, from
it]; and أَمَا إِنَّهُ لَرَجُلٌ كَرِيمٌ [Verily, or now
surely, he is (emphatically) a generous man]:
(T:) or it is an inceptive particle, used in the
manner of أَلَا; [meaning now: or now surely:]
(Mughnee:) or a particle used to give notice of
what is about to be said: only put before a proposition [as in exs. mentioned above]: (TA:)
and often occurring before an oath [as in exs.
mentioned above]: and sometimes its hemzeh
is changed into ه or ع, before the oath; each
with the ا remaining; [written هَمَا or عَمَا;] and
with the ا elided; [written هَمَ or عَمَ;] or with
the ا elided, but without the substitution; [written
أَمَ;] and when انَّ occurs after أَمَا, it is with
kesr, as it is after أَلَا: and it also means حَقًّا
[verily, or truly]: or أَحقًّا [verily? or truly?]:
accord. to different opinions: and in this case,
انَّ after it is with fet-h, as it is after حَقَّا: accord.
to Ibn-Kharoof, this is a particle: but some say
that it is a noun in the sense of حَقًّا: and others,
that it consists of two words, namely, the interrogative hemzeh and مَا as a noun in the sense of
شَىْءٌ; i. e. أَذالِكَ الشَّىْءُ حَقٌّ [is that thing ture?];
so that the meaning is أَحَقًّا: [if so, أَمَا أَنَّه مُنْطَلقٌ
means Verily, or truly, is he going away?] and
this, which is what Sb says, is the correct opinion:
مَا is virtually in the accus. case, as an adverbial
noun, like as حَقًّا is literally: and أَنَّ with its
complement is an inchoative, of which the adverbial noun is the enunciative: but Mbr says that
حَقًّا is the inf. n. of يَحِقُّ, which is suppressed,
and that أنَّ with its complement is an agent.
(Mughnee.)
أَمَّا is a conditional and partitive and corroborative particle; and is sometimes written أَيْمَا, by
the change of the first م into ى. (Mughnee, K.)
―
-b2-  It is used as a conditional particle in the
words of the Kur [ii.24], فأَمَّا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا فَيَعْلَمُونَ
أَنَّهُ الْحَقُّ مِنْ رَبِّهِمْ وَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا فَيَقُولُونَ مَا
ذَا أَرَادَ اللّٰهُ بِهذَا مَثَلاً [For as for those who have
believed, they know that it is the truth from their
Lord; but as for those who have disbelieved, they
say, What is it that God meaneth by this as a
parable?]. (Mughnee,* K,* TA.) That it denotes
a condition is shown by the necessary occurrence
of ف after it; for if this ف were a conjunction, it
would not be prefixed to the enunciative; and if
it were redundant, it might be dispensed with;
but it may not be dispensed with except in a case
of necessity in poetry or in a case of an ellipsis.
―
-b3-  In most cases, (Mughnee, K,) it is used as a
partitive, (S, Mughnee, K,) implying the meaning
of a condition; (S; [in which it is mentioned with
أَمَا;]) and thus it is used in the passage of the
Kur cited above; (Mughnee;) and in the following exs. [in the Kur xviii. 78 and 79 and 81],
أَمَّا السَّفِينَةُ فَكَانَتْ لِمَسَاكِينَ يَعْمَلُونَ فِى البَحْرِ and
وَأَمَا الْغُلَامُ فَكَانَ أَبَوَاهُ مُؤْمِنِينَ and وأَمَّا الْجِدَارُ فَكَانَ
لِغلَامَينِ يَتَيمَيْنِ [As for the ship, it belonged to
poor men who worked on the sea . . . and as for
the boy, his two parents were believers . . . and
as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys].
(Mughnee, * K, * TA.) [It is a partitive also in
the phrase أَمَّابَعْدُ, which see in art. بعد.] ―
-b4-
Few have mentioned its use as a corroborative:
(Mughnee:) it is thus used in the phrase أَمَّا زَيْدٌ
فَذَاهِبٌ [Whatever be the case, or happen what
will or what may, or at all events, Zeyd is going
away], when you mean that Zeyd is inevitably
going away, and determined, or decided, upon
doing so: (Z cited in the Mughnee, and K:)
therefore Sb explains it as meaning, in this case,
مَهْمَا يَكُنْ مِنْ شَىْءٍ [whatever be the case, &c., as
above, or, in some instances, happen what would
or what might]; thereby showing it to be a
corroborative, and to have a conditional meaning:
(Z cited in the Mughnee: [and the same explanation of it is given, with a similar ex., in the S, in
art. امو:]) the فَ, in this case, is transferred from
its proper place before the inchoative, and put
before the enunciative. (I 'AK p. 306.) Ks says
that أَمَّا is used in commanding and forbidding
and announcing: you say, أَمَّا اللّٰهَ فَاعْبُدْ [Whatever be the case, or happen what will, &c., God
worship thou]: and أَمَّا الخَمْرَ فَلَا تَشْرَبْهَا [i. e.
أَمَّا الخَمْرَ فَلَا تَشْرَبْهَا (as is shown in the
case of a similar ex. in the Mughnee, though you
may say أَمَّا الخَمْرُ فَلَا تَشْرَبْهَا, without an ellipsis,
like as you say أمَّا ثَمُودُ فَهَدَيْنَاهُمْ as well as
أَمَّا ثَمُودَ, in the Kur xli. 16, accord. to different
readers,) Whatever be the case, &c., wine (drink
not), drink not thou it]: and أَمَّا زَيْدٌ فَخَرَجَ
[Whatever be the case, &c., with respect to other
things, Zeyd has gone forth; or whatever be the
case with respect to others, as for Zeyd, he has
gone forth]: whereas إِمَّا [which see in the next
paragraph] is used in expressing a condition and in
expressing doubt and in giving option and in
taking option. (T.) ―
-b5-  [IHsh says that in his
opinion,] in the phrase أَمَّا العَبِيدَ فَذُو عَبِيدٍ, thus
heard, with العبيد in the accus. case, the meaning
is, مَهَما ذَكَرْتَ [&c., i. e. Whenever thou mentionest the slaves, he is a possessor of slaves: but
I would rather say that the meaning is, أَمَّا ذِكْرُكَ
العَبِيدَ, &c., i. e. as for thy mentioning the slaves,
&c.]: and so in similar phrases which have been
heard. (Mughnee.)
-A2-  Distinct from the foregoing is أَمَّا in the saying in the Kur [xxvii. 86],
أَمَّا ذاكُنْتُمْ تَعمَلُونَ [Or rather, what is it that
ye were doing?]: for here it is a compound of the
unconnected أَمْ and the interrogative مَا (Mughnee.)
-A3-  So too in the saying of the poet,
أَبَا خُرَاشَةَ أَمَّا أَنْتَ ذَا نَسفَرٍ
فَإنَّ قُوْمِىَ لَمْ تَأكُلْهُمُ الضَّبُعُ
[O Aboo-Khurásheh, because thou wast possessor
of a number of men dost thou boast? Verily, my
people, the year of dearth, or of sterility, hath not
consumed them]: for here it is a compound of the
أَنْ termed مَصُدَرِيَّة [which combines with a verb
following it to form an equivalent to an inf. n.]
and the redundant مَا: أَمَّا أَنْتَ is for لِأَنْ كُنْتَ;
the preposition and the verb are suppressed for
the sake of abridgment, so that the pronoun [تَ
in كُنْتَ] becomes separate; and مَا is substituted
for the verb [thus deprived of its affixed pronoun], and the ن [of ان] is incorporated into the
م [of ما]. (Mughnee.) [See another reading of
this verse voce إِمَّا; and there also, immediately
after, another ex. (accord. to the Mughnee) of
أَمَّا used in the manner explained above. See also
أَنْ as a conditional particle, like إِنْ.]
-A4-  Also
i. q. إِمَّا, q. v. (Mughnee, K.)
إِمَّا is sometimes written أَمَّا, and sometimes its
first م is changed into ى, [forming أَيْمَا or إِيْمَا or
both, as will be shown below,] (Mughnee, [in
my copy of which it is written أَيْمَا, and so in
some copies of the K,] and K, [in some copies of
which it is written إيمَا,]) and it is held by Sb to
be a compound of إِنْ and مَا, (Mughnee,) or as
denoting the complement of a condition it is a
compound of إِنْ and مَا. (M, K.) ―
-b2-  It denotes
doubt; (Ks, T, Mughnee, K;) as in مَا أَدْرِى مَنْ
قَامَ إِمَّا زَيْدٌوإِمَّا عَمْرٌو [I know not who stood:
either Zeyd or 'Amr]: (Ks, T:) and جَآءَنِى إِمَّا
زَيْدٌ وَإِمَّا عَمْرٌو [There came to me either Zeyd or
'Amr], said when one knows not which of them
came. (Mughnee, K.) ―
-b3-  It also denotes vagueness of meaning; as in [the Kur ix. 107,] إِمَّا
يُعَذِّبُهُم وأمَّا يَتُوبُ عَلَيْهِمْ [Either He will punish
them or He will turn unto them with forgiveness].
(Mughnee, K.) ―
-b4-  It also denotes giving option;
as in [the Kur xviii. 85,] إِمَّا أَن تُعَذِّبَ وإِمَّا أَنْ
تَتَّخِذَ فِيِهِمْ حُسْناً [Either do thou punish, or do
thou what is good to them]. (Mughnee, K.) ―
-b5-
It also denotes the making a thing allowable;
as in تَعَلَّمْ إِمَّا فِقْهًا وإِمَّا نَحْوًا [Learn thou either
low or syntax; (an ex. given in the T, on the
authority of Ks, as an instance of the usage of
إِمَّا to denote giving option;)] but its use with
this intent is disputed by some, (Mughnee, K,)
while they assert it of أَوْ. (Mughnee.) ―
-b6-  It is
also used as a partitive; as in [the Kur lxxvi. 3,]
إمَّا شَاكِراً و إمَّا كَفُورًا [Either, or whether, being
thankful or being unthankful]; (Mughnee, K;)
the two epithets being here in the accus. case as
denotatives of state: or, accord. to the Koofees,
إمَّا may be here [a compound of] the conditional إِنْ
and the redundant مَا; كَانَ, accord. to Ibn-EshShejeree, being understood after it: (Mughnee:)
and Fr says that the meaning is, إِنْ شَكَرَ وَإِنْ كَفَرَ
[if he be thankful and if he be unthankful]. (T.)
―
-b7-  It also denotes taking option; as in the saying,
لِى دَارٌ بِالكُوفَةِ فَأنَا خَارِجٌ إلَيْهَا فَإمَّا أَنْ أَسْكُنَهَا وإِمَّا أَنْ
أَبِيعَهَا [I have a house in El-Koofeh, and I am
going forth to it, and either I will inhabit it or I
will sell it: but this is similar to the usage first
mentioned above]. (Ks, T.) ―
-b8-  It is a conjunction,
(S in art. امو, and Mughnee,) accord. to most
authorities, i. e., the second إِمَّا in the like of the
saying, جَاءَنِى إمَّا زَيْدٌ وإِمَّا عَمْرٌو [mentioned
above]; (Mughnee;) used in the manner of أَوْ
in all its cases except this one, that in the use of
او you begin with assurance, and then doubt
comes upon you; whereas you begin with إِمَّا in
doubt, and must repeat it; as in the saying last
mentioned: (S: [and the like is said in the
Mughnee, after the explanations of the meanings:]) but some assert that it is like the first إِمَّا,
not a conjunction; because it is generally preceded by the conjunction و: and some assert that
إِمَّا conjoins the noun with the noun, and the و
conjoins إِمَّا with إِمَّا; but the conjoining of a
particle with a particle is strange. (Mughnee.)
―
-b9-  Sometimes the و is suppressed; as in the
following verse, (Mughnee,) of El-Ahwas; (S;)
يَا لَيْتَمَا أُمُّنِا شَالَتْ نَعَامَتُهَا
أَيْمَا إِلَى جَنَّةٍ أَيْمَا إِلَى نَارِ
[O, would that our mother took her departure,
either to Paradise or Hell-fire!]; (S,* Mughnee,
K;) cited by Ks, with ايما for إِمَّا: (T:) and
sometimes it is with kesr [i. e. إِيمَا]: (S:) IB
says that it is correctly إِمَّا, with kesr; asserting
the original to be إِمَّا, with kesr, only. (TA.) ―
-b10-
And sometimes the former مَا is dispensed with;
as in the following verse, (Mughnee,) which
shows also that مَا is sometimes suppressed;
سَقَتْهُ ارَّوَاعِدُ مِنْ صَيِّفٍ
وَإِنْ مِنْ خَرِيفٍ فَلَنْ يَعْدَمَا
[The thundering clouds of summer-rain watered him, or of autumn-rain; so he will not
want sufficient drink]: i. e. إِمَّا مِنْ صَيِّفٍ وَإِمَّا مِنْ
خَرِيفٍ. (Mughnee, K.) Mbr and As say that
إِنْ is here conditional, and that the ف is its complement: but this assertion is of no weight; for
the object is the description of a mountain-goat as
having sufficient drink in every case: AO says
that إِنْ in this verse is redundant. (Mughnee.)
―
-b11-  Sometimes, also, one does not require to mention the second إِمَّا, by mentioning what supplies
its place; as in the saying, إِمَّا أَنْ تَتَكَلَّمَ بِخَيْرٍ
وَإِلَّا فاسْكُتْ [Either do thou speak what is good or
else be silent]. (Mughnee.) [See art. الا, near
its end.]
-A2-  Distinct from the foregoing is إِمَّا in
the saying in the Kur [xix. 26], فَإِمَّأِتَريِنَّ مِنَ
الْبَشَرِ أَحَدًاِ [And if thou see, of mankind, any
one]: for this is [a compound of] the conditional
إِن and the redundant مَا. (S * in art. امو, and
Mughnee.) [In like manner,] you say, in expressing a condition, إِمَّا تَشْتِمَنَّ زْيدًا فَإِنَّهُ يَحْلُمُ عَنْكَ
[If thou revile Zeyd, he will treat thee with forbearance]. (Ks, T.) And إِمَّا تَأْتِنِي أُكِْرِمْكَ [If
thou come to me, I will treat thee with honour].
(S.) ―
-b2-  In the following saying, إِمَّا أَنْتَ مُنْطَلِقًا
انْطَلَقْتُ [If thou be going away, I go away], the
مَا is not that which restrains the particle to which
it is subjoined from governing, but is a substitute
for a verb; (K and TA in art. مَا;) as though the
speaker said, إِذَا صِرْتَ مُنْطَلِقًا [or rather إِنْ صِرْتَ].
(TA in that art.) And hence the saying of the
poet, [of which a reading different from that here
following has been given voce أَمَّا,]
أَبَا خُرَاشَةَ إِمَّا أَنْتَ ذَا نَسفَرٍ
فَإنَّ قَوْمِىَ لَمْ تَإْكُلْهُمُ الضَّبُغُ
[O Aboo-Khurásheh, if thou be possessor of a
number of men, verily, my people, the year of
dearth, or of sterility, hath not consumed them];
as though he said, إِنْ كُنْتُ ذَا نَفَرٍ. (TA in that
art.) [But IHsh states the case differently; saying,] An instance of أَمَّا أَنْتَ مُنطَلِقًا انْطَلَقْتُ not used to restrain from
governing, but as a substitute for a verb, occurs in
the saying, أَمَّا أَنْتَ مُنطَلِقًا اِنْطَلَقْتُ [Because thou
wast going away, I went away]; originally,
اِنْطَلَقْتُ لِأَنْ كُنْتَ مُنطَلِقاً: [for an explanation
of which, see what is said of أَمَّا أَنْتَ in a reading
of the verse commencing with أَبَا خُرَاشَة voce أَمَّا:]
but accord. to El-Fárisee and IJ, the government
belongs to مَا; not to كَانَ [or كُنْتَ]. (Mughnee in art. مَا.) ―
-b3-  So too in the saying, اِفْعَلْ هذَا
إِمَّالَا, meaning إِنْ كُنْتَ لَاتَفْعَلُ غَيْرَهُ [i. e. Do
thou this if thou wilt not do another thing; or do
thou this at least]; (Mughnee and K, each in
art. مَا;) indicating a person's refusal to do [fully]
that which he is ordered to do: (TA in that art.:)
or إِمَّالَا فَافْعَلْ كَذَا, meaning if thou wilt not do
that, then do thou this; the three particles [إِنْ
and مَا and لَا] being made as one word: so says
Lth: (T:) [J says,] إِمَّالَا فَافْعَلْ كَذَا is pronounced with imáleh, [i. e. “ immá-lè,”] and is
originally إِن لَا with مَا as a connective; and the
meaning is, if that thing will not be, then do thou
thus: (S in art. لَا:) [but] AHát [disallows this
pronunciation, and] says, sometimes the vulgar,
in the place of اِفْعَلْ ذٰلِكَ إِمَّالَا, say, اِفْعَلْ ذٰلِكَ بَارِى
[Do thou that at least]; but this is Persian, and is
rejected as wrong: and they say also, أُمَّالَىْ, with
damm to the ا [and with imáleh in the case of the
final vowel, and thus it is vulgarly pronounced in
the present day]; but this too is wrong; for it is
correctly إِمَّالَا, [with kesr, and] not pronounced
with imáleh, for particles [in general] are not
thus pronounced: (T:) and the vulgar also convert the hemzeh into ه with damm [saying هُمَّالَىْ].
(TA in art. مَا.) [Fei says,] لَا is a substitute for
the verb in the saying, إِمَّالَا فَافْعَلْ هٰذَا, the meaning being If thou do not that, then [at least] do
thou this: the origin thereof is this; that certain
things are incumbent on a man to do, and he is
required to do them, but refuses; and then one is
content with his doing some, or a part, of them,
and says to him thus: i. e., if thou wilt not do
all, then do thou this: then the verb is suppressed,
on account of the frequency of the usage of the
phrase, and مَا is added to give force to the
meaning: and some say that it is for this reason
that لَا is here pronounced with imáleh; because
it serves for the verb; like as بَلَى is, and the
vocative يَا: but it is said that it is correctly pronounced without imáleh; because particles [in
general] are not pronounced therewith; as Az
says. (Msb in art. لَا.) [El-Hareeree says that]
إِمَّالَا is properly [a compound of] three particles,
which are إِنْ and مَا and لَا, made as one word,
and the ا at the end thereof is like the ا of حُبَارَى
[in which it is written ى, agreeably with rule];
wherefore it is pronounced with imáleh, like as is
the ا of this latter word. (Durrat el-Ghowwás, in
De Sacy's Anthol. Gr. Ar. p. 57 of the Arabic
text.) In the Lubáb it is said that لَا is used as a
negative of the future, as in لا تَفْعَلْ; and the
verb [in إِمَّالَا] is suppressed; so it [لا] serves as a
substitute in the saying, اِفْعَلْ هٰذَا إِمَّالَا; therefore
they pronounce its ا with imáleh: and IAth says
that the Arabs sometimes pronounced لَا with a
slight imáleh; and the vulgar make the imáleh
thereof full, so that its ا becomes ى; but this is
wrong. (TA.) You say also, خُذْ هٰذَا إِمَّالَا,
meaning Take thou this if thou take not that.
(T.) It is related that the Prophet saw a runaway
camel, and said, “To whom belongeth this camel? ”
when, lo, some young men of the Ansár said,
“ We have drawn water upon him during twenty
years, and yet he has in him fat; so we desired
to slaughter him; but he escaped from us. ” He
said, “Will ye sell him? ” They answered, “No:
but he is thine. ” And he said, إِمَّالَا فأَحْسِنُوا إِلَيْهِ
حَتَّى يأْتِيَهُ أَجَلُهُ, meaning If ye will not sell him,
act well to him until his term of life come to
him. (T.)
