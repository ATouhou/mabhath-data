accord. to J, (Msb,) it is thus, with teshdeed, but

Msb,) A certain place in which fire is kindled,
(S, Mgh,) called in Persian كُلَخْن [or كُلْخَنْ],
pertaining to a bath: and metaphorically applied
to (tropical:)  that in which bricks are baked, and called in
Persian تُونَقْ and دَاشُوزَنْ [or simply تُونْ and

former,] is أَتَاتِينُ, (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K, [in

accord. to Fr, who says that they sometimes
double a letter in the pl. when they do not double
it in the sing., (T,) and accord. to IJ, who says
that it seems as though they changed أَتُونٌ to
أَتُّونٌ; (M;) and [of أَتُونٌ, as is said in the TA
and implied in the M,] أُتُنٌ. (M, K.) [J says
that] it is said to be post-classical; (S;) [and ISd
says,] I do not think it to be Arabic. (M.)
