استاذأُسْتَاذٌ a foreign word, pronounced to be such
because س and ذ do not occur in any one Arabic
word, (Msb,) not found in the poetry of the pagan
times, (Ibn-Dihyeh in TA art. ستذ,) nor in the
language of those times, (Shifá el-Ghaleel, ibid.,)
[arabicized from the Persian أُسْتَادْ,] A master:
(MF:) a skilful man, who is held in high estimation: (Msb:) a preceptor; a tutor; a teacher:
a craftmaster: (Ibn-Dihyeh; and Golius on the
authority of Meyd:) [and so in the present day;
as also أُسْتَا and أُسْطَا:] also applied by the vulgar
to a eunuch; because he generally tutors children:
(Shifá el-Ghaleel, and Ibn-Dihyeh:) pl. أُسْتَاذُونَ
(Har p. 377) [and أَسَاتِيذُ and أَسَاتِذَةٌ; and vulgarly, in the present day, أُسْتَوَاتٌ and أُسْطَوَاتٌ].
