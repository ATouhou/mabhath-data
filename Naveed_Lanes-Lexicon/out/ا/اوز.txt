اوزإِوَزٌّ (S, Msb, K) and إِوَزَّةٌ, (S,) or the latter
is the n. un. of the former, [which is a coll. gen.
n.,] (Msb,) i. q. بَطٌّ [The goose, or geese; and the
duck, or ducks; but اوزّ is generally applied to the
former of these birds; and بطّ, to the latter;
agreeably with a statement in the Jm, that بَطٌّ is
applied by the Arabs to the small, and إِوَزٌّ to the
large]; (S, K;) as also وَزٌّ, of which the n. un. is
وَزَّةٌ: (Msb:) إِوَزٌّ is of the measure فِعَلٌّ: (Msb:)
[but see what follows:] the pl. is إِوَزُّونَ, (S, Msb,
K,) a form which is sometimes used, (S, Msb,)
and which is anomalous. (Msb.) [See also
كُرْكِىٌّ.] ―
-b2-  [Hence,] إِوَزٌّ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  Short
and thick: (K:) fleshy without being tall: (Lth,
TA:) fem. with ة. (TA.) El-'Okberee asserts
that the أ is augmentative, because it is followed
by three radical letters: (MF, TA:) but ISd says
that it is of the measure فِعَلٌّ, and may not be of
the measure إِفْعَلٌ, [i. e., originally إِوْزَزٌ,] because
this does not occur as the measure of an epithet.
(TA.) [It seems, however, that اوزّ is in this case
a subst. used tropically as an epithet, after the
manner of many nicknames.] ―
-b3-  Also, applied to
a man, and to a horse, and to a camel, Firm in
make: (AHei in the Expos. of the Tes-heel, and
TA:) or, applied to a horse, compact and strong
in make. (TA.)
إِوَزَّي A manner of walking in which is a moving
up and down: or leaning on one side; (K;) [the
latter omitted in the CK;] at one time on the
right and at another on the left [like a goose or
duck]: (TA:) and the walk of a sprightly horse.
(TA.) Az says that it may be of the measure
إِفْعَلَى, [i. e., originally إِوْزَزَّى,] or فِعَلَّى; but
Abu-l-Hasan holds the latter to be the more correct, because it is the measure of many words
relating to walking; as جِيَضَّى, and دِفَقَّى. (TA.)
أَضٌ مَأْوَزَةٌ A land abounding with the birds
called إِوَزّ. (Sgh, K.)
