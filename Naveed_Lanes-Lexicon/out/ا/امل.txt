امل1
أَمَلَهُ, (T, S, M, &c.,) aor.
اَمُلَ, (T, S, M, Msb,)
and
اَمِلَ, (so in the M accord. to the TT,) inf. n.
أَمَلٌ, (T, S, M, &c.,) this being the inf. n. accord.
to IJ, [as distinguished from أَمْلٌ and إِمْلٌ,]
(M,) He hoped it; or hoped for it; syn. رَجَاهُ;
(S, * M, * [see أَمَلٌ below,] K;) meaning, what
was good for him; (S;) as also ↓ أمَلهُ, (T, * M,
K,) inf. n. تَأميلٌ: (S, T:) or he expected it;
[or had a distant, or remote, expectation of it;
for] it is mostly used in relation to that of which
the occurrence, or coming to pass, is deemed
remote; as in the saying of Zuheyr,
أَرْجُو وَآمُلُ أَنْ تَدْنُو مَوَدَّتُهَا
[I hope, and have a distant expectation, that her
love may approach]: he who has determined
upon a journey to a distant town or country says,
أَمَلْتُ الوُصُولَ [I have formed an expectation, or
a distant expectation, of arriving]; but he does
not say, طَمِعْتُ until he has become near thereto;
for طَمَعٌ relates only to that of which the occurrence, or coming to pass, is [deemed] near: and
الرَّجَآءُ is between الأَمَلُ and الطَّمَعُ; for it is sometimes attended with fear that the thing expected
may not come to pass, wherefore it is used in
the sense of fear; and when the fear is strong,
[lest the thing expected should not come to pass,
it denotes distant expectation, and thus] it is used
in the sense of الأَمَلُ; whence the usage in the
verse of Zuheyr; but otherwise it is used in the
sense of الطَّمَعُ: (Msb:) or الرجاء signifies the
expectation of benefit, or advantage, from some
preceding cause or means: so says El-Harállee:
or it is properly syn. with الأَمَلُ; and in common
conventional language, means the clinging of the
heart to the coming to pass of a future desired event:
so says Ibn-El-Kemál: or, accord. to Er-Rághib,
an opinion requiring the coming to pass of an
event in which will be a cause of happiness:
(TA:) and ↓ أمّلهُ, inf. n. تَأْمِيلٌ, signifies he expected it much; and is more commonly used
than the form without teshdeed. (Msb.)

تأملالشَّىءِ [He considered the thing, or
studied it, or contemplated it, carefully, or attentively, with investigation;] he looked at the
thing endeavouring to obtain a clear knowledge
of it: (S:) or i. q. تَدَبَّرَهُ; (Msb, TA;) i. e.,
(Msb,) he looked into the thing, considered it,
examined it, or studied it, repeatedly, (Msb, TA,)
in order to know it, or until he knew it, (Msb,)
or in order to ascertain its real case: (TA:) or
he looked intently, or hardly, at, or towards, the
thing: (TA:) or تأمّل signifies he acted, or proceeded, deliberately, not hastily, syn. تَثَبَّتَ, (T,
M,) or he paused, or waited, syn. تَلَبِّثَ, (K,)
in an affair, and in consideration; (M, K, TA;)
he paused, and acted with deliberation. (TA.)
فِيهِ تَأَمُّلٌ [meaning It requires careful, or attentive, consideration, or simply it requires consideration,] is a phrase [of frequent occurrence
in the larger lexicons &c., used to imply doubt,
and also to insinuate politely that the words to
which it relates are false, or wrong,] like فِيهِ نَظَرٌ
[q. v.]. (MF in art. صفح.)

إِمْلٌ: see أَمَلٌ.
أَمَلٌ (T, S, M, Msb, K) and ↓ إٍِمْلٌ (IJ, M, K)
and ↓ أَمْلٌ, (K,) the first of which is an inf. n.,
accord. to IJ, (M,) and is the form commonly
known, (TA,) Hope; syn. رَجَآءٌ: (S, M, K:) or
expectation; [or distant, or remote, expectation;
being] mostly used in relation to that of which
the occurrence, or coming to pass, is deemed
remote: applied also to an affection of the heart
from some good to be attained: (Msb, TA: [in
both of which are further explanations, for which
see 1:]) ↓ إِمْلَةٌ, also, signifies the same as أَمَلٌ,
(S, M, K,) or تَإْمِيلٌ; (Lh, M, K;) [or a manner
of hoping or expecting; for J adds,] and it is
like جِلْسَةٌ and رِكْبَةٌ: (S:) and ↓ مُؤَمَّلٌ, likewise, signifies the same as إَمَلٌ: (TA:) the pl.
of أمَلٌ and إَمْلٌ and أَمْلٌ is آمَلٌ. (M, * K, TA.)
You say, خَابَ سَعْيُهُ وَأَمَلُهُ [His labour, and his
hope, or expectation, were disappointed, frustrated, or balked]. (A and TA in art. خيب.) And
↓ مَا أَطْوَلَ إَمْلَتَهُ How far-reaching is his hope,
