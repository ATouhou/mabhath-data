ابجدأَبْجَدْ The first of a series of eight words comprising the letters of the Arabic alphabet [in the
order in which they were originally disposed,
agreeing with that of the Hebrew and Aramaic,
but with six additional letters: they are variously
written and pronounced; generally as follows:
أَبْجَدَ هَوَّزْ حُطِّى كَلَمَنْ سَعْفَصْ قَرَشَتْ ثَخَذْ ضَظَغْ:
but the Arabs of Western Africa write the latter
four thus: صعفض قرست ثخذ ظغش]: (K and
TA in art. بجد: [in both of which are related
several fables concerning the origin of these
words:]) accord. to the general opinion, the word
ابجد is of foreign origin, [like each of the words
following it,] and therefore its first letter [as well
as each of the others] is a radical. (TA.) [Hence,
الأَبْجَدُ signifies The alphabet. You say حُرُوفُ
الأَبْجَدِ The letters of the alphabet. ―
-b2-  It is probable (as De Sacy has observed in his Ar. Gram.,
2nd ed., i. 8,) that the Arabic alphabet originally
consisted of only twenty-two letters: for some of
the ancient Arabs called Saturday ابجد, Sunday
هوزّ, and so on to قرشت inclusive; calling Friday
عَرُوبَةُ. ―
-b3-  In the lexicon entitled “El-'Eyn,” the
letters of the alphabet are arranged nearly according to their places of utterance; as follows:
ع, ح, ه, خ, غ, ق, ك, ج, ش, ض, ص, س, ز, ط,
د, ت, ظ, ذ, ث, ر, ل, ن, ف, ب, م, و, ا, ى:
and this order has been followed in the Tahdheeb
and Mohkam and some other lexicons.]
