امن1
أَمِنَ, (T, S, M, &c.,) aor.
اَمَنَ, (T, Msb, K,)
inf. n. أَمْنٌ (T, S, M, Msb, K) and إِمْنٌ (Zj, M,
K) and أَمَنٌ (M, K) and أَمَنَةٌ (T, S, M, K) and
إِمْنَةٌ (T) and أَمَانٌ (M, K) [and app. أَمَانَةٌ, for
it is said in the S that this is syn. with أَمَانٌ,]
and آمنٌ, an instance of an inf. n. of the measure
فَاعِلٌ, which is strange, (MF,) or this is a subst.
like فَالِجٌ, (M,) He was, or became, or felt,
secure, safe, or in a state of security or safety;
originally, he was, or became, quiet, or tranquil,
in heart, or mind; (Msb;) he was, or became,
secure, or free from fear; أَمْنٌ signifying the
contr. of خَوْفٌ, (S, M, K,) and so أَمَنَةٌ (S) and
آمِنٌ [&c.]: (M, K:) he was, or became, or felt,
free from expectation of evil, or of an object of
dislike or hatred, in the coming time; originally,
he was, or became, easy in mind, and free from
fear. (El-Munáwee, TA.) [See أَمْنٌ, below.]
You say also, يَإْمَنُ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ [He is secure,
or safe, or free from fear, for himself]. (M.)
And أَمِنَ البَلَدُ, meaning The inhabitants of the
country or district, or town, were in a state of
security, or confidence, therein. (Msb.) The
verb is trans. by itself, and by means of the
particle مِنْ; as in أَمَنَ زَيْدٌ الأَسَدَ and أَمِنَ مِنَ
الأَسَدِ, meaning Zeyd was, or became, or felt,
secure from, safe from, [or free from fear of,]
the lion. (Msb.) You say also, أَمِنَ كَذِبَ مَنْ
أَخْبَرَهُ [He was secure from, or free from fear
of, the lying of him who informed him]. (M.)
And لَا آنَنُ أَنْ يَكُونَ كَذلِكَ [I am not free from
fear of its being so; I am not sure but that it
may be so]. (Mgh in art. نبذ; and other lexicons
passim.) And, of a strong-made she camel, أَمِنَتْ
أَنْ تَكُونَ ضَعَيفَةً [She was secure from, or free
from fear of, being weak]: (M: [in a copy of the
S أُمِنَتْ:]) and أَمِنَتِ العِثَارَ وَالإَعْيَآءٍ [She was
secure from, or free from fear of, stumbling, and
becoming jaded]: (M:) and أُمِنَ عِثَارُهَا [Her
stumbling was not feared]. (So in a copy of the
S.) And, of a highly-prized camel, أُمِنَ أَنْ يُنْحَرَ
[It was not feared that he would be slaughtered;
or his being slaughtered was not feared]. (M.)
[أَمنَهُ sometimes means He was, or became, free
from fear, though having cause for fear, of
him, or it. i. e. he thought himself secure, or safe,
from him or it. (See Kur vii. 97.)] ―
-b2-  أمِنَهُ
(inf. n. أَمْنٌ TK) [and accord. to some copies
of the K ↓ آمَنَهُ] and ↓ أمّنهُ (inf. n. تَأْمِينٌ K) and
↓ ائتمنهُ ([written with the disjunctive alif اِيتَمَنَهُ,
and] also written اِتَّمَنَهُ, on the authority of Th,
which is extr., like اِتَّهَلَ [&c.], M) and ↓ استأمنهُ
all signify the same (M, K, TA) [He trusted,
or confided, in him; (as also آمن بِهِ, q. v.;) he
intrusted him with, or confided to him, power,
authority, control, or a charge; he gave him
charge over a thing or person: these meanings
are vaguely indicated in the M and K and TA.].
You say, يَأْمَنُهُ النَّاسُ وَلَا يَخَافُونَ غَائِلَتَهُ [Men, or
people, trust, or confide, in him, and do not fear
his malevolence, or mischievousness]. (T, M.) And
أَمِنَهُ عَلَى كَذَا (S, Mgh, * Msb *) and ↓ ائتمنهُ
عَلَيْهِ, (S, Msb, K,) [He trusted, or confided, in
him with respect to such a thing; he intrusted
him with, or confided to him, power, authority, control, or a charge, over it; he gave him
charge over it;] he made him, or took him
as, أَمِين over such a thing. (Mgh.) Hence, in
a trad., the مُؤَذِّن is said to be مُؤْتَمَنٌ; i. e.
النَّاسُ عَلَ الأَوْقَاتِ الَّتِى يُؤَذَّنُ فِيهَا ↓ يَأْتَمِنُهُ [Men
trust, or confide, in him with respect to the times
in which he calls to prayer], and know, by his
calling to prayer, what they are commanded to
do, as to praying and fasting and breaking fast.
(Mgh.) It is said in the Kur [xii. 11], مَا لَكَ
لَا تَأْمَنُنَا عَلَى يُوسُفَ and [تَأْمَنَّا] with idghám [i. e.
What aileth thee that thou dost not trust, or
confide, in us with respect to Joseph? or, that
thou dost not give us charge over Joseph?]; (S;)
meaning, why dost thou fear us for him? (Bd;)
some pronouncing the verb in a manner between
those of the former and the latter modes of writing
it; but Akh says that the latter is better: (S:)
some read تِيمَنَّا. (Bd.) You say also, ↓ اُوتُمِنَ
فُلَانٌ [Such a one was trusted, or confided, in
&c.;] when it begins a sentence, changing the
second ء into و; in like manner as you change
it into ى when the first is with kesr, as in اِيتَمَنَهُ;
and into ا when the first is with fet-h, as in
آمَنَ. (S.) The phrase أَمَانَةً ↓ اُوتُمِنَ, in a saying
of Mohammad, if it be not correctly عَلَى أَمَانَةٍ,
may be explained as implying the meaning of
اُسْتُحْفِظَ أَمَانَةً [He was asked to take care of a
deposite; or he was intrusted with it]. (Mgh.)
[You also say, أَمِنَهُ بِكَذَا, meaning He intrusted
him with such a thing; as, for instance, money
or other property: see two exs. in the Kur iii. 68.]
-A2-  أَمُنَ, (M, Mgh, K,) or أَمِنَ, (Msb,) inf. n.
أَمَانَةٌ, (M, Mgh, Msb,) He was, or became,
trusted in, or confided in: (M, K:) or he was,
or became, trusty, trustworthy, trustful, confidential, or faithful: said of a man. (Mgh.)
2
أمّنهُ, inf. n. تَأْمِينٌ: see 4: ―
-b2-  and see also
أَمِنَهُ.
-A2-  أمّن, inf. n. as above, also signifies He
said آمِينَ or أَمِينَ, (T, S, Msb,) after finishing
the Fátihah, (T,) or عَلَي الدُّعَآءِ on the occasion of
the prayer, or supplication. (Msb.)
4
آمَنَ is originally أَأْمَنَ; the second ء being
softened. (S.) You say, آمنهُ, [inf. n. إِيمَانٌ;]
(S, M, Msb;) and ↓ أمّنهُ, [inf. n. تَأْمِينٌ;] (M,
TA;) meaning He rendered him secure, or safe;
(Msb;) he rendered him secure, or free from
fear; (S, M, TA;) contr. of أَخَافهُ: (TA:) so
in آمَنْتُهُ مِنْهُ I rendered him secure, or safe,
from him, or it. (Msb.) And of God you say,
آمَنَ عِبادَهُ مِنْ أَنْ يَظْلِمَهُمْ [He hath rendered
his servants secure from his wronging them].
(S.) And يُؤْمِنُ عِبَادَهُ مِنْ عَذَابِهِ [He rendereth
his servants secure from his punishment]. (M.)
You say also, آمَنْتُ الأَسِيرَ, meaning I gave, or
granted, الأَمَان [i. e. security or safety, or protection or safeguard, or the promise or assurance
of security or safety, or indemnity, or quarter,]
to the captive. (Msb.) And آمَنَ فُلَانٌ الَعَدُوَّ
[Such a one granted security, &c., to the enemy],
inf. n. as above. (T.) It is said in the Kur ch. ix.
[verse 12], accord. to one reading, لَا إِيمَانَ لَهُمْ
They have not the attribute of granting protection;
meaning that when they grant protection, they do
not fulfil their engagement to protect. (T.)
-A2-
إِيمَانٌ also signifies The believing [a thing, or in a
thing, and particularly in God]; syn. تَصْدِيقٌ;
(T, S, &c.;) by common consent of the lexicologists and other men of science: (T:) its primary
meaning is the becoming true to the trust with
respect to which God has confided in one, by a
firm believing with the heart; not by profession
of belief with the tongue only, without the assent
of the heart; for he who does not firmly believe
with his heart is either a hypocrite or an ignorant
person. (T, TA.) Its verb is intrans. and trans.
(TA, from a Commentary on the Mutowwal.)
You say, آمَنَ, meaning He believed. (T.) And
it is said to be trans. by itself, like صَدَّقَ; and by
means of بِ, considered as meaning اِعْتِرَافٌ [or
acknowledgment]; and by means of لِ, considered
as meaning إِذْعَانٌ [or submission]. (TA.) [Thus]
you say, [آمنهُ and] آمن بِهِ, (inf. n. إِيمَانٌ, T, K,)
namely, a thing. (T, M.) And آمن بِاللّٰهِ He
believed in God. (T.) It seems to be meant by
what is said in the Ksh [in ii. 2], that آمن بِهِ [or
آمَنَهُ] properly signifies آمَنَهُ التَّكْذِيبَ [He rendered him secure from being charged with lying,
or falsehood]; and that the meaning he believed
him or in him, is tropical; but this is at variance
with what its author says in the A; and Es-Saad
says that this latter meaning is proper. (TA.)
The phrase in the Kur [ix. 61], وَيُؤْمِنُ لِلْمؤْمِنِينَ,
accord. to Th, means And he believeth the believers; giveth credit to them. (M.) ―
-b2-  Sometimes
it is employed to signify The acknowledging with
the tongue only; and hence, in the Kur [lxiii. 3],
ذلِكَ بأَنَّهُمْ آمَنُوا ثُمَّ كَفَرُوا That is because they
acknowledged with the tongue, then disacknowledged with the heart. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Also (assumed tropical:)  The
trusting, or confiding, or having trust or confidence. (M, K.) [You say, آمن بِهِ, meaning
He trusted, or confided, in him, or it: for] the
verb of ايمان in this sense is trans. by means of
بِ without implication; as Bd says. (TA.)
[And it is also trans. by itself: for] you say,
مَا آمَنَ أَنْ يَجِدَ صَحَابَةً, meaning (tropical:)  He trusted
not that he would find companions; (M, * K, *
TA;) said of one who has formed the intention
of journeying: or the meaning is مَا كَادَ [i. e.
he hardly, or scarcely, found &c.; or he was not
near to finding &c.]. (M, K.) See also أَمِنَهُ. ―
-b4-
Also The manifesting humility or submission, and
the accepting the Law, (Zj, T, * K,) and that
which the Prophet has said or done, and the firm
believing thereof with the heart; (Zj, T, M;)
without which firm belief, the manifesting of
humility or submission, and the accepting that
which the Prophet has said or done, is termed
إِسْلَامٌ, for which one's blood is to be spared. (T.)
[In this sense, it is trans. by means of لِ, accord.
to some, as shown above; or by means of بِ, for,
accord. to Fei,] you say, آمَنْتُ بِاللّٰهِ, inf. n. as
above, meaning I submitted, or resigned, myself
to God. (Msb.) [There are numerous other
explanations which it is needless to give, differing
according to different persuasions. ―

استأمنهُ He asked, or demanded, of him
الأَمَان [i. e. security or safety, or protection or
safeguard, or the promise or assurance of security
or safety, or indemnity, or quarter]. (T, * Msb,
TA.) ―
-b2-  See also أَمِنَهُ. ―
-b3-  استأمن إِلَيْهِ He entered
within the pale of his أمَان [or protection, or safeguard]. (S, Msb.)
أَمْنٌ [an inf. n. of أَمِنِ: as a simple subst. it
signifies Security, or safety: (see أَمِنَ:) or]
security as meaning freedom from fear; contr.
of خَوْفٌ; (S, M, K;) as also ↓ إِمْنٌ (Zj, M, K)
and ↓ أَمِنٌ (M, K) and ↓ أَمَنَهُ (S, M, K) [and
↓ إِمْنَةٌ (see أَمِنَ)] and ↓ أَمَانٌ and ↓ آمِنٌ, (M, K,)
which last is an inf. n. of أَمِنَ [like the rest],
(MF,) or a subst. like فَالِجٌ; (M;) and ↓ أَمَانَةٌ is
syn. with أَمَانٌ, (S,) both of these signifying
security, or safety, and freedom from fear: (PS:)
or أَمْنٌ signifies freedom from expectation of
evil, or of an object of dislike or hatred, in the
coming time; originally, ease of mind, and freedom from fear. (El-Munáwee, TA.) You say,
أَنْتَ فِى أَمْنٍ [Thou art in a state of security],
(T, M,) مِنْ ذَاكَ [from that]; and ↓ فى أَمَانٍ
signifies the same; (T;) and so ↓ فى آمِنٍ. (M.)
And نُعَاسًا ↓ أَمَنَةً, in the Kur [iii. 148], means
Security (أَمْنًا) [and slumber]. (S.) ↓ أَمَانٌ also
signifies Protection, or safeguard: and [very
frequently] a promise, or an assurance, of security
or safety; indemnity; or quarter: in Pers. پَنَاهْ
and زِنْهَارٌ: (KL:) syn. إِلُّ. (K in art. ال.) You
say, ↓ دَخَلَ فِى أَمَانِهِ [He entered within the pale
of his protection, or safeguard]. (S, Msb.) [And
اللّٰهِ ↓ كُنٌ فِى أَمَانِ Be thou in the protection, or
safeguard, of God.] And ↓ أَعْطَيْتُهُ الأَمَانَ [I
gave, or granted, to him security or safety, or
protection or safeguard, or the promise or assurance of security or safety, or indemnity, or
quarter]; namely, a captive. (Msb.) And طَلَبَ
↓ مِنْهُ الأَمَانَ [He asked, or demanded, of him
security or safety, or protection or safeguard,
&c., as in the next preceding ex.]. (Msb, TA.)
―
-b2-  أَمْنًا in the Kur ii. 119 means ذَا أَمْن [Possessed of security or safety]: (Aboo-Is-hák, M:)
or مَوْضِعَ أَمْنٍ [a place of security or safety; like
مَأْمَنًا]. (Bd.) ―
-b3-  See also آمِنٌ. ―
-b4-  You say also,

from fear, for himself: (M, K:) so says IAar. (M.)

who believes in everything that he hears; who
disbelieves in nothing: (Lh, T:) or in whom men,
or people, trust, or confide, and whose malevolence,
or mischievousness, they do not fear: (T, M:) and
↓ أُمَنَةٌ signifies trusted in, or confided in; [like
أَمِينٌ;] and by rule should be أُمْنَةٌ, because it has
the meaning of a pass. part. n. [like لُعْنَةٌ and
ضُحْكَةٌ and لُقْطَلةٌ &c. (see لَقَطٌ)]: (M:) or both
signify one in whom every one trusts, or confides,
in, or with respect to, everything. (K.) ―

عَصُوبٌ and حَلُوبٌ, (tropical:)  Trusted, or confided, in;
(T;) firmly, compactly, or strongly, made; (T,
S, M, K;) secure from, or free from fear of,

are guardians to my people: or, accord. to others,
this is pl. of ↓ آمِنٌ [app. in a sense mentioned

Hence,
أَلَمْ تَعْلَمِى يَا أَسْمَ وَيْحَكِ أَنَّنِى
حَلَفْتُ يَمِينًا لَا أَخُونُ أَمِينِى
[Knowest thou not, O Asmà (أَسْمَآء, curtailed for
the sake of the metre), mercy on thee! or woe to
thee! that I have sworn an oath that I will not
act treacherously to him in whom I trust?] i. e.
↓ مَأْمُونِى: (S:) or the meaning here is, him who
trusts, or confides, in me; (ISk, T;) [i. e.] it is
here syn. with ↓ آمِنِى. (M.) [Hence also,]
الأَمِينُ فِى القِمَارِ, (K voce مُجُمِدٌ, &c.,) or أَمِينُ,
القِمَارِ, [The person who is intrusted, as deputy,
with the disposal of the arrows in the game called
المَيْسِر; or] he who shuffles the arrows; الَّذِى.
يَضْرِبُ بِالقِدَاحِ. (EM p. 105.) [Hence also,]
الرُّوحُ الأَمِينُ [The Trusted, or Trusty, Spirit];
(Kur xxvi. 193;) applied to Gabriel, because he
is intrusted with the revelation of God. (Bd.)
↓ أُمَّانٌ, mentioned above, and occurring in a verse
of El-Aashà, applied to a merchant, is said by
some to mean Possessed of religion and excellence.
(M.) ↓ مُؤْتَمَنٌ is applied, in a trad., to the مُؤَذِّن,
as meaning that men trust, or confide, in him
with respect to the times in which he calls to
prayer, and know by his call what they are commanded to do as to praying and fasting and
breaking fast. (Mgh.) المُعَامَلَةِ ↓ هُوَ مَأْمُونُ

with others; or] free from exorbitance and deceit
or artifice or craft to be feared. (Msb.) ―

syn. قَوِىٌّ. (K, TA: [in the latter of which is
given the same reason for this signification as is

-b4-
One who trusts, or confides, in another; (ISk, T,
K;) [as also ↓ آمِنٌ, of which see an ex. voce حَذِرٌ;]

أَمَانَةُ اللّٰهِ [for أَمَانَةُ اللّٰهِ قَسَمِي or مَا أُقْسِمُ The
faithfulness of God is my oath or that by which
I swear] is composed of an inf. n. prefixed to the
agent, and the former is in the nom. case as an
inchoative; the phrase being like لَعَمْرُ اللّٰهِ, as
meaning an oath; and the enunciative being suppressed, and meant to be understood: accord. to
some, you say, أَمَانَةَ اللّٰهِ [app. for نَشَدْتُكَ أَمَانَةَ اللّٰهِ
I adjure thee, or conjure thee, by the faithfulness
of God, or the like], making it to be governed in
the accus. case by the verb which is to be understood: and some correctly say, وَأَمَانَةِ اللّٰهِ [By the
faithfulness of God], with the و which denotes
an oath: (Mgh:) or this last is an oath accord.
to Aboo-Haneefeh; but Esh-Sháfi'ee does not
reckon it as such: and it is forbidden in a trad. to
swear by الأَمَانَة; app. because it is not one of
the names of God. (TA.) [Or these phrases may
have been used, in the manner of an oath, agreeably with explanations here following.]
-A2-  A
thing committed to the trust and care of a person;
a trust; a deposite; (Mgh, Msb;) and the like:
(Msb:) property committed to trust and care:
(TA:) pl. أَمَانَاتٌ. (Mgh, Msb.) It is said in the
Kur [viii. 27], وَتَخُونُوا أَمَانَاتِكُمْ [Nor be ye
unfaithful to the trusts committed to you]. (Mgh.)
And in the same [xxxiii. 72], إِنَّا عَرَضْنَاالأَمَانَةَ عَلَى
السّموَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِوَالْجِبَالِ فَأَبَيْنَ أَنْ يَحْمِلْنَهَا وَأَشْفَقْنَ
مِنْهَا وَحَمَلَهَا الْإِنْسَانُ [Verily we proposed, or
offered, the trust which we have committed to
man to the heavens and the earth and the mountains, and (accord. to explanations of Bd and
others) they refused to take it upon themselves, or
to accept it, and they feared it, but man took it
upon himself, or accepted it: or, (accord. to
another explanation of Bd, also given in the T,
and in the K in art. حمل, &c.,) they refused to
be unfaithful to it, and they feared it, but man
was unfaithful to it: but in explaining what this
trust was, authors greatly differ: accord. to some,]
الامانة here means obedience; so called because
the rendering thereof is incumbent: or the obedience
which includes that which is natural and that
which depends upon the will: [for] it is said that
when God created these [celestial and terrestrial]
bodies, He created in them understanding: or it
may here [and in some other instances] mean
reason, or intellect: [and the faculty of volition:
and app. conscience: these being trusts committed
to us by God, to be faithfully employed: (see an
ex. voce جَذْرٌ:)] and the imposition of a task or
duty or of tasks or duties [app. combined with
reason or intellect, which is necessary for the
performance thereof]: (Bd:) or it here means
prayers and other duties for the performance of
which there is recompense and for the neglect of
which there is punishment: (Jel:) or, accord. to
I'Ab and Sa'eed Ibn-Jubeyr, (T,) the obligatory
statutes which God has imposed upon his servants:
(T, K: *) or, (T, K,) accord. to Ibn-'Omar, [the
choice between] obedience and disobedience was
offered to Adam, and he was informed of the
recompense of obedience and the punishment of
disobedience: but, in my opinion, he says, (T,)
it here means the intention which one holds in the
heart, (T, K,) with respect to the belief which he
professes with the tongue, and with respect to all
the obligatory statutes which he externally fulfils;
(K;) because God has confided to him power
over it, and not manifested it to any [other] of his
creatures, so that he who conceives in his mind,
with respect to the acknowledgment of the unity
of God, (T, K,) and with respect to belief [in
general], (T,) the like of that which he professes,
he fulfils the امانة [or trust], (T, K,) and he who
conceives in his mind disbelief while he professes
belief with the tongue is unfaithful thereto, and
every one who is unfaithful to that which is confided to him is [termed] حَامِلٌ, (T,) or حَامِلُ
الأَمَانَةِ, and مُحْتَمِلُهَا: (Bd:) and by الإِنْسَانُ is
here meant the doubting disbeliever. (T.) ―

A man's] family, or household; syn. أَهْلٌ. (TA.)

-A2-  Also One
who does not write; as though he were (كَأَنَّهُ [in
the CK لاَنَّهُ because he is]) an أُمِّى. (K, TA.)
[But this belongs to art. ام; being of the measure
فُعْلَانٌ, like عُرْيَانٌ.] ―
-b2-  And A sower, or cultivator of land; [perhaps meaning a clown, or
boor;] syn. زَرَّاعٌ: (CK:) or sowers, or cultivators
of land; syn. زُرَّاعٌ: (K, TA:) in one copy of the
K زِرَاع. (TA.)
آمِنٌ Secure, safe, or free from fear; as also
↓ أَمِينٌ (Lh, T, * S, * M, Msb, K) and ↓ أَمِنٌ. (M,
K.) Hence, in the Kur [xcv. 3], ↓ وَهذَا الْبَلَدِ الْأَمِينِ
[And this secure town]; (Akh, Lh, T, S, M;)
meaning Mekkeh. (M.) بَلَدٌ آمِنٌ and ↓ أَمِينٌ
means A town, or country, or district, of which
the inhabitants are in a state of security, or confidence, therein. (Msb.) It is also said in the
Kur [xliv. 51], ↓ إِنَّ الْمُتَّقِينَ فِي مَقَامٍ أَمِينٍ,
meaning [Verily the pious shall be in an abode]
wherein they shall be secure from the accidents,
or casualties, of fortune. (M.) [And hence,]
↓ الأَمِينُ is one of the epithets applied to God,
(Mgh, K,) on the authority of El-Hasan; (Mgh;)
an assertion requiring consideration: it may mean
He who is secure with respect to the accidents, or
casualties, of fortune: but see المُؤْمِنُ, which is
[well known as] an epithet applied to God. (TA.)
آمِنُ المَالِ means What is secure from being
slaughtered, of the camels, because of its being
highly prized; by المال being meant الإِبِل: or,
as some say, (tropical:)  what is highly esteemed, of property
of any kind; as though, if it had intellect, it
would feel secure from being exchanged. (M.)
You say, أَعْطَيْتُهُ مِنْ آمِنِ مَالِي, (K, TA, [in the
CK آمَنِ,]) meaning (tropical:)  I gave him of the choice,
or best, of my property; of what was highly
esteemed thereof; (K, TA;) and مَالِى ↓ مِنْ أَمْنِ
which Az explains as meaning of the choice, or
best, of my property. (TA: [in which is given
a verse cited by ISk showing that أَمْن, thus used,
is not a mistranscription for آمِن.]) And آمِنُ الحِلْمِ
means Steadfast in forbearance or clemency; of
whose becoming disordered in temper, and free
from self-restraint, there is no fear. (M.) ―

آمِينَ [in the CK, erroneously, آمِينُ] and
↓ أَمِينَ; (Th, T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K;) both
chaste and well known, (TA,) the latter of the
dial. of El-Hijáz, (Msb, TA,) as some say, (TA,)
[and this, though the less common, is the original
form, for] the medd in the former is only to give
fulness of sound to the fet-hah of the أ, (Th, M,
Msb, TA,) as is shown by the fact that there
is no word in the Arabic language of the measure
فَاعِيلٌ; (Msb, TA;) and some pronounce the
former آمِّينَ, (K,) which is said by some of the
learned to be a dial. var., (Msb,) but this is a
mistake, (S, Msb,) accord. to authorities of good
repute, and is one of old date, originating from
an assertion of Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà, [i. e. Th,]
that آمِينَ is like عَاصِينَ, by which he was falsely
supposed to mean its having the form of a pl.,
[and being consequently آمِّينَ,] (Msb, [and part
of this is said in the M,]) whereas he thereby
only meant that the م is without teshdeed, like
the ص in عَاصِينَ; (M;) beside that the sense
of قَاصِدِينَ [which is that of آمِّينَ, from أَمَّ,]
would be inconsistent after the last phrase of the
first chapter of the Kur [where آمينَ is usually
added]; (Msb;) and sometimes it is pronounced
with imáleh, [i. e. “émeena,”] as is said by ElWáhidee in the Beseet; (K;) but this is unknown in works on lexicology, and is said to be
a mispronunciation of some of the Arabs of the
desert of El-Yemen: (MF:) each form is indecl.,
(S,) with fet-h for its termination, like أَيْنَ and
كَيْفَ, to prevent the occurrence of two quiescent
letters together: (T, S, TA:) it is a word used
immediately after a prayer, or supplication: (S, *
M:) [it is best expressed, when occurring in a
translation, by the familiar Hebrew equivalent
Amen:] El-Fárisee says that it is a compound
of a verb and a noun; (M;) meaning answer
Thou me; [i. e. answer Thou my prayer;] (M,
Mgh;*) or O God, answer Thou: (Zj, T, Msb,
K:) or so be it: (AHát, S, Msb, K:) or so do Thou,
(K, TA,) O Lord: (TA:) it is strangely asserted
by some of the learned, that, after the Fátihah,
[or Opening Chapter of the Kur-án,] it is a prayer
which implies all that is prayed for in detail in
the Fátihah: so in the Towsheeh: (MF:) or
it is one of the names of God: (M, Msb, K:)
so says El-Hasan (M, Msb) El-Basree: (Msb:)
but the assertion that it is for يَا اَللّٰهُ [O God],
and that اسْتَجِبٌ [answer Thou] is meant to be
understood, is not correct accord. to the lexicologists; for, were it so, it would be with refa,
not nasb. (T.)
إِيمَانٌ [inf. n. of 4, q. v. ―
-b2-  Used as a simple
subst., Belief; particularly in God, and in his
word and apostles &c.: faith: trust, or confidence: &c.] ―
-b3-  Sometimes it means Prayer;
syn. صَلَاةٌ: as in the Kur [ii. 138], where it is
said, وَمَا كَانَ اللّٰهُ لِيُضِيعَ إِيَمانَكُمْ, (Bd, Jel, TA,)
i. e. [God will not make to be lost] your prayer
towards Jerusalem, (Bd, * Jel,) as some explain
it. (Bd.) ―
-b4-  Sometimes, also, it is used as meaning The law brought by the Prophet. (Er-Rághib,
TA.)
مَأْمَنٌ A place of security or safety or freedom
from fear; or where one feels secure. (M, TA.)
مُؤْمَنٌ pass. part. n. of آمَنَهُ. (T.) It is said
in the Kur [iv. 96], accord. to one reading, (T,
M,) that of Aboo-Jaafar El-Medenee, (T,) لَسْتَ
مُؤْمَنًا [Thou art not granted security, or safety,
&c.; or] we will not grant thee security, &c.
(T, M.)
مُؤْمِنٌ [act. part. n. of 4; Rendering secure,
&c.]. المُؤْمِنُ is an epithet applied to God;
meaning He who rendereth mankind secure from
his wronging them: (T, S:) or He who rendereth
his servants secure from his punishment: (M,
IAth:) i. q. المُهَيْمِنُ, (M,) which is originally
المُؤَأْمِنُ; [for the form مُفْعِلٌ is originally مُؤَفْعِلٌ;]
the second ء being softened, and changed into ى,
and the first being changed into ه: (S:) or the
Believer of his servants (Th, M, TA) the Muslims,
on the day of resurrection, when the nations shall
be interrogated respecting the messages of their
apostles: (TA:) or He who will faithfully perform to his servants what He hath promised
them: (T, TA:) or He who hath declared in his
word the truth of his unity. (T.) ―
-b2-  [Also Believing, or a believer; particularly in God, and
in his word and apostles &c.: faithful: trusting,
or confiding: &c.: see 4.]
