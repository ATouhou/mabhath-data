اذاإِذَا denotes a thing's happening suddenly, or unexpectedly; (Mughnee, K;) or one's experiencing
the occurrence of a thing when he is in a particular
state; (S;) like إِذٌ: (S voce إِذٌ:) it pertains
only to nominal phrases; does not require to
be followed by a reply, or the complement of
a condition; does not occur at the commencement
of a sentence; and signifies the present time,
(Mughnee, K,) not the future; (Mughnee;) as
in خَرَجْتُ فَإِذَا الأَسَدُ بالبَابِ [I went forth, and lo,
or behold, or there, or then, at that present time,
(accord. to different authorities, as will be seen
below,) the lion was at the door]; and (in the
saying in the Kur [xx. 21], TA,) فَإِذَا هِىَ حَيَّةٌ
تَسْعَى [And lo, or behold, &c., it was a serpent
running]; (Mughnee, K;) and in the saying,
خَرَجْتُ فَإِذَا زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ, which means I went forth,
and Zeyd presented himself to me suddenly, or
unexpectedly, at the time, by standing. (S, TA.)
Accord. to Akh, it is a particle, (Mughnee, K,)
and his opinion is rendered preferable by their
saying, خَرَجْتُ فَإِذَا إِنَّ زِيْداً بِالبَابِ  [I went forth,
and lo, or behold, verily Zeyd was at the door];
for [اذا cannot here be a noun governed in the
accus. case, as] what follows إِنَّ, which is with
kesr, does not govern what precedes it: (Mughnee:) accord. to Mbr, it is an adverbial noun of
place: accord. to Zj, an adverbial noun of time.
(Mughnee, K.) Ibn-Málik adopts the first of
these opinions; Ibn-'Osfoor, the second; (Mughnee;) and so El-Fenjedeehee; (TA;) and Z,
the third; and he asserts that its governing word
is a verb understood, derived from المُفَاجَأَةُ;
[agreeably with the explanation cited above from
the S;] but others hold that the word which
governs it in the accus. case is the enunciative,
which is either expressed, as in خَرَجْتُ فَإِذَا زَيْدٌ
جَالِسٌ [I went forth, and there, in that place,
or then, at that time, Zeyd was sitting], or meant
to be understood, as in فَإِذَا الأَسَدُ, i. e. حَاضِرٌ [And
there, or then, the lion was present]; or if it
be supposed to be [itself] the enunciative, its
governing word is مُسْتَقِرُّ or اِسْتَقَرَّ [understood]:
and in the last of the phrases here mentioned, it
may be an enunciative accord. to the opinion of
Mbr, the meaning being فَبِالْحَاضِرَةِ الأَسَدُ [And
among the things present was the lion]; but not
accord. to the opinion of Zj, because a noun signifying time cannot be the enunciative of one signifying a corporeal thing; nor accord to the opinion
of Akh, because a particle cannot be used to denote
the enunciative of such a thing; or, as signifying
time, it may be the enunciative of such a thing
if we suppose a prefixed noun to be suppressed,
the meaning of فَإِذَا الأَسَدُ being فَإِذاَ حُضُورُ الأَسَدِ
[And then was the presence of the lion]. (Mughnee.) You may say either خَرَجْتُ فَإِذَا زَيْدٌ جَالِسٌ
or جَالِساً [I went forth, and lo, or behold, &c.,
Zeyd was sitting or Zeyd was there sitting], with
the nom. as an enunciative and with the accus.
as a denotative of state. (Mughnee.) The Arabs
said, قَدْ كُنْتُ أَظُنُّ أَنَّ العَقْرَبَ أَشَدُّ لَسْعَةً مِنَ
الزُّنْبُورِ فَإِذاَ هُوَ هِى [I used to think that the
scorpion was more vehement in stinging than
the hornet, and lo, he is (as vehement as) she],
and also, فَإِذاَ هُوَ إِيَّاهَا, which Sb disallowed,
in contending with Ks, who allowed it, and
appealed for confirmation thereof to certain Arabs,
whose judgment was pronounced in his favour;
but it is said that they were bribed to give
this judgment, or that they knew the place which
Ks held in the estimation of Er-Rasheed; and
if the latter expression be of established authority,
it is irregular and unchaste. (Mughnee.) ―
-b2-  It
also denotes the complement of a condition, like
فَ, (S, Msb,) with which it is in this case syn.,
(Msb,) as in the words of the Kur [xxx. 35],
وَإِنْ تُصِبْهُمْ سَيِّئَةٌ بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ إِذَا هُمُ يَقْنَطُون
[And if an evil befall them for that which their
hands have sent before, (i. e. for sins which they
have committed,) then they despair]. (S, Msb.)
―
-b3-  It is also an adverbial noun denoting future
time, (S, Msb, Mughnee, K, *) and implying the
meaning of a condition, (Msb, Mughnee,) and
this is generally the case when it is not used
in the manner first explained above. (Mughnee.)
In this case it is not used otherwise than as
prefixed to a proposition, (S, Mughnee,) which is
always verbal, as in the words of the Kur [xxx. 24],
ثُمَّ إِذَا دَعَاكُمَ دَعْوَةً مِنَ الأَرْضِ إذَا أَنْتُمْ تَخْرُجُونَ
[Then, when He shall call you, or when He
calleth you, (for, as in Arabic, so in English,
a verb which is properly present is often tropically
future,) with a single call from out the earth,
lo, or behold, or then, ye shall come forth], in
which occur both the usages of اذا here mentioned;
(Mughnee;) and in the phrase, إِذَا جِئْتَ أَكْرَمْتُكَ
[When thou shalt come, I will treat thee with
honour]; (Msb;) and in the phrase, أَجِيْؤُكَ إِذَا
احْمَرَّالبُسْرُ [I will come to thee when the fullgrown unripe dates shall become red], and إِذَا قَدِمَ
فُلَانٌ [when such a one shall arrive], which shows
it to be a noun because this is equivalent to
يَوْمَ يَقْدَمُ فُلَانٌ [on the day when such a one
shall arrive]: (S:) or in the phrase قُمْ إِذَا احْمَرَّ
البُسْرُ [and in many other cases] it denotes time
divested of any accessory idea, the meaning being
[Arise thou] at the time of the full-grown unripe
dates' becoming red: and so in the saying of EshSháfi'ee, If a man were to say, أَنْتِ طَالِقٌ إِذَا لَمْ
أُطَلِّقْكِ, or مَتَى لم اطلّقك, [Thou art divorced
when I do not divorce thee,] and then be silent
for a time sufficient for the divorce to be pronounced therein, she would be divorced; but
should he make it dependent upon a thing in the
future, the divorce would be delayed to that time,
as if he said, اذا احمرّ البسر  [using it in the sense
first assigned to this phrase above]. (Msb.) The
verb after it is in most cases a pret.: in other
cases, an aor.: both occur in the saying of Aboo-Dhu-eyb,
وَ النَّفْسُ رَاغِبَةٌ إِذَا رَغَّبْتَهَا
وَإِذَا تُرَدُّ إِلَى قَلِيلٍ تَقْنَعُ
[And the soul is desirous when thou makest it
desirous; and when thou reducest it, or restrictest
it, to little, it is content]. (Mughnee.) When it
is immediately followed by a noun, as in [the
phrase in the Kur lxxxiv. 1,] إذَا السَّمَآءُ انْشَقَّتْ,
the noun is an agent with a verb suppressed,
explained by what follows it; contr. to the opinion
of Akh; (Mughnee;) the complete phrase being
إِذَا انْشَقَّتِ السَّمَآءُ انْشَقَّتْ [When the heaven shall
be cleft, (when) it shall be cleft]; and in like
manner, إِنْ, as in the saying, in the Kur [ix. 6],
وَ إِنْ أَحَدٌ مِنَ المُشْرِكِينَ اسْتَجَارَكَ. (I 'Akp. 123.)
And in the saying of the poet,
إِذَا بَاهِلِىٌّ تَحْتَهُ حَنْظَلِيَّةٌ
لَهُ وَلَدٌ مِنْهَا فَذَاكَ المُدَرَّعُ
كَانَ is meant to be understood after اذا [so that
the meaning is, When a Báhilee (a man of the
tribe of Báhileh) has, or shall have, as his wife a
Handhaleeyeh (a woman of the tribe of Handhaleh, who were renowned for generosity), he having
offspring from her, that (offspring) is, or will
be, the mail-clad]. (Mughnee.) ―
-b4-  Sometimes it
denotes past time, (Mughnee, K,) like as إِذْ sometimes denotes future time, (Mughnee,) as in [the
saying in the Kur lxii. 11,] وَ إِذَا رَأَوْا تِجَارَةً أَوْ لَهْواً
انْفَضُّوا إِلَيْهَا [And when they saw merchandise or
sport, they dispersed themselves to it]. (Mughnee,
K.) [Thus] it occurs in the place of إِذْ, like as إِذْ
occurs in the place of إِذَا. (TA.) ―
-b5-  And sometimes it denotes the present time; and this is after
an oath, as in [the phrase in the Kur xcii. 1,]
وَاللَّيْلِ إِذَا يَغْشَى [By the night when it covereth
with its darkness]. (Mughnee, K.) ―
-b6-  It also
occurs in the sense of the conditional إِنْ, as in
the saying, أُكْرِمُكَ إِذَا أَكْرَمْتَنِى, meaning إِنْ
أَكْرَمْتَنِى [I will treat thee with honour if thou
treat me with honour]: (T:) [for] what is possible is made dependent upon it as well as what is
known to be certain, as in the phrases, إِذَا جَآءَ زَيْدٌ
[If Zeyd come] and إِذَا جَآءَ رَأْسُ الشَّهْرِ [When the
beginning of the month shall come]; or, accord.
to Th, there is a difference between إِذَا and إِنْ;
(Msb;) the latter being held by him to denote
what is possible, and the former to denote what is
ascertained; so that one says, إِنْ جَآءَ زَيْدٌ and
إذَا جَآءَ رَأْسُ الشَّهرِ. (Msb in art. ان.) ―
-b7-  When a
verb in the first person sing. of the pret. is
explained by another verb after it immediately
preceded by إِذَا, [تَقُولُ is understood before the
former verb, and therefore] the latter verb must
be in the second pers. sing., as in لُجْتُهُ إِذَا أَدَرْتَهُ
فِى فيِكَ [meaning Thou sayest (of a thing) لُجْتُهُ
when, or if, thou hast turned it about in thy
mouth]. (MF in art. لوج. See also أَىْ; last
sentence but one.) ―
-b8-  It is sometimes redundant,
like as إِذْ is sometimes [accord. to some], as
in the saying of 'Abd-Menáf Ibn-Riba El-Hudhalee,
حَتَّى إِذَا أَسْلَكُوهُم فِى قُتَائِدَةٍ
شَلَّا كَمَا تَطْرُدُ الجَمَّالَةُ الشُّرُدَا
[Until they made them to pass along Kutáīdeh,
(here meaning a certain mountain-road so named,
S in art. قتد,) urging on, like as the owners, or
attendants, of camels drive those that take fright
and run away]; for it is the end of the poem: or
he may have abstained from mentioning the enunciative because of its being known to the hearer.
(S.) When إِذَا is preceded by حَتَّى, [as in this
instance,] it is generally held that اذا is not
governed by حتّى in the gen. case, but is still an
adverbial noun, حتّى being an inceptive particle
without government. (Mughnee.) ―
-b9-  As to what
it is that governs إِذَا in the accus. case, there are
two opinions; that it is its conditional proposition;
or a verb, or the like, in the complement thereof:
(Mughnee, K:) the former is the opinion of the
critical judges; so that it is in the predicament of
مَتَى and حَيْثُمَا and أَيَّانَ. (Mughnee.) ―
-b10-  Sometimes it is used so as not to denote a condition,
as in the words of the Kur [xlii. 35], وَإِذَا مَا
غَضِبُوا هُم يَغفِرُونَ [And when, or whenever, they
are angry, they forgive], in which it is an adverbial noun relating to the enunciative of the
inchoative after it; for if it denoted a condition,
and the nominal proposition were a complement,
it would be connected by فَ: and the same is the
case when it is used after an oath, as in an
ex. given above. (Mughnee.) ―
-b11-  See also what
follows.
إِذًا, (Msb, TA, the latter as on the authority of
Lth,) with tenween, (TA,) or إِذَن, (T, S, M,
Msb, Mughnee, K, the first as on the authority of
Lth,) written in the former manner, (TA,) or in
the latter, (T,) when connected with a following
proposition, (T, TA,) and in a case of pause
written ↓ إِذًا, (T, S, M, Msb, Mughnee, K, TA,)
and therefore the Basrees hold that in other cases
it should be written إِذًا, (Msb,) though El-Má-
zinee and Mbr hold that it should be in this case
also with ن, while Fr holds that it should be
written with ا; when it governs, and otherwise
with ن, in order to distinguish between it and
[the adverbial noun] إِذَا: (Mughnee:) a particle,
(S, Msb, Mughnee, TA,) accord. to the general
opinion; and accord. to this opinion, it is a simple
word, not compounded of إِذْ and أَنْ; and as
being simple, it is that which renders an aor.
mansoob, not أَنْ suppressed and meant to be
understood after it: some say that it is a noun:
(Mughnee:) [but a knowledge of its meaning is
necessary to the understanding of the reason given
for asserting it to be a noun.] It denotes a
response, or reply, corroborating a condition;
(Lth, T, TA;) or compensation, or the complement of a condition; (Msb;) or a response, or
reply, (Sb, S, Mughnee, K,) in every instance;
(TA;) and compensation, or the complement of a
condition, (Sb, S, M, Mughnee, K,) though not
always: (Mughnee, TA:) and its virtual meaning
is [Then; i. e., in that case; or] if the case, or
affair, be as thou hast mentioned, (M, K, TA,)
or as has happened: (M, TA:) [and hence,]
accord. to those who say that it is a noun, the
original form of the phrase إِذَنْ أُكْرِمَكَ [Then, or
in that case, or if the case be so, I will treat thee
with honour, said in reply to one who says “ I
will come to thee,”] is إِذَا جِئْتَنِى أُكرِمُكَ [When
thou shalt come to me, I will treat thee with
honour]; then the proposition [جئتنى] is thrown
out, and tenween [or ن] is substituted for it,
(Mughnee,) for which reason, and to distinguish
between it and [the adverbial] ن, the Koofees
hold that it should be written with إِذَا, (Msb,) and
أَنْ [preceded by يَجِبُ عَلَىَّ or the like] is suppressed and meant to be understood [as that which
renders the aor. mansoob; so that when one says
إِذَنْ أُكْرِمَكَ, it is as though he said إِذَا جِئْتَنِى
When thou shalt come to
me, it will be incumbent, or obligatory, on me to
treat thee with honour]. (Mughnee.) It renders
an aor. following it mansoob on certain conditions:
(Mughnee, TA:) to have this effect, the aor. must
have a future signification, (T, S, Mughnee, TA,)
not present: (TA:) يَجِبُ عَلَىَّ أَنْ أُكُرِمَكَ must commence the phrase
in which the aor. occurs; (Mughnee, TA;) [or,
in other words,] the aor. must not be syntactically
dependent upon what precedes اذا: (TA:) and
there must be nothing intervening between اذا and
the aor., (T, Mughnee, TA,) unless it is a particle,
(T,) or an oath, (T, Mughnee,) or the negative لَا:
(Mughnee:) therefore, to a person who says,
“To-night I will visit thee,” (S,) or who says,
“I will come to thee,” (Mughnee,) you say,
إِذَنْ أُكْرِمَكَ [Then, or in that case, &c., I will
treat thee with honour]; (T, S, Mughnee;) and
to one who says, “I will treat thee with honour,”
you say, إِذًا أَجِيْئَكَ [Then, or if the case be so, I
will come to thee]. (TA.) When the verb after
اذن has the present signification, it does not
govern: (S, Mughnee, TA:) therefore, to a person who says, “I love thee,” you say, إِذَنْ أَظُنُّكَ
[Then, or if the case be so, I think thee
veracious]; for this is a mere reply: (Mughnee:)
and to one talking to thee, إِذًا أَظُنُّكَ كَاذبًا [Then
I think thee to be lying]. (TA.) When it is put
in a middle place, (S,) not commencing the phrase,
(Mughnee,) the verb after it not being syntactically dependent upon what is before it, (S, TA,)
it does not govern: (S, Mughnee, TA:) therefore, to one who says, “I will come to thee,”
(Mughnee, TA,) you say, أَنَا إِذَنْ أُكْرِمُكَ [I, in
that case, will treat thee with honour]: (S, Mughnee, TA:) for اذن among the words which govern
verbs is likened to الظَّنُّ among those which
govern nouns: (S:) and when it is put at the
end, it does not govern; as when you say,
أُكرِْمُكَ [I will treat thee with honour in that
case]. (S.) The saying [of the poet, or rájiz],
لَا تَتْرُكَنِّى فِيهِمُ شَطِيرَا
إِنِّى إِذًا أَهْلِكَ أَوْ أَطِيرَا
is explained by regarding it as an instance of the
suppression of the enunciative of إِنّ, so that the
meaning is, إِنِّى لاَ أَقْدِرُ عَلَى ذٰلِكَ, and then a
new phrase commences [wherefore the verse means
Do not thou leave me among them remote, or
a stranger: verily I cannot endure that: in that
case I should perish, or I should flee]. (Mughnee.) When it is immediately preceded by a
conjunction such as وَ or فَ, the aor. may be
either marfooa or mansoob. (S, Mughnee.)
When a noun is introduced between it and the
aor., the latter is marfooa, (T, Mughnee,) as
in the saying, إِذَنْ أَخُوكَ يُكْرِمُكَ [Then, or in
that case, thy brother will treat thee with honour],
(T,) or إِذًا يَا عَبْدَ اللّٰهِ أُكُرِمُكَ [Then, or in that
case, O ‘Abd-Allah, I will treat thee with honour];
but Ibn-’Osfoor allows the intervention of an
adverbial noun [without annulling the government]; and Ibn-Bábshádh, that of the vocative,
and of a prayer; and Ks and Hishám, that of a
word governed by the verb; but Ks in this case
prefers nasb; and Hishám, refa. (Mughnee.)
When you put an oath in the place of the noun,
you make the aor. mansoob, as in the saying,
إِذًا وَ اللّٰهِ تَنَامَ [Then, or if the case be so, by
God, thou wilt sleep]: but if you prefix ل to
the verb with the oath, you make the aor. marfooa,
saying, إذَنْ وَاللّٰهِ لَتَنْدَهُم [Then, or if the case be
so, by God, assuredly thou wilt regret, or repent].
(T.) When you introduce a particle between it
and the aor., you make the latter either marfooa
or mansoob, saying, إِذَنْ لَا أُكْرِمُكَ and لَا أُكُرِمَكَ
[Then, or in that case, I will not treat thee with
honour]. (T.) ―
-b2-  Sometimes the ا is rejected,
and they say, ذَنْ لَا أَفُعَلُ [Then, (a word exactly
agreeing with ذَنْ in sound as well as in meaning,) or in that case, I will not do such a thing].
(M, K, * TA.) ―
-b3-  IJ relates, on the authority of
Khálid, that إِذًا is used in the dial. of Hudheyl
for إِذًا. (M.) ―
-b4-  إِذَنْ or إِذًا is mentioned and
explained in the S and K and TA in art. اذن,
and in the TA in باب الالف الليّنة also.]
