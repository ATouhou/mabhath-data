grieved, lamented, or regretted: and he was angry:
(Msb:) or he grieved exceedingly: and he was

grieving for a thing that has escaped; not in an
absolute sense: (MF:) or it properly signifies
the rising, or swelling, or mantling, of the blood
of the heart, from desire of vengeance; and when
this is against an inferior, it is anger; but when
against a superior, it is grief. (Er-Rághib.) Mo-
hammad, being asked respecting sudden death,
answered, saying, رَاحَةٌ لِلْمُؤْمِنِ وَأَخْذَةُ أَسَفٍ لِلْكَافِرِ,
