اتم1
أَتْمٌ, (M, K,) in, or in relation to, a سِقَآء [or
skin for water or milk], (TA,) signifies The
having two punctures of a seam (خُزْرَتَانِ) rent so
as to become one. (M, K.) You say, أَتَمَتِ القِرْبَةٌ,
aor.
اَتِمَ, inf. n. أَتْمٌ, The water-skin had its two
punctures (خزرتاها [or rather two of its punctures,
agreeably with the explanation of the inf. n. in
the M and K, as given above,]) rent so that they
became one. (TK.) ―
-b2-  [And hence,] The meeting
together of the مَسْلَكَانِ [or vagina and rectum]:
whence أَتُومٌ [q. v.] as an epithet applied to a
woman. (Ham p. 373.) ―
-b3-  [It seems to be indicated in the T, that one says, أَتِمَ النِسَآءُ, aor.
اَتَمَ,
and أَتَمَ, aor.
اَتِمَ; as meaning, or perhaps the former
only, The women assembled, or came together: for
I there find, immediately after مَأْتَمٌ as signifying
“a place in which women assemble,” “one says,
أَتِمَ, aor.
اَتَمَ, and أَتَمَ, aor.
اَتِمَ:” but it is then added
that, accord. to Khálid Ibn-Yezeed, مأتم is from
أَتِمَ, aor.
اَتَمَ.]
-A2-  I. q. فَتْقٌ [The act of rending,
rending asunder, ripping, or the like; or undoing
the sewing of a thing]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  The act of
cutting. (Sgh, K.) You say, أَتَمَهُ He cut it.
(TK.)
-A3-  أَتَمَ, aor.
اَتِمَ, also signifies He brought
together, or united, two things. (T.) [See أَتُومٌ,
and مَأْتَمٌ.]
-A4-  أَتَمَ بِالمَكَانِ, (Sgh, Msb,) with two
forms of aor., [app.
اَتِمَ and
اَتُمَ,] (Msb,) inf. n. أَتْمٌ,
(Sgh, K,) or أُتُومٌ; (Msb;) and أَتِمَ, aor.
اَتَمَ;
(Msb;) He stayed, remained, dwelt, or abode, in
the place. (Sgh, Msb, K.)

آتَمَهَا, inf. n. إِيتَآمٌ; and ↓ أَتَّمَهَا, inf. n. تَأْتِيمٌ;
He rendered her such as is termed أَتُوم, q. v.
(O, K.)
أَتُومٌ is primarily used in relation to the سِقآء
[or skin for water or milk; as meaning] Having
two punctures of a seam (خُرْزَتَانِ) rent so that
they become one. (S.) ―
-b2-  And hence, (S,) or from
أَتَمَ as meaning “he brought together, or united,”
two things, (T,) A woman whose مَسْلَكَانِ [or
vagina and rectum] meet together in one, [by the
rupture of the part between them,] (T, M,) becoming conjoined, so that the فَرْج is enlarged
thereby, (TA,) on the occasion of devirgination;
(M;) i. q. مُفْضَاةٌ, (T, S, M,) as some say; (T;)
or مُفَاضَةٌ; (K; [said in the TA to be a mistake:
but مُفْضَاةٌ and مُفَاضَةٌ are said in the M, in art.
فيض, to have the same signification;]) a woman
whose مَسْلَكَانِ have become one: (Ham p. 271:)
or, as some say, small in the فَرْجَ [or vagina]:
(M:) or it has these two contr. significations.
(K.)
مَأْتَمٌ is a quasi-inf. n. of أَتَمَ in the last of the
senses explained above. (Msb.) [Thus it signifies
A staying, remaining, dwelling, or abiding, in
a place. But it more commonly signifies] The
assembling of women [and of men also] in a case
of rejoicing and of mourning. (Har p. 234.) ―
-b2-
It is also a noun of time from the same. (Msb.)
[Thus it signifies A time of staying or remaining, &c.] ―
-b3-  And it is also a noun of place from
the same. (Msb.) [And thus it signifies A place
of staying or remaining, &c. But it more commonly signifies] A place of assembling of women
[and of men also] in a case of rejoicing and of
mourning: from أَتِمَ, aor.
اَتَمَ, accord. to Khálid
Ibn-Yezeed. (T.) ―
-b4-  And hence, tropically, (Msb,)
(tropical:)  Women assembling together (T, S, M, Mgh,
Msb, K) in a case of rejoicing and of mourning,
(T, M, Mgh, K,) or in a case of good and of evil:
(S, Msb:) or any assembly, (M, K,) of men and
of women, (M,) in a case of mourning or of rejoicing: (M, K:) or particularly of young women;
(M, K,) accord. to some; but it is not so: and
some assert that the word is derived from أَتْمٌ, in
the first of the senses explained in this art.; and
from أَتُومٌ, as an epithet applied to a woman;
because it signifies women coming together, and
meeting face to face, in a case of good and of evil:
(M:) the pl. is مَآتِمُ. (S, Mgh.) Abu-l-'Atà
Es-Sindee says,
عَشِيَّةَ قَامَ النَّائِحَاتُ وَ شُقِّقَتْ
جُيُوبٌ بِأَيْدِى مَأْتَمٍ وَ خُدُودُ
[In the evening when arose the wailing women to
wail, and openings at the necks and bosoms of
garments were rent with the hands of assembled
mourning women, and cheeks also were lacerated]:
(S, M, Mgh:) i. e., بِأَيْدِى نِسَآءٍ. (S.) And
another says,
حَتَّى تَرَاهُنَّ لَدَيْهِ قُيَّمَا
كَمَا تَرَى حَوْلَ الأَمِيرِ المأْتَمَا
[So that thou seest them (referring to women)
standing in his presence, or at, or by, it, like as
thou seest the assembly of men around the prince,
or commander]: المأتم here necessarily denoting
men. (M.) ―
-b5-  IKt says, (Msb,) it is used by
the vulgar to denote An affliction, or evil accident; (S, Mgh, Msb;) [and Mtr adds,] and a
wailing: (Mgh:) they say, كُنَّا فِى مَإْتَمِ فَلَانٍ
[meaning We were present at the affliction of
such a one]: (S, Msb:) or كُنَّا فِى مَأْتَمِ بَنِي فُلَلنٍ
[meaning, We were present at the affliction, and
wailing, of the sons of such a one]: (Mgh:) but
the correct word in this case, (S, Mgh,) or the
better, (Msb,) is مَنَاحَة: (S, Mgh, Msb:) so says
IAmb. (Mgh.) But accord. to IB, nothing forbids that it may occur in the sense of A place
of wailing; and in the sense of mourning, and
wailing, and weeping; for therefore do women
assemble: and thus it may be in the saying of
Et-Teymee, respecting Mansoor Ibn-Ziyád,
وَ النَّاسُ مَأْتَمُهُمْ عَلَيْهِ وَاحِدٌ
فِى كلِّ دَارٍ رَنَّةٌ وَ زَفِيرُ
[The people's mourning, &c., for him was one: in
every house was a moaning, and a sighting]: and
in the saying of another,
أَضْحَى بَنَاتُ السُّبِىِّ إِذْ قُتِلُوا
فِى مَأْتَمٍ وَالسِّبَاعُ فِى عُرُسِ
i. e. [The daughters of the captives, when they
were slain, became, in the early part of the day,]
in a state mourning; and the beasts of prey,
in a state of rejoicing. (TA.)
