أَلَقَ, (JK, K, TA,) aor.
اَلِقَ; (K, TA;) or
أَلِقَ, aor.
اَلَقَ; (CK; [in which it would seem,
from what follows in this paragraph and the next,
that the pret. is wrong, but that the aor. is
right;]) inf. n. أَلْقٌ and إِلَاقٌ; (JK, K;) It
(lightning) lied; (AHeyth, K;) [i. e.] it was

اَلَقَ, inf. n. أَلْقٌ, He lied; spoke falsely:
whence the reading of Aboo-Jaafar and Zeyd

تألّق [When ye spoke it falsely with your
tongues]. (TA.)

اَلَقَ.
(TA.) Ibn-Ahmar has made the second trans.,
using the phrase العُيُونَ ↓ تَأْتَلِقُ, either by suppressing a prep., [meaning She shines to the eyes,] or
meaning thereby she ravishes the eyes. (TA.) ―
-b2-
And تَأَلَّقَتٌ, said of a woman, She adorned
herself: (Sgh, K:) or she became active and

but قِرْدٌ, (S, K,) and رُبَّاحٌ. (S.) ―
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  Evil in
disposition, applied to a man; and so with ة
applied to a woman: and the latter, a [demon
of the kind called] سِعْلَاة; because of its evil,
or malignant, nature: (TA:) and a bold woman;
(Lth, K;) for the same reason. (TA.)

no rain; (JK, K;) as also ↓ أَلَّاقٌ: (K, * TA:)
↓ آلِقٌ, likewise, is an epithet applied to lightning
[in the same sense; or as signifying shining,
gleaming, or glistening: see 1 and 5]: and so is

rain, but deceives the expectation]. (TA.) ―
