اجصإِجَّاصٌ [The plum;] a certain fruit, (K, TA,)
of the description termed فَاكِهَة, (TA,) well known;
(Msb, K;) cold and moist; or, as some say, of
moderate temperature; (TA;) which facilitates
the flow of the yellow bile; (K;) i. e., its juice, or
water, does so, when drunk with sugar-candy
(طَبَرْزَذ) and manna (تَرَنْجُبِين) added to it;
(TA;) and allays thirst, and heat of the heart;
(K;) but it relaxes the stomach, and does not
agree with it; and it generates a watery mixture;
and its injurious effect is repelled by the drinking
of sugary سِكَنْجُبِين [or oxymel]: it is of several
kinds: (TA:) [the most common is the Damasc,
or Damascene, plum:] the best is (K, TA) the
Armenian, (TA,) that which is sweet and large:
(K, TA:) the sour, or acid, is less laxative, and
more cold: (TA:) the n. un. is with ة: (S, Msb,
K:) you should not say إِنْجَاصٌ; (Yaakoob, S,
K;) or this is a word of weak authority, (K, TA,)
and you say إِجَّاصٌ and إِنجَاصٌ like as one says
إِجَّارٌ and إِنْجَارٌ: (TA:) in the dial. of the Syrians,
the إِجَّاصٌ [or إِنْجَاص or إِنجَاس accord. to common modern usage among them] is the [pear
which they formerly called] مِشْمِش and [which
others call] كُمَّثْرَي: (K:) it is of the growth of
the country of the Arabs: (AHn:) اجّاص is an
adventitious word, (S, K,) or arabicized, (Msb,)
because ج and ص do not both occur in any
Arabic word: (S, Msb, K:) or, accord. to Az,
they do so occur; as, for instance, in حَصَّصَ, and
in صَجٌّ. (TA.)
