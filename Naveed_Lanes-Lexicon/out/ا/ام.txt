And رَسُولَ اللّٰهِ ↓ انْطَلَقْتُ أَتَأَمَّمُ, in another trad.,
I went away, betaking myself to the Apostle of
God. (TA.) Hence, also, الصَّعِيدَ لِلصَّلَاهِ ↓ تَيَمَّمَ
[He betook himself to dust, or pure dust, to wipe
his face and his hands and arms therewith, for
prayer]: (T, * M, * Mgh, TA:) as in the Kur

as meaning the wiping the face and the hands and
arms with dust; (ISk, T, * M, * Mgh, TA;) i. e.

it seems to be indicated that this is a simple
subst.,]) He preceded them; went before them;

as إِمَام [q. v.] with him. (Msb.) And أَمَّ الصُّفُوفَ
He became [or acted as] إِمَام to the people composing the ranks [in a mosque &c.]. (Har p. 680.)
You say also, لَا يَؤُمُّ الرَّجُلُ الرَّجُلَ فِى سُلْطَانِهِ [A
man shall not take precedence of a man in his
authority]; meaning, in his house, and where he
has predominance, or superior power, or authority;
nor shall he sit upon his cushion; for in doing so
he would show him contempt. (Mgh in art. سلط.)

اَمُ3َ,
(M,) inf. n. أُمُومَةٌ, (M, K,) She (a woman, S)

أُمُومَةٌ. (S, M, K.) ―
-b2-  أَمَمْتُهُ I was to him a mother. (A in art. ربض.) IAar, speaking of a
woman, said, كَانَتْ لَهَا عَمَّةٌ تَؤُمُّهَا, meaning [She
had, lit. there was to her, a paternal aunt] who
was to her like the mother. (M.)

أَمَّمَهُ and
يَمَّمَهُ: see 1, first sentence, in two
places.
3
آمّهُ It agreed with it, neither exceeding nor
falling short. (M.) ―
-b2-  [See also the part. n.
مُؤَامٌّ, voce أَمَمٌ; whence it seems that there are
other senses in which آمَّ may be used, intransitively.]

تَأَمَّمَ and
تَيَمَّمَ: see 1, former part, in four
places.
-A2-  تأمّم بِهِ: see 8.
-A3-  تَمَّمْتُ I took for
myself, or adopted, a mother. (S.) And تَأَمَّمَهَا
He took her for himself, or adopted her, as a
mother; (S, * M, K;) as also ↓ استآمّها, (M, K,)
and تَأَمَّهَهَا. (M.)
8
ائتمّهُ [written with the disjunctive alif
اِيتَمَّهُ]: see 1, first sentence.
-A2-  ائتمّ بِهِ He followed his example; he imitated him; he did as
he did, following his example; or taking him as
an example, an exemplar, a pattern, or an object
of imitation; (S, Mgh, Msb;) as also ↓ أَمَّهُ: (Bd
in xvi. 121:) the object of the verb is termed
إِمَامٌ; (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K;) applied to a learned
man, (Msb,) or a head, chief, or leader, or some
other person. (M, K.) He made it an أُمَّة or إِمَّة
[i. e. a way, course, or rule, of life or conduct;
as explained immediately before in the work
whence this is taken]; as also به ↓ تأمّم. (M.)
You say, ائتمّ بِالشَّيْءِ and ائْتَمَى به, by substitution [of ى for م], (M, K,) disapproving of the
doubling [of the م]. (M.)
10
إِسْتَاْمَ3َ see 5.
أَمْ is a conjunction, (S, M, K,) connected with
what precedes it (Msb, Mughnee) so that neither
what precedes it nor what follows it is independent, the one of the other. (Mughnee.) It
denotes interrogation; (M, K;) or is used in a
case of interrogation, (S, Msb,) corresponding to
the interrogative أَ, and meaning أَىّ, (S,) or, as
Z says, أَىُّ الأَمْرَيْنِ كَائِنٌ; [for an explanation of
which, see what follows;] (Mughnee;) or, [in
other words,] corresponding to the interrogative أَ,
whereby, and by أَمْ, one seeks, or desires, particularization: (Mughnee:) it is as though it were
an interrogative after an interrogative. (Lth, T.)
Thus you say, أَزَيُدٌ فِى الدَّارِ أَمْ عَمْرٌو [Is Zeyd in
the house, or 'Amr?]; (S, Mughnee;) i. e. which
of them two (أَيُّهُمَا) is in the house? (S;) therefore what follows ام and what precedes it compose
one sentence; and it is not used in commanding
nor in forbidding; and what follows it must correspond to what precedes it in the quality of noun
and of verb; so that you say, أَزَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ أَمع قَاعِدٌ
[Is Zeyd standing, or sitting?] and أَقَامَ زَيْدٌ أَمْ
قَعَدَ [Did Zeyd stand, or sit?]. (Msb.) It is not
to be coupled with أَ after it: you may not say,
أَعِنْدَكَ زَيْدٌ أَمْ أَعِنْدَكَ عَمْرٌو. (S.) ―
-b2-  As connected
in like manner with what goes before, it is preceded by أَ denoting equality [by occurring after
سَوَآءٌ &c.], and corresponds thereto, as in [the Kur
lxiii. 6,] سَوَآءُ عَلَيْهِمْ أَسْتَغْفَرْتَ لَهُمٌ لَمٌ تَسْتَغُفِرْ لَهُمٌ
[It will be equal to them whether thou beg forgiveness for them or do not beg forgiveness for them].
(Mughnee.) ―
-b3-  It is also unconnected with what
precedes it, (S, Msb, Mughnee,) implying always
digression, (Mughnee,) preceded by an enunciative, or an interrogative, (S, Msb, Mughnee,)
other than أَ, (Mughnee,) or by أَ not meant
[really] as an interrogative but to denote disapproval, (Mughnee,) and signifies بَلْ, (Lth, Zj,
T, S, M, Mughnee, K,) or بَلْ and أَ together,
(Msb,) and this is its meaning always accord.
to all the Basrees, but the Koofees deny this.
(Mughnee.) Thus, using it after an enunciative,
you say, إِنَّهَا لَإِبِلٌ أَمْ شَآءٌ [Verily they are camels:
nay, or nay but, they are sheep, or goats: or nay,
are they sheep, or goats?]: (S Msb, Mughnee:)
this being said when one looks at a bodily form,
and imagines it to be a number of camels, and
says what first occurs to him; then the opinion
that it is a number of sheep or goats suggests
itself to him, and he turns from the first idea, and
says, أَمْ شَآءٌ, meaning بَلْ, because it is a digression
from what precedes it; though what follows بل
is [properly] a thing known certainly, and what
follows ام is opined. (S, TA.) And using it after
an interrogative in this case, you say, هَلْ زيْدٌ
مُنْطَلِقٌ أَمْ عَمْرٌو [Is Zeyd going away? Nay
rather, or, or rather, is 'Amr?]: you digress from
the question respecting Zeyd's going away, and
make the question to relate to 'Amr; so that ام
implies indecisive opinion, and interrogation, and
digression. (S.) And thus using it, you say, هَلْ زَيْدٌ
قَامَ أَمْ عَمْرٌو [Did Zeyd stand? Nay rather, or
or rather, did 'Amr?]. (Msb.) And an ex. of
the same is the saying [in the Kur xiii. 17],
هَلْ يَسْتَوِى الْأَعْمَى وَالْبَصِيرُ أَمْ هَلْ تَسْتَوِى الظُّلُمَاتُ
وَالنُّورُ [Are the blind and the seeing equal? Or
rather are darkness and light equal?]. (Mughnee.)
And an ex. of it preceded by أَ used to denote
disapproval is the saying [in the Kur vii. 194],
أَلَهُمْ أَرْجُلٌ يَمْشُونَ بِهَا أَمْ لَهُمْ أَيْدٍ يَبْطِشُونَ بِهَا [Have
they feet, to walk therewith? Or have they hands
to assault therewith?]: for أَ is here equivalent to
a negation. (Mughnee.) [It has been shown
above that] أَمْ is sometimes introduced immediately before هَلْ: (S, K:) but IB says that this
is when هل occurs in a phrase next before it; [as
in the ex. from the Kur xiii. 17, cited above;]
and in this case, the interrogative meaning of ام
is annulled; it being introduced only to denote a
digression. (TA.) ―
-b4-  It is also used as a simple
interrogative; accord. to the assertion of AO; in
the sense of هَلْ; (Mughnee;) or in the sense of
the interrogative أَ; (Lth, T, K) as in the saying,
أَمْ عِنْدَكَ غَدَآءِ حَاضِرٌ, meaning Hast thou a morning-meal ready? a good form of speech used by
the Arabs; (Lth, T;) and allowable when preceded by another phrase. (T.) ―
-b5-  And sometimes
it is redundant; (AZ, T, S, Mughnee, K) in the
dial. of the people of El-Yemen; (T;) as in the
saying,
يَا دَهْنَ أَمْ مَا كَانَ مَشْيِى رقَصَا
بَلْ قَدْ تَكُونُ مِشْيَتِى تَوَقُّصَا
(T, S, * [in the latter, يا هِنْدُ, and only the former
hemistich is given,]) meaning O Dahnà, (the
curtailed form دَهْنَ being used for دَهْنَآء,) my
walking was not, as now in my age, [a feeble
movement like] dancing: but in my youth, my
manner of walking used to be a bounding: (T:)
this is accord. to the opinion of AZ: but accord.
to another opinion, ام is here [virtually] conjoined
with a preceding clause which is suppressed; as
though the speaker had said, يَا دَهْنَ أَكَانَ مَشْيِى
رَقَصَّا أَمْ مَا كَانَ كَذلِكَ. (A 'Hát, TA.)
-A2-  It is
also used (T, Mughnee) in the dial. of the people
of El-Yemen, (T,) or of Teiyi and Himyer,
(Mughnee,) in the sense of ال, (T,) to render a
noun determinate. (Mughnee.) So in the trad.,
لَيْسَ مِنَ امْبِرّ امْصِيامُ فِى امْسَفَرِ, (T, Mughnee,)
i. e. الَيْسَ مِنَ البِرِّ الصِّيَامُ فِى السَّفَرِ [Fasting in
journeying is not an act of obedience to God].
(T, and M in art. بر.) So too in the trad., اَلْآنَ
طَابَ امْضَرْبُ Now fighting has become lawful;
as related accord. to the dial. of Himyer, for
الضَّرْبُ. (TA in art. طيب.) It has been said that
this form ام is only used in those cases in which
the ل of the article does not become incorporated
into the first letter of the noun to which it is prefixed; as in the phrase, خُذِ الرُّمْحَ وَارْكَبِ امْفَرَسَ
[Take thou the spear, and mount the mare, or
horse], related as heard in El-Yemen; but this
usage may be peculiar to some of the people of
that country; not common to all of them; as
appears from what we have cited above. (Mughnee.)
-A3-  أَمَ for أَمَا, before an oath: see art. اما.
-A4-  And أَمَ اللّٰهِ and أَمُ اللّٰهِ &c.: see أَيْمُنُ اللّٰهِ, in
art. يمن.
أُمٌّ A mother (T, S, M, Msb, K, &c.) [of a
human being and] of any animal; (IAar, T;)
as also ↓إِمٌّ, (Sb, M, Msb, K) and ↓إُمَّةٌ, (T,
M, Msb, K,) and ↓أُمَّهَةٌ, (S, M, Msb, K,) which
last is the original form (S, Msb) accord. to
some, (Msb,) or the ه in this is augmentative (M,
Msb) accord. to others: (Msb:) the pl. is أُمَّهَاتٌ
(Lth, T, S, M, Msb, K) and أُمَّاتٌ; (S, M, Msb,
K;) or the former is applied to human beings,
and the latter to beasts; (T, S;) or the former to
rational beings, and the latter to irrational; (M,
K;) or the former is much applied to human
beings, and the latter to others, for the sake
of distinction; (Msb;) but the reverse is sometimes the case: (IB:) IDrst and others hold
the latter to be of weak authority: (TA:) the
dim. of أُمٌّ is ↓ أُمَيْمَةٌ (T, S, K) accord. to some
of the Arabs; but correctly, [accord. to those
who hold the original form of أُمٌّ to be أُمَّهَةٌ,]
it is ↓ أُمَيْمِهَةٌ. (Lth, T, TA. [In a copy of the
T, I find this latter form of the dim. written
اميهة.]) ―
-b2-  أُمَّ لَكَ denotes dispraise; (S;) being
used by the Arabs as meaning Thou hast no
free, or ingenuous, mother; because the sons
of female slaves are objects of dispraise with the
Arabs; and is only said in anger and reviling:
(A Heyth, T:) or, as some say, it means thou
art one who has been picked up as a foundling,
having no Known mother: (TA:) [or] it is also
sometimes used in praise; (A 'Obeyd, T, S, K;)
and is used as an imprecation without the desire
of its being fulfilled upon the person addressed,
being said in vehemence of love; [lit. meaning
mayest thou have no mother!], like ثَكِلَتْكَ أُمُّكَ,
and لَا أَبَا لَكَ, [and قَاتَلَكَ اللّٰهُ,] &c. (Har p. 165.)
―
-b3-  Some elide the ا of أُمّ; as in the saying of
'Adee Ibn—Zeyd.
أَيُّهَا العَائِبُ عِنْدِمَّ زَيْدٍ
[O thou who art blaming in my presence the
mother of Zeyd]; meaning, عِنْدِى أُمَّ زَيْدٍ; the
ى of عندى being also elided on account of the
occurrence of two quiescent letters [after the
elision of the ا of أُمّ]: (Lth, T, S:) and as in
the phrase وَيْلُمِّهِ, (S,) which means وَيْلٌ لِأُمِّهِ.
(S, and K in art. ويل, q. v.) ―
-b4-  هُمَا أُمَّاكّ means
They two are thy two parents: or thy mother
and thy maternal aunt. (K.) [But] فَدَّاهُ بِأُمَّيْهِ
is said to mean [He expressed a wish that he
(another) might be ransomed with] his mother
and his grandmother. (TA.) ―
-b5-  One says also,
لَا تَفْعَلِى ↓ يَا أُمَّتِ [O my mother, do not thou
such a thing], and [in like manner] يَا أَبَتِ افْعَلْ;
making the sign of the fem. gender a substitute
for the [pronominal] affix ى; and in a case
of pause, you say يَا أُمَّهْ. (S.) ―
-b6-  And one says,
مَا أُمِّى وَأُمُّهُ, and مَا شَكْلِى وَشَكْلُهُ, meaning [What
relationship have I to him, or it? or what concern
have I with him, or it? or] what is my case
and [what is] his or its, case? because of his,
or its, remoteness from me: whence, (T,)
وَمَا أُمِّى وَأُمُّ الوَحْشِ لَمَّا
تَفَرَّعَ فِى مَفَارِقِىَ الْمَشِيبُ
[And what concern have I with the wild animals
when hoariness hath spread in the places where
my hair parts?]; (T, S;) i. e. مَا أَنَاوَطَلَبُ
الوَحْشِ بَعْدَ مَا كَبِرْتُ [i. e. مَا أمْرِي وَطَلَبُ الوَحْشِ:
in one copy of the S, وَطَلَبَ, i. e. with وَ as a
prep. denoting concomitance, and therefore governing the accus. case: both readings virtually
meaning what concern have I with the pursuing
of the wild animals after I have grown old?]:
he means, the girls: and the mention of أُمّ in
the verse is superfluous. (S.) ―
-b7-  أُمٌّ also relates
to inanimate things that have growth; as in
أُمُّ الشَّجَرَةِ [The mother of the tree]; and أُمُّ النَّخْلَةِ
[the mother of the palm-tree]; and أُمُّ المَوْزِةَ [the
mother of the banana-tree; of which see an ex.
in art. موز]; and the like. (M, TA.) ―
-b8-  And
it signifies also The source, origin, foundation,
or basis, (S, M, Msb, K,) of a thing, (S, Msb,
[in the former of which, this is the first of the
meanings assigned to the word,]) or of anything;
(M, K) its stay, support, or efficient cause of
subsistence. (M, K.) ―
-b9-  Anything to which other
things are collected together, or adjoined: (IDrd,
M, K:) anything to which the other things that
are next thereto are collected together, or adjoined:
(Lth, T:) the main, or chief, part of a thing;
the main body thereof: and that which is a compriser, or comprehender, of [other] things: (Ham
p. 44:) the place of collection, comprisal, or comprehension, of a thing; the place of combination
thereof. (En-Nadr, T.) ―
-b10-  And hence, (IDrd,
M,) The head, or chief, of a people, or company
of men; (IDrd, S, M, K;) because others collect
themselves together to him: (IDrd, TA:) so
in the phrase أُمُّ عِيَالٍ [lit. the mother of a household], in a poem of Esh-Shenfarà: (IDrd, M:)
or in this instance, it has the signification next
following, accord. to Esh-Sháfi'ee. (T.) ―
-b11-  A
man who has the charge of the food and service
of a people, or company of men; accord. to EshSháfi'ee: (T:) or their servant. (K.) ―
-b12-  A
man's aged wife. (IAar, T, K.) ―
-b13-  A place of
habitation or abode. (K.) So in the Kur [ci. 6],
فَأُمُّهُ هَاوِيَةٌ His place of habitation or abode [shall
be] the fire [of Hell]: (Bd, Jel, TA:) or, as
some say, the meaning is أُمُّ رَأْسِهِ هَاوِيَةٌ فِيهَا [his
brain shall fall into it, namely, the fire of Hell].
(TA.) ―
-b14-  The ensign, or standard, which an army
follows. (S.) [See أُمُّ الرُّمْحِ, below.] ―
-b15-  It is said
in a trad., respecting the prophets, أُمَّهَا تُهُمْ شَتَّى,
meaning that, though their religion is one, their
laws, or ordinances, or statutes, are various, or
different: or the meaning is, their times are
various, or different. (TA in art. شت.) ―
-b16-  See
also أُمَّةٌ, in two places. ―
-b17-  أُمّ is also prefixed to
nouns significant of many things. (M.) [Most
of the compounds thus formed will be found
explained in the arts. to which belong the nouns
that occupy the second place. The following are
among the more common, and are therefore here
mentioned, with the meanings assigned to them
in lexicons in the present art., and arranged in
distinct classes.] ―
-b18-  أُمُّ الرَّجُلِ The man's wife;
and the person who manages the affairs of his
house or tent. (TA.) And أُمُّ مَثْوَى الرَّجُلِ The
man's wife, to whom he betakes himself for lodging,
or abode: (T:)  the mistress of the man's place
of abode. (S, M.) ―
-b19-  أُمُّ عَامِرٍ The hyena, or
female hyena; as also أُمُّ عَمْرٍو; (TA;) and
أُمُّ الطَّرِيقِ. (S, TA. [See also other significations
of the first and last below.]) أُمُّ حِلْسٍ [or أُمُّ الحِلْسِ
(as in the S and K in art. حلَس)] The she-ass.
(TA.) أُمُّ البَيْضِ The female ostrich. (S, K.)
―
-b20-  أُمُّ الرَّأُسِ The brain: (T, M, K:) or  the thin
skin that is upon it: (IDrd, M, K:) or the bag
in which is the brain: (T:) or the skin that
comprises the brain; [the meninx, or dura mater
and pia mater;] (S, Mgh;) which is called
أُمُّ الدِّمَاغِ (S, Msb) likewise. (S.) ―
-b21-  أُمُّ النُّجُومِ
The Milky way; (S, M, K) because it is the
place where the stars are collected together [in
great multitude]: (M:) or, as some say, the sun;
which is the greatest of the stars. (Ham pp. 43
and 44.) Because of the multitude of the stars
in the Milky way, one says, مَا أَشْبَهَ مَجْلِسَكَ بِأُمِّ
النُّجُومِ (assumed tropical:)  [How like is thine assembly to the Milky
way!]. (TA.) ―
-b22-  أُمُّ القُرَى [The mother of the
towns; the metropolis: particularly] Mekkeh;
(T, S, M, K) because asserted to be in the
middle of the earth; (M, K;) or because it
is the Kibleh of all men, and thither they repair;
(M, K; *) or because it is the greatest of towns
in dignity: (M, K:) and every city is the أُمّ of
the towns around it. (T.) أُمُّ التَّنَائِفِ The most
difficult of deserts or of waterless deserts: (T:)

or track, with small roads or tracks around it
[or on either side], the greatest is so called. (T.

of graves. (T. [This, also, has another signification, mentioned before.]) أُمُّ الرُّمْحِ The ensign,

الكِتَابِ [in the Kur iii. 5 and xiii. 39] (S, M, &c.)
The original of the book or scripture [i. e. of the
Kur-án]: (Zj, M, K:) or  the Preserved Tablet,

أَمَّةٌ: see آمَّةٌ.
أُمَّةٌ A way, course, mode, or manner, of acting,

M, K;) as also ↓ إِمَّةٌ. (M, K.) ―

has no religion; no religious persuasion. (S.)

an infidel equal?]. (S.) ―

God]. (T, M, K.)

the followers of the prophet: pl. أُمَمٌ. (T, Msb.)
It is said in the Kur [ii. 209], كَانَ النَّاسُ أُمَّةٍ واحِدَةً,
meaning Mankind was [a people] of one religion.

so explained by Ibn-Mes'ood as applied to Abraham: (TA:) or, so applied, it has the signification

syn. قَامَةٌ; (T, S, M, Msb, K;) and شَطَاطً: (M,
TA: [in the K, the signification of نَشَاطٌ is
assigned to it; but this is evidently a mistake for
شَطَاطٍ; for the next three significations before the
former of these words in the K are the same as
the next three before the latter of them in the M;
and the next five after the former word in the K
are the same as the next five after the latter in the
M, with only this difference, that one of these five
is the first of them in the M and the third of them
in the K:]) pl. أُمَمٌ. (T, S, M. *) You say, إِنَّهُ
لَحَسَنُ الأُمَّةِ, i. e. الشَّطَاطِ [Verily he is beautiful

long period of time: but some read ↓ إِمَّةٍ, i. e.,

هُوَ أَمَمٌ مِنْكَ He, or it, is near to thee: and in

form] like مُضَارٌّ, (S,) originally مُؤَامِمٌ, (TA,) the
same; (T;) of a middle, or middling, kind  or
sort; neither exceeding, nor falling short of, what
is right; (AA, T, S, M;) applied to an affair, or

affair, or a case, that is manifest, clear, or plain,
(M, K,) not exceeding the due bounds or limits.

الأَمَامُ The location that is before; (M, Msb, *
K;) contr. of الوَرَآءُ. (M, K.) It is used [absolutely] as a noun, and adverbially, (M, Msb, * K,)
necessarily prefixed to another noun: (Mgh:)
and is fem., (Ks, M,) and sometimes mase.: (M,
K:) or it is mase., and sometimes fem. as meaning
the جِهَة: or, as Zj says, they differ as to making
it masc. and making it fem. (Msb.) You say,
كُنْتُ أَمَامَهُ I was before him, in respect of place.
(S.) In the saying of Mohammad, to Usámeh,
الصلَاةُ أَمَامَكَ, the meaning is The time of prayer
[is before thee], or the place thereof; and by the
prayer is meant the prayer of sunset. (Mgh.)
You also say, أَمَامَكَ [i. c. Look before thee;
meaning beware thou; or take thou note;] when
you caution another, (M, K,) or notify him, of a
thing. (M.)
إِمَامٌ A person, (S, Mgh,) or learned man,
(Msb,) whose example is followed, or who is
imitated; (S, Mgh, Msb;) any exemplar, or
object of imitation, (T, M, K,) to a people, or
company of men, (T,) such as a head, chief, or
leader, or some other person, (M, K,) whether
they be following the right way or be erring
therefrom: (T:) applied alike to a male and to a
female: (Mgh, Msb:) applied to a female, it
occurs in a phrase in which it is written by some
with ة: (Mgh:) but this is said to be a mistake:
(Msb:) it is correctly without ة, because it is a
subst., not an epithet: (Mgh, Msb:) or it is
allowable with ة, because it implies the meaning
of an epithet: (Msb:) and ↓ أُمَّةٌ signifies the
same: (T, M, K:) the pl. of the former is أَيِمَّةْ,
(T, S, M, K, [but omitted in the CK,]) originally
أَأْمِمَةٌ, (T, S,) of the measure أَفعِلَةٌ, like أَمْثِلَةٌ,
pl. of مِثَالٌ, (T,) but as two meems come together,
the former is incorporated into the latter, and its
vowel is transferred to the hemzeh before it, which
hemzeh, being thus pronounced with kesr, is
changed into ى; (T, S; *) or it is thus changed
because difficult to pronounce; (M;) or, as Akh
says, because it is with kesr and is preceded by
another hemzeh with fet-h: (S:) but some pronounce it أَئِمَّةٌ, (Akh, T, S, M, K,) namely, those
who hold that two hemzehs may occur together;
(Akh, S;) the Koofees reading it thus in the
Kur ix. 12; (M;) but this is anomalous: (M,
K:) it is mentioned as on the authority of Aboo-Is-hák, and [Az says,] I do not say that it is not
allowable, but the former is the preferable: (T:)
or the pl. is أَئِمَّةٌ, originally أَأْمِمَةٌ like أَمْثِلَةٌ: one
of the two meems being incorporated into the
other after the transfer of its vowel to the hemzeh
[next before it]; some of the readers of the Kur
pronouncing the [said] hemzeh with its true
sound; some softening it, agreeably with analogy,
in the manner termed بَيْنَ بَيْنَ; and some of the
grammarians changing it into ى; but some of
them reckon this incorrect, saying that there is no
analogical reason for it: (Msb:) and accord. to
some, (M,) its pl. is also إِمَامُ, (M, K,) like the
sing., (K,) occurring in the Kur xxv. 74; (M;)
not of the same category as عَدْلٌ (M, K) and رِضَّى,
(M,) because they sometimes said إِمَامَانِ, but a
broken pl.: (M, K: *) or, accord. to A 'Obeyd,
it is in this instance a sing. denoting a pl.: (M,
S: *) or it is pl. of آمٌّ, [which is originally آمِمْ,]
like as صِحَابٌ is pl. of صَاحِبٌ: (M:) the dim.
of أَيِمَّةٌ is ↓ أُوَيْمَّةْ; or, as El-Mázinee says, ↓ أُيَيْمَّةٌ.
(S.) ―
-b2-  الإمَامُ also signifies The Prophet: (K:)
he is called إِمَامُ [the exemplar, object of
imitation, leader, or head, of his nation, or people];
(T;) or إِمَامُ الأمَّةِ [the exemplar, &c., of the nation, or people]; (M;) it being incumbent on all
to imitate his rule of life or conduct. (T.) ―
-b3-
The Khaleefeh: (Msb, K:) he is called إمَامُ الرَّعِيَّةِ
[the exemplar, &c., of the people, or subjects].
(M.) The title of الإمَامُ is still applied to the
Kings of El-Yemen: Aboo-Bekr says, you say,
فُلَانٌ إِمَامُ القَوْمِ, meaning such a one is the first
in authority over the people, or company of men:
and إِمَامُ المَسْلِمِينَ means the head, chief, or
leader, of the Muslims. (TA.) ―
-b4-  The person
whose example is followed, or who is imitated,
[i. e. the leader,] in prayer. (Msb.) ―
-b5-  [The
leading authority, or head, of a persuasion, or
sect. The four أيِمَّة or أَئِمَّة are the heads of the
four principal persuasions, or sects, of the Sunnees; namely, the Hanafees, Sháfi'ees, Málikees,
and Hambelees. And the Hanafees call the two
chief doctors of their persuasion, after Aboo-
Haneefeh, namely, Aboo-Yoosuf and Mohammad,
الإِمَامَانِ The two Imáms.] ―

army. (M, K.) ―
-b7-  The guide: (K:) he is called

called إِمَامُ الإِبِلِ, though he be behind them,
because he guides them. (M.) ―
-b9-  The manager,
or conductor, and right disposer, orderer, or
rectifier, of anything. (M, K. *) ―
-b10-  The Kur-án
(M, K) is called إِمَامُ المُسْلِمينَ [the guide of the
Muslims]; (M;) because it is an exemplar.
(TA.) [The model-copy, or standard-copy, of the
Kur-án, namely the copy of the Khaleefeh 'Othmán, is particularly called الإِمَامُ.] ―
-b11-  [The scripture of any people: and, without the article, a
book, or written record.] It is said in the Kur
[xvii. 73], يَوْمَ نَدْعُو كُلَّ أُنَاسٍ بِإمَامِهِمْ The day
when we shall call every one of mankind with
their scripture: or, as some say, with their
prophet and their law: or, as some say, with
their book in which their deeds are recorded. (T.)
It is also said in the Kur [xxxvi. 11], كُلَّ شَيْءٍ
أَحْصَيْنَاهُ فِى إِمَامٍ مُبِينٍ, meaning, says El-Hasan,
[And everything have we recorded] in a perspicuous book, or writing; (S, Jel;) i. e., on the
Preserved Tablet. (Bd, Jel.) ―

-b16-
إِمَامٌ signifies also A road, or way: (S, [but

road, or way. (TA.) It is said in the Kur
[xv. 79], وَ إِنَّهُمَا لَبِإمَامٍ مُبِينٍ (S, M) And they

(M:) or in a way which they travelled in their

K;) i. e. one who raves, or is delirious, (يَهْذِى,

termed أُمُّ رَأْسِهِ [see أُمٌّ]: (S:) or wounded in
what is so termed; (M, K;) having a wound
such as is termed آمَّة, q. v. (Msb.) It is also
used, metaphorically, in relation to other parts
than that named above; as in the saying,

(tropical:) [And my bowels are wounded by reason of the
burning pain of separation]. (M.)
-A3-  A stone
with which the head is broken: (S, O:) but in
the M and K ↓ أمَيْمَةٌ, [in a copy of the M, however, I find it without any syll. signs, so that
it would seem to be ↓ أَمِيمَةٌ,] explained as signifying stones with which heads are broken: (TA:)
pl. أَمَائِمُ. (S, TA.)
أُمَائِمُ Three hundred camels: (M, K:) so explained by Abu-l-'Alà. (M.)

الإِمِامِيَّةُ One of the exorbitant sects of the
Shee'ah, (TA,) who asserted that 'Alee was expressly appointed by Mohammad to be his successor. (Esh-Shahrastánee p. 122, and KT.)
أُمَيْمِهةٌ [dim. of أُمَّهةٌ] : see أُمٌّ, first sentence.
أُمِّىٌّ (T, M, Mgh, Msb, K) and ↓ أُمَّانٌ (K) [the
former a rel. n. from أُمَّةٌ, and thus properly
meaning Gentile: whence, in a secondary, or
tropical, sense,(assumed tropical:) a heathen;] (assumed tropical:) one not having
a revealed scripture; (Bd in iii. 19 and 69;) so
applied by those having a revealed scripture:
(Bd in iii.69:) [and particularly] an Arab:
(Jel in iii. 69, and Bd and Jel in lxii. 2:) [or]
in the proper language [of the Arabs], of, or
belonging to, or relating to, the nation (أُمَّة) of
the Arabs, who did not write nor read: and
therefore metaphorically applied to (tropical:) any one not
knowing the art of writing nor that of reading:
(Mgh:) or (assumed tropical:) one who does not write; (T, M, K;)
because the art of writing is acquired; as though
he were thus called in relation to the condition
in which his mother (أُمَّهُ) brought him forth:
(T:) or (assumed tropical:) one who is in the natural condition of
the nation (الأُمَّة) to which he belongs, (Zj, * T, M, *
K, *) in respect of not writing, (T,) or not
having learned writing; thus remaining in his
natural state: (M, K:) or (assumed tropical:) one who does not
write well; said to be a rel. n. from أمٌّ; because
the art of writing is acquired, and such a person
is as his mother brought him forth, in respect of
ignorance of that art; or, as some say, from أُمَّةُ
العَرَبِ; because most of the Arabs were of this
description: (Msb:) the art of writing was known
among the Arabs [in the time of Mohammad] by
the people of Et-Táïf, who learned it from a man
of the people of El-Heereh, and these had it from
the people of El-Ambár. (T.) أُمِّيُّون لَا يَعْلَمُونَ,
الكِتَابَ, in the Kur ii. 73, means Vulgar persons,
[or heathen,] who know not the Book of the Law
revealed to Moses: (Jel:) or ignorant persons,
who know not writing, so that they may read that
book; or, who know not the Book of the Law
revealed to Moses. (Bd.) Mohammad was termed
أُمِّىّ [meaning A Gentile, as distinguished from
an Israelite: or, accord. to most of his followers,
meaning illiterate;] because the nation (أُمَّة) of
the Arabs did not write, nor read writing; and
[they say that] God sent him as an apostle when
he did not write, nor read from a book; and this
natural condition of his was one of his miraculous
signs, to which reference is made in the Kur
[xxix. 47], where it is said, “thou didst not read,
before it, from a book, nor didst thou write it
with thy right hand:” (T, TA:) but accord. to the
more correct opinion, he was not well acquainted
with written characters nor with poetry, but
he discriminated between good and bad poetry:
or, as some assert, he became acquainted with
writing after he had been unacquainted therewith, on account of the expression “ before it ”
in the verse of the Kur mentioned above: or, as
some say, this may mean that he wrote though
ignorant of the art of writing, like as some
of the kings, being أُمِّيُّون, write their signs, or
marks: (TA:) or, accord. to Jaafar Es-Sádik,
he used to read from the book, or scripture, if
he did not write. (Kull p. 73.) [Some judicious
observations on this word are comprised in Dr.
Sprenger's Life of Mohammad (pp. 101-2);
a work which, in the portion already published
(Part I.), contains much very valuable information.] ―
-b2-  Also, (K,) or [only] أُمِّىٌّ, (AZ, T, M,)
applied to a man, (AZ, T,) Impotent in speech,
(عَيِىّ, in the K incorrectly written غَبِىّ, TA,)
of few words, and rude, churlish, uncivil, or
surly. (AZ, T, M, K.)
أُمِّيَّةٌ The quality denoted by the epithet أُمِّىٌّ:
(TA:) [gentilism: (assumed tropical:) heathenism: &c.:] (assumed tropical:) the
quality of being [in the natural condition of
the nation to which one belongs, or] as brought
forth by one's mother, in respect of not having
learned the art of writing nor the reading thereof.
(Kull p. 73.)
أُمَّانٌ: see أُمِّىٌّ; and see also art. امن
أُمَّهَدٌ: see أُمٌّ.
آمٌّ [act. part. n. of 1;] i. q. قَاصِدٌ: [see 1, first
sentence:] (TA:) pl. إِمَامٌ, like as صِحَابٌّ is
pl. of صَاحِبٌ, (M, K,) accord. to some, but others
say that this is pl. of إِمَامٌ [q. v.; the sing. and
pl. being alike]; (M;) and آمُّونَ. (TA.) Hence,
in the Kur [v. 2], وَلَا آمِّينَ الْبَيْتَ الْحَرَامَ [Nor
those repairing to the Sacred House]. (TA.)
آمَّةٌ (S, Msb) and ↓ مَأْمُومَةٌ, as some of the
Arabs say, (IB, Msb,) because it implies the
meaning of a pass. part. n., originally; (Msb;)
but 'Alee Ibn-Hamzeh says that this is a mistake;
for the latter word is an epithet applied to the
part called أُمُّ الدِّمَاغِ when it is broken; (IB;)
or شَجَّةٌ آمَّةٌ and ↓ مَأْمُومَةٌ; (M, Mgh, K;) A
wound by which the head is broken, (S, M, Msb,
K,) reaching to the part called أُمُّ الدِّمَاغِ, (S,
Msb,) or, [which means the same,] أُمُّ الرَّأْسِ,
(M, K,) so that there remains between it and
the brain [only] a thin skin: (S:) it is the most
severe of شِجَاج [except that which reaches the
brain (see شَجَّةٌ)]: ISk says that the person
suffering from it roars, or bellows, (يَصْعَقُ,) like
thunder, and like the braying of camels, and
is unable to go forth into the sun: (Msb:) the
mulct for it is one third of the whole price of
blood: (TA:) IAar assigns the meaning of [this
kind of] شَجَّة to ↓ أَمَّةٌ; which seems, therefore,
to be either a dial. var. or a contraction of آمَّةٌ:
