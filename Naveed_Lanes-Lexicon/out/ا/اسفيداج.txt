اسفيداجإِسْفِيدَاجٌ [Ceruse; or white lead;] ashes of lead
(رَمَادُ الرَّصَاصِ والآنُكِ, K, which last word is as
though it were added to explain that immediately
preceding, TA): when subjected to a fierce heat,
it becomes what is termed إِسْرَنْجٌ: [so in the CK:
more probably إِسْرِنْجٌ:] it has clearing and mitigating properties, (K,) and other useful qualities:
(TA:) an arabicized word [from the Persian
اسفيداج isfédáj]. (K.)
