infrà]. (Msb, K.)
أُشْنَةٌ [applied in the present day to Moss: and
particularly, tree-moss: in Persian أُشْنَهْ: but]
Lth says, (TA,) it is a thing that winds itself
upon the trees called بَلُّوط and صَنَوْبَر [oak and
pine] as though it were pared off from a root
(كَأَنَّهُ مَقْشُورٌ مِنْ عِرْقِ); and it is sweet in odour,
and white: (K, TA:) Az says, I do not think it
to be [genuine] Arabic. (TA.)
أُشْنَانٌ and إِشْنَانٌ, (Msb, K,) but the former is
of higher authority than the latter, (TA,) i. q.
حُرْضٌ [Kali, or glasswort]: (Msb in the present
art.; and S, A, Mgh, Msb, K, in art. حرض:)
[and also potash, which is thence prepared;] a
thing, or substance, well known, (K, TA,) with
which clothes and the hands are washed; (TA;
[see قِلْىٌ;]) good, or profitable, [as a remedy] for
the mange, or scab, and the itch; clearing to the
complexion, cleansing, emmenagogue, and abortive.
(K.)

meaning potash]; syn. مِحْرَضَةٌ. (A in art. حرض)
أُشْنَانِىٌّ A seller of أُشْنَان. (TA.)
