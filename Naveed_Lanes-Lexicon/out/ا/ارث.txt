اَرُثَ,
(T, K,) inf. n. أَرْثٌ; (K; in a copy of the A
إِرْثٌ;) but this [says SM] no leading lexicographer has mentioned, nor have I found any
example of it. (TA.) [See also وَرَّثَ.] ―

تأريث also signifies (tropical:)  The exciting discord, dissension, disorder, strife, quarrelling, or animosity,
between a people. (S, K.) You say, أرَث بَيْنَ
القَوْمِ, (M, A,) and أرّث بَيْنَهُمُ الشَّرَّ وَالحَرْبَ, (T,

تَأَرَّثَتِ النَّارُ The fire became kindled, or
lighted; or it burned, burned up, burned brightly
or fiercely, blazed, or flamed. (S, M, K.)
إِرْثٌ, originally وِرْثٌ, (T, S,) Inheritance; or a
person's obtaining possession of property left to
him by one who has died. (MF.) ―
-b2-  An inheritance, or a heritage; what is inherited. (S, A,
K.) ―
-b3-  An old condition, case, or state of things,
which the last has inherited from the first. (S, A,
K.) So in the phrase, هُوَ عَلَى إِرْثٍ مِنْ كَذَا [He
is conforming, in respect of such a thing, with an
old state of things, or an old usage, which he has
inherited from his ancestors]. (S.) And in the
following ex., from a trad., إِنَّكُمْ عَلَى إِرْثٍ مِنْ
إِرْثِ أَبِيكُمْ إِبْرَاهِيمَ [Verily ye are conforming with
an old state of things, or an old usage, which ye
have inherited from your father Abraham], the
meaning is, that his religion was their heritage.
(T, * TA.) [See also وِرْثٌ.] ―
-b4-  A remainder, or
what remains, (M, L, K,) of a thing, (K,) or of
the original of a thing: (M, L:) pl. إِرَاثٌ. (L.)

-b5-  And [hence, app.,] Ashes. (M, K.) ―
-b6-  Also
Origin, race, or stock. (S, M, A, K.) You say,
هُوَ فِى إِرْثِ صِدْقٍ He is of an excellent origin,
race, or stock. (S.) And إِنَّهُ لَفِى إِرْثِ مَجْدٍ
[Verily he is of a glorious origin, race, or stock];
as also إِرْفِ مَجْدٍ, by a change of letters. (Yaa-
koob, M.) Accord. to IAar, إِرْثٌ relates to حَسَب
[or grounds of pretension to respect or honour, on
account of one's ancestors' or one's own deeds or
qualities, &c.]; and وِرْثٌ, to property, or wealth.
(M.) [See art. ورث.]

but in the K “and”) tinder, and the like, prepared for fire; (M, L, K;) [as also ↓ إِرَاثَةٌ and

follows:] or a lump of the dung of a horse or the like,
or a similar thing, with which one kindles a fire; as
also ↓ أُرْثَةٌ: (A:) or this last signifies dung of
camels or horses or the like, (S, K,) or wood, or a

the collection of Meyd, العَدَاوَةِ ↓ النَّمِيمَةُ
[Calumny, or slander, is a means of kindling, or
inflaming, enmity]. (TA: but in Freytag's
Arab. Prov., ii. 773, in the place of اراثة, we find
↓ أُرْثَة.)
