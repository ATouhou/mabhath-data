اى2
أَيَّا آيَةً, [inf. n., by rule, as below,] He put,
or set, a sign, token, or mark, by which a person
or thing might be known. (M.)
-A2-  أَيَّا بِلإِبِلِ,
(inf. n. تَأْييَةٌ, Lth, T,) He chid the camels, saying
to them أَيَايَا, (Lth, T, M, and K in art. أَيَا,) or
أَيَايَهْ, (M,) or يَايَا, (K,) or يَايَهْ. (M, K.)
5
تأيّا, as a trans. verb: see 6.
-A2-  He paused,
stopped, stayed, remained, or tarried, (T, S,
M, K, *) بِا لمَكَانِ in the place; (M, K; * [in the
latter explained by تَلَبَّثَ عَلَيْهِ; but this seems to
be a mistake, arising from the omission of part
of a passage in the M, (one of the chief sources of
the K,) running thus; تَأَيَّا بِا لمَكَانِ تَلَبَّثَ وَتَمَكَّثَ
وَتَأَيَّا عَلَيْهِ انْصَرَفَ فِى تُؤَدَةٍ;]) and confined, restricted, limited, restrained, or withheld, himself.
(T.) In the sense of its inf. n., [by rule تَأَىّ,
originally تَأَيُّىٌ,] they said ↓ تَأَيَّةٌ, or تَإِيَّةٌ or تَئِيَّةٌ;
[thus differently written in different places in
copies of the T and S;] as in the ex. لَيْسَ مَنْزِلُكُمْ
بِدَارِ تَأَيَّةٍ or تَإِيَّةٍ, (IAar, T,) or لَيْسَ مَنْزِلُكُمْ هٰذَا
بِمَنْزِلِ تَأَيَّةٍ or تَإِيَّةٍ, (S,) i. e. Your abode, or this
your abode, is not an abode of tarriance and
confinement. (IAar, T, S.) ―
-b2-  He expected, or
waited for, a thing: (Lth, T:) and he acted with
moderation, gently, deliberately, or leisurely;
without haste; or with gravity, staidness, sedateness, or calmness; (Lth, T, K;) فِى الأَمْرِ in the
affair; inf. n. تَأىٍ. (Lth, T.) تَأَيَّيْتُ عَلَيْهِ, in
a verse of Lebeed, means I acted with moderation, &c., as above, and paused, stopped, stayed,
remained, or tarried, upon him, i. e., upon my
horse: (T:) or I remained firm upon him:
(TA, as on the authority of Az:) but it is explained by Lth as meaning I turned away, or
back, deliberately, or leisurely, upon him. (T:
and the like is said in the M.)
6
تَآيَيْتُهُ, (T, S, M, * K,) and ↓ تَأَيَّيْتُهُ, (S, K,)
I directed my course, or aim, to, or towards,
(T, S, M, * K,) his آيَة, (S, M,) i. e., (M,) his
شَخْص [or body, or corporeal form or figure or
substance, seen from a distance; or person]. (T,
M, K.) The following is an ex., as some relate
it, of the former verb; and as others relate it, of
the latter:
اَلْحُصْنُ أَوْلَى لَوْ تَآيُيْتِهِ
مِنْ حَثْيِكِ التُّرْبَ عَلَى الرَّاكِبِ
[Modest behaviour were more proper, if thou
directedst thy course towards his person, than
thy throwing dust upon the rider]: (S, TA: [in
two copies of the former of which, for أَوْلَى, I
find أَدْنَى:]) said by a woman to her daughter,
on the latter's relating, in a couplet, that a rider,
passing along, had seen her, and she had thrown
dust in his face, purposely. (IB.)
أَىْ a vocative particle, (S, M, Mughnee, K,)
addressed to the near, (S, K,) not to the distant:
(S:) or to the near, or the distant, or the intermediate; accord. to different authorities. (Mughnee.) You say, أَىْ زَيْدُ أَقْبِلْ [O Zeyd, advance:
or, if it may be used in addressing one who is
distant, ho there, soho, or holla: and if used in
addressing one who is between near and distant,
ho, or what ho]: (S:) and أَىْ رَبِّ [O my Lord];
occurring in a trad.: and sometimes it is pronounced ↓ آىْ. (Mughnee.)
-A2-  Also an explicative
particle. (S, M, Mughnee, K.) You say, أَىْ كَذَا
in the sense of يُرِيدُ كَذَا [He means such a thing,
or يَعْنِى كَذَا, which has the same signification;
or أُرِيدُ, or أَعْنِى, I mean; or the like; for all of
which, we may say, meaning; or that is]; (S;)
as in عِنْدِى عَسْجِدٌ أَىْ ذَهَبٌ [I have عَسْجَد, that
is, (I have) ذَهَبَ, or gold]. (Mughnee.) What
follows it is an adjunct explicative of what precedes it, or a substitute. (Mughnee.) AA says
that he asked Mbr respecting what follows it, and
he answered that it may be a substitute for what
precedes, and may be a word independent of
what precedes it, and may be a noun in the accus.
case: and that he asked Th, and he answered
that it may be an explicative, or a word independent of what precedes it, or a noun governed
in the accus. case by a verb suppressed: you say,
جَآءَنِى أَخُوكَ أَىْ زَيْدٌ [Thy brother came to me;
that is, Zeyd]; and you may say, أَىْ زَيْدًا [I
mean Zeyd]: and رَأَيْتُ أَخَاكَ أَىْ زَيْدًا [I saw thy
brother; I mean, or that is, Zeyd]; and you
may say, أَىْ زَيْدٌ [that is, Zeyd]: and مَرَرْتُ
بِأَخِيكَ أَىْ زَيْدٍ [I passed by thy brother; that is,
by Zeyd]; and you may say, أَىْ زَيدًا [I mean,
Zeyd]; and أَىْ زَيْدٌ [that is, Zeyd]. (T, TA.)
When it occurs after تَقُولُ, in a case like the following, [i. e., when a verb following it explains a
verb preceding it,] one says, تَقُولُ اِسْتَكْتَمْتُهُ الحَدِيثَ
أَىْ سَأَلْتُهُ كِتْمَانَهُ [Thou sayest, استكتمته الحديث,
meaning سألته كتمانه I asked of him the concealment of it, namely, the discourse, or story;
and so when تَقُولُ is understood, as is often, or
generally, the case in lexicons]; with damm to
the ت: but if you put إِذَا in the place of أَىْ, you
say, إِذَا سَأَلْتَهُ, with fet-h, because أَذا is an adverbial
noun relating to تَقُولُ. (Mughnee.)
-A3-  See also
أَىٌّ, near the beginning of the paragraph, in three
places.
إِىْ is a particle denoting a reply, meaning نَعَمْ
[Yes, or yea]; importing acknowledgment of the
truth of an enunciation; and the making a thing
known, to him who asks information; and a promise, to him who seeks or demands; therefore it
occurs after such sayings as “Zeyd stood” and
“Did Zeyd stand.?” and “Beat thou Zeyd,” and
the like; as does نَعَمْ: Ibn-El-Hájib asserts that
it occurs only after an interrogation; as in the
saying [in the Kur x. 54], وَيَسْتَنْبِؤُنَكَ أَحَقٌّ هُوَ قُلٌ
إِ ىْ وَرَبِىّ [And they will ask thee to inform them,
saying, Is it true? Say, Yea, by my Lord!]:
but accord. to all, it does not occur otherwise than
before an oath: and when one says, إِ ىْ وَاللّٰهِ
[Yea, by God!], and then drops the و the ى
may be quiescent, and with fet-h, and elided; [so
that you say, إِ ىْ اللّٰهِ, and إِ ىَ اللّٰهِ, and إِ اللّٰهِ;] in
the first of which cases, two quiescent letters
occur together, irregularly. (Mughnee.) Lth says,
إِ ىْ is an oath, as in إ ِىْ وَرَبِّى meaning, says
Zj, نَعَمْ وَرَبِّى: IAar is also related to have said
the like; and this is the correct explanation. (T.)
[J says,] It is a word preceding an oath, meaning
بَلَى [q. v.]; as in إِ ىْ وَرَبِّى and إِ ىْ وَاللّٰه. (S.)
[ISd and F say,] It is syn. with نَعَمْ, and is conjoined with an oath: and one says also هِىْ.
(M, K.)
أَىٌّ is a noun, used in five different manners.
(Mughnee.) One of its meanings is that of an
interrogative, (T, S, M, Mughnee, K,) relating to
intellectual beings and to non-intellectual things;
[meaning Who? which? and what?] (S, M, K;)
and as such, it is a decl. noun: (S:) it is said in
the K to be a particle; (MF;) and so in the M;
(TA;) but this is wrong: (MF:) and it is added
in the K that it is indecl.; (MF;) and it is said
to be so in the M, accord. to Sb, in an instance
to be explained below; (TA;) but this is only
when it is a conjunct noun [like الَّذِى], or denotes
the object of a vocative: (MF:) or, accord. to
some, it is decl. as a conjunct noun also. (Mughnee.) You say, أَيُّهُمْ أَخُوكَ [Who, or which, of
them, is thy brother?]. (S.) Another ex. is the
saying [in the Kur vii. 184, and last verse of
lxxvii.], فَبِأَىِّ حَدِيثٍ بَعْدَهُ يُؤْمِنُونَ [And in what
announcement, after it, will they believe?]. (Mughnee.) Sometimes it is without teshdeed; as in the
saying (of El-Farezdak, M),
↓ تَنَظَّرْتُ نَصْرًا وَالسِّمَاكَيْنِ أَيْهُمَا
عَلَىَّ مِنَ الغَيْثِ اسْتَهَلَّتْ مَوَاطِرُهْ
[I looked for rain, or aid from the clouds, and
the two Simáks (stars so called). Of which of
them two did the rains pour vehemently upon me
from the clouds?]: (M, Mughnee, K: * [in the
last of which, only the former hemistich is given,
with نَسْرًا (meaning the star or asterism so called)
instead of نَصْرًا:]) so by poetic licence: (M:)
IJ says that for this reason the poet has elided
the second ى, but should have restored the first
ى to و, because it is originally و. (TA. [But
this assertion, respecting the first ى, I regard as
improbable.]) ↓ أَيْمَ, also, is a contraction of
أَىُّ مَا, meaning أَىُّ شَىْءٍ: so in the saying, أَيْمَ
هُوَ يَا فُلَانُ [What thing is it, O such a one?]:
and أَيْمَ تَقُولُ [What thing sayest thou?]. (TA
in art. ايم.) In like manner, also, ↓ أَيْشَ is used
as a contraction of أَىُّ شَىْءٍ. (Ks, TA in art.
جرم.) A poet speaks of his companions as being
بِأَىَ وَأَيْنَمَا; making أَىّ the name of the quarter
(جِهَة); so that, being determinate and of the
feminine gender, it is imperfectly declinable. (M.
[See أَينٌ; under which head two other readings
are given; and where it is said that the verse in
which this occurs is by Homeyd Ibn-Thowr.])
أَىّ is never without a noun or pronoun to which
it is prefixed, except in a vocative expression and
when it is made to conform with a word to which
it refers, as in cases to be exemplified hereafter.
(Mughnee.) Being so prefixed, it is determinate;
but sometimes, [as in the latter of the cases just
mentioned,] it is not so prefixed, yet has the
meaning of a prefixed noun. (S.) When used as
an interrogative, it is not governed, as to the
letter, though it is as to the meaning, by the verb
that precedes it, but by what follows it; as in the
saying in the Kur [xviii. 11], لِنَعْلَمَ أَىُّ الحِزْبَيْنِ
أَحْصَى [That we might know which of the two
parties was able to compute]; and in the same
[xxvi. last verse], وَسَيَعْلَمُ الَّذَينَ ظَلَمُوا أَىَ مُنْقَلَبٍ
يَنْقَلِبُونَ [And they who have acted wrongly shall
know with what a translating they shall be translated]: (Fr, * Th, Mbr, T, S: *) when it is governed by the verb before it, it has not the interrogative meaning, as will be shown hereafter.
(Fr, T.) In the saying of the poet,
تَصِيحُ بِنَا حَنِيفَةُ إذْ رَأَتْنَا
وَأَىَّ الأَرْضِ تَذْهَبُ لِلصِّيَاحِ
[Haneefeh (the tribe so named) shout to us when
they see us. And to what place of the earth, or
land, will they go for the shouting?], أَىّ is in the
accus. case because the prep. إِلَى is suppressed
before it. (S.) When they separate it [from what
follows it, not prefixing it to another noun], the
Arabs say أَىٌ, and in the dual أَيَّانِ, and in the
pl. أَيُّونَ; and they make it fem., saying أَيَّةٌ, and
[in the dual] أَيَّتَانِ, and [in the pl.] أَيَّاتٌ: but
when they prefix it to a noun, properly so called,
not a pronoun, they make it sing. and masc.,
saying أَىُ الرَّجُلَيْنِ [Who, or which, of the two
men?], and أَىُ المَرْأَتَيْنِ [Who, or which, of the
two women?], and أَىُّ الّرِجَالِ [Who, or which, of
the men?], and أَىُّ النِّسَآءِ [Who, or which, of the
women?]: and when they prefix it to a fem.
pronoun, they make it masc. [as when they prefix
it to a masc. pronoun] and fem., saying أَيُّهُمَا and
أَيَّتُهُمَا [Who, or which, of them two?], meaning
women; (Fr, T;) [the latter of which seems to
be the more common; for ISd says,] sometimes
they said أَيُّهُنَّ [Who, or which, of them? referring
to women], meaning أَيَّتُهُنَّ. (M.) It is said in
the Kur [xxxi. last verse], وَمَا تَدْرِى نَفْسٌ بِأَىِّ أَرضٍ
تَمُوتُ [And a person knoweth not in what land
he will die]: (S:) but some read بِأَيَّةِ أَرْضٍ; and
Sb compares this fem. form to كُلَّتُهُنَّ. (Bd.)
When it is used as an interrogative relating to an
indeterminate noun in a preceding phrase, أَىّ is
made to conform with that indeterminate noun in
case-ending and in gender and in number; and
this is done [alike, accord. to some,] in the case
of its connexion with a following word and in the
case of a pause; so that, [in the case of a pause,]
to him who says, جَآءَنِى رَجُلٌ [A man came to
me], you say, [accord. to the authorities alluded to
above,] أَىٌّ [Who?]; and to him who says, رَأَيْتُ
رَجُلًا [I saw a man], أَيَّا [Whom?]; and to him
who says, مَرَرْتُ بِرَجلٍ [I passed by a man], أَىٍّ
[Whom?]: and in like manner, [accord. to all
authorities,] in the case of its connexion with a
following word; as أَىُّ يَا فَتَى [Who, O young
man?], and أَيَّا يَا فَتَى [Whom, O young man?],
and أَىٍ يَا فَتَى [Whom, O young man?]: and in
the case of the fem. you say, أَيَّةٌ and أَيَّةً and أَيَّةٍ
[in the nom. and accus. and gen. respectively];
and in the dual, أَيَّانِ and أَيَّتَانِ in the nom. case
[masc. and fem. respectively], and أَيَّيْنِ and أَيَّتَيْنِ
in the accus. and gen. cases [masc. and fem.
respectively]; and in the pl., [with the like distinction of genders,] أَيُّونَ and أَيَّاتٌ in the nom.
case, and أَيِّينَ and أَيَّاتٍ in the accus. and gen.
cases. (I' Ak p. 319.) [Exs. in cases of pause,
agreeing with the foregoing rules, are given in
the T; and exs. in cases of connexion with following words, agreeing with the foregoing, are
given in the Mughnee: but J gives rules differing
from the foregoing in some respects; and IB
gives rules differing in some points both from
the foregoing and from those of J.] It is said in
the S, أَىّ is made to conform with indeterminate
nouns significant of intellectual beings and of nonintellectual things, and is used as an interrogative;
and when it is thus used in reference to an indeterminate noun, you make it to have a caseending like that of the noun respecting which
it demands positive information; so that when
it is said to you, مَرَّبِى رَجُلٌ [A man passed by
me], you say, أَىٌّ يَا فَتَى [Who, O young man?],
thus giving it a case-ending [like that of رَجُلٌ]
when it is in connexion with a following word;
and you indicate the case-ending [by the pronunciation termed الرَّوْمُ, saying أَىُّ, with a somewhat obscure utterance of the final vowel,] in
pausing; and if one says, رَأَيْتُ رَجُلًا [I saw a
man], you say, أَيَّا يَافَتَى [Whom, O young
man?], giving it a case-ending [like that of رَجُلًا],
with tenween, when it is [thus] in connexion with
a following word; and you pause upon the ا,
saying أَيَّا; and when one says, مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ [I
passed by a man], you say, أَىٍّ يَافَتَى [Whom,
O young man? in a case of connexion with a
following word; and أَىِّ in a case of pausing]:
you conform with what the other has said, in
the nom. and accus. and gen. cases, in the case
of connexion with a following word and in that
of pausing: but IB says that this is correct only
in the case of connexion with a following word;
for in the case of a pause, you say only أَىّْ, in
the nom. and gen., with sukoon; and you imitate
in both of these cases only when you use the
dual form or the pl.: it is added in the S, you
say in the cases of the dual and pl. and fem.
like as we have said respecting مَنْ: when one
says, جَآءَنِى رِجَالٌ [Men came to me], you say,
أَيُّونْ [Who?], with the ن quiescent; and أَيِينْ
in the accus. and gen.: but IB says, the correct
mode is to say, أَيُّونَ and أَيِّنَ, with fet-h to the
ن in both; [meaning that this is the only allowable mode in the case of connexion with a following word, and app. that it is the preferable
mode in the case of a pause;] the quiescent ن
being allowable only in the case of a pause, and
with respect to مَنْ, for you say مَنُونْ and مَنِينْ
with the quiescent ن only: it is then added in
the S, you say, also, أَيَّهْ [Who? and whom?] in
using the fem. [in a case of pause]; but in a
case of connexion with a following word, [when
referring to a noun in the accus.,] you say, أَيَّةً
يَا هٰذَا [Whom, O thou? in the sing.], and أَيَّاتٍ
[in the pl.; and in like manner, أَيَّةٌ in the nom.
sing., and أَيَّةٍ in the gen. sing.; and أَيَّاتٌ in the
nom. pl., and أَيَّاتٍ in the gen. pl.]: but when the
interrogation refers to a determinate noun, أَىّ is
in the nom. case (with refa) only. (TA.) [See also
أَيَّانَ, below.] ―
-b2-  [In other cases, now to be mentioned, it is used alike as sing., dual, and pl.] ―
-b3-
It also denotes a condition; (T, S, M, Mughnee;)
in which case, also, it is a decl. noun, applied
to an intellectual being and to a non-intellectual
thing. (S.) So in the saying, أَيُّهُمْ يُكْرِمْنِى أُكْرِمْهُ
[Whichever of them treats me with honour, I
will treat him with honour]. (S.) So, too, in
the saying [in the Kur xvii. 110], أَيًّا مَا تَدْعُوا فَلَهُ
الأَسْمَآءُ الحُسْنَى [Whichever ye call Him, He
hath the best names]. (T, * Mughnee.) And in
the saying [in the same, xxviii. 28], أَيَّمَا الْأَجَلَيْنِ
قَضَيْتُ فَلَا عُدْوَانَ عَلَىَّ [Whichever of the two
terms I fulfil, there shall be no wrongdoing to
me]. (Mughnee.) One says also, صَحِبَهُ اللّٰهُ أَيَّا
مَا تَوَجَّهَ, meaning أَيْنَمَاتَوَجَّهَ [May God accompany him wherever he goeth]. (AZ, T.) And
Zuheyr uses the expression أَيَّةً سَلَكُوا for أَيَّةَ وِجْهَةٍ
سَلَكُوا [Whatever tract they travelled, or travel].
(T.) The saying, أَيِّى وَأَيُّكَ كَانَ شَرَّا فَأَخْزَاهُ اللّٰهُ
[Whichever of me and thee be evil, may God
abase him !] was explained by Kh to Sb as meaning أَيُّنَا كَانَ شَرًّا [whichever of us two be evil];
and as being like the saying, أَخْزَى اللّٰهُ الكَاذِبَ
مِنِىّ وَمِنْكَ, meaning مِنَّا. (M. [And in a similar
manner, the former clause of that saying, occurring in a verse, with مَا after أَيِّى, is said in the
T to have been explained by Kh to Sb.]) ―
-b4-  It
is also a conjunct noun; (Mughnee;) [i. e.] it is
sometimes used in the manner of الَّذِى, and therefore requires a complement; as in the saying,
أَيُّهُمْ فِى الدَّارِ أَخُوكَ [He, of them, who is in the
house is thy brother]: (S:) [i. e.] it is syn. with
الَّذِى. (M, Mughnee.) So in the saying [in the
Kur xix. 70], ثُمَّ لَنَنْزِعَنَّ مِنْ كُلِّ شِيعَةٍ أَيُّهُمْ أَشَدُّ
عَلَى الرَّحْمٰنِ عُتِيَّا [Then we will assuredly draw
forth, from every sect, him, of them, who is
most exorbitantly rebellious against the Compassionate]: so says Sb: but the Koofees and a
number of the Basrees disagree with him, holding
that the conjunct noun أَىّ is always decl., like
the conditional and the interrogative: Zj says,
“It has not appeared to me that Sb has erred
except in two instances, whereof this is one;
for he has conceded that it is decl. when separate,
and how can he say that it is indecl. when it is a
prefixed noun?” and El-Jarmee says, “I have
gone forth from El-Basrah, and have not heard,
from my leaving the Khandak to Mekkeh, any
one say, لَأَضْرِبَنَّ أَيُّهُمْ قَائِمٌ [as meaning I will
assuredly beat him, of them, who is standing],
with damm:” these assert, that it is, in the verse
above, an interrogative, and that it is an inchoative, and اشد is an enunciative: but they differ
as to the objective complement of the verb: Kh
says that this is suppressed, and that the implied
meaning is, we will assuredly draw forth those
of whom it will be said, Which of them is most
&c.? and Yoo says that it is the proposition
[ايهّم &c.], and that the verb is suspended from
governing, as in the instance in the Kur xviii. 11,
cited above: and Ks and Akh say that it is
كلّ شيعة, that من is redundant, and that the interrogative proposition is independent of what precedes it; this being grounded on their saying that
the redundance of مِنْ is allowable in an affirmative proposition: but these [following] facts refute
their sayings; viz. that the suspension of government is peculiar to verbs significant of operations
of the mind; and that it is not allowable to say,
لَأَضْرِبَنَّ الفَاسِقُ, with refa, as meaning by implication “I will assuredly beat him of whom it is
said, He is the transgressor;” and that the redundance of مِنْ in an affirmative proposition is
not correct. (Mughnee. [Some further remarks
on the same subject, in that work, mentioning
other opinions as erroneous, I omit. Another
reading of the passage in the Kur cited above
(xix. 70) will be found in what here follows.])
[ISd states that] they said, لَأَضْربَنَّ أَيُّهُمْ أَفْضَلُ
[I will assuredly beat him, of them, who is most
excellent], and أَىٌّ أَفْضَلُ [him who is most excel-lent]; اىّ being indecl., accord. to Sb, and therefore the verb does not govern it [save as to the
meaning]. (M.) And [that] you say, اِضْرِبْ أَيُّهُمْ
أَفْضَلُ [Beat thou him, of them, who is most excellent], and أَيَّهُمْ أَفْضَلُ [meaning the same, or
whichever of them, &c.]; suppressing the relative
هُوَ after ايّهم. (M in a later part of the same
art.) Fr says that when أَىّ is governed by the
verb before it, it has not the interrogative meaning; and you may say, لَأَضْرِبَنَّ أَيَّهُمْ يَقُولُ ذٰلِكَ
[I will assuredly beat him, of them, or whichever of them, says that]: and he says that he who
reads أَيَّهُمْ, in the accus. case, in the passage of
the Kur cited above (xix. 70) makes it to be
governed by لَنَنْرِعَنَّ. (T.) Ks says, you say,
لَأَضْرِبَنَّ أَيَّهُمْ فِى الدَّارِ [I will assuredly beat him,
of them, or whichever of them, is in the house];
but you may not say, ضَرَبْتُ أَيَّهُمْ فِى الدَّارِ: thus
he distinguishes between the actual occurrence
and that which is expected. (S.) Akh says,
also, that it may be indeterminate and qualified
by an epithet; as when one says, مَرَرْتُ بِأَىٍّ
مُعْجِبٍ لَكَ, like as one says, بِمَنْ مُعْجِبٍ لَكَ [I
passed by one pleasing to thee]: but this has not
been heard [from the Arabs]. (Mughnee.) ―
-b5-  It
also denotes perfection, or consummateness: and
in this case it is an epithet applying to an indeterminate noun; as in زَيْدٌ رَجُلٌ أَىُّ رَجُلٍ (tropical:) [Zeyd
is a man; what a man!], meaning that he is
complete, or consummate, in the qualities of men:
and it is a denotative of state relating to a determinate noun; as in مَرَرْتُ بِعَبْدِ اللّٰهِ أَىَّ رَجُلٍ (tropical:) [I
passed by 'Abd-Allah; what a man was he!]:
(Mughnee:) and used in this sense, it is tropical.
(Har p. 534.) [J says,] it is sometimes an epithet
applying to an indeterminate noun: you say,
مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ أَىِّ رَجُلٍ and أَيِّمَارَجُلٍ (assumed tropical:) [I passed by
a man; what a man!]; and مَرَرْتُ بِامْرَأَةٍ أَيَّةِ امْرَأَةٍ
(assumed tropical:) [I passed by a woman; what a woman!], and
بِامْرَأَتَيْنِ أَيَّتِمَا امْرَأَتَيْنِ [by two women; what two
women!]; and هٰذِهِ امْرَأَةٌ أَيَّةُ امْرَأَةٍ (assumed tropical:) [This is
a woman; what a woman!]: and أَيَّتُمَا امْرَأَ أَيَّةُ امْرَأَةٍ
(assumed tropical:) [What two women!]; ما being redundant: and
in the case of a determinate noun, you say, هٰذَا
زَيْدٌ أَيَّمَا رَجُلٍ (assumed tropical:) [This is Zeyd; what a man is
he!]; putting it in the accus. case as a denotative
of state; and هٰذِهِ أَمَةُ اللّٰهِ أَيَّتَمَا جَارِيّةٍ (assumed tropical:)  [This is
the handmaid of God; what a girl, or young
woman, is she!]: you say, also, [in using an indeterminate noun,] أَىُّ امْرَأَةٍ جَآءَتْكَ and جَآءَكَ,
and أَيَّةُ امْرَأَةٍ جَآءَتْكَ (assumed tropical:)  [What a woman came to
thee!]; and مَرَرْتُ بِجَارِيَةٍ أَىِّ جَارِيَةٍ (assumed tropical:)  [I passed
by a girl, or young woman; what a girl, or
young woman!]; and جِئْتُكَ بِمُلَآءَةٍ أَىِّ مُلَآءَةٍ and
أَيَّةِ مُلَآءِةٍ (assumed tropical:)  [I brought thee a body-wrapper; what
a body-wrapper!]: all are allowable. (S.) [In
all these it evidently denotes admiration, or
wonder, at some good or extraordinary quality
in the person or thing to which it relates; notwithstanding that J says afterwards,] and sometimes it is used to denote wonder; as in the saying
of Jemeel,
بُثَيْنَ الْزَمِى لَا إَنَّ لَا إِنْ لَزِمْتِهِ
عَلَى كَثْرَةِ الوَاشِينَ أَىُّ مَعُونِ
(assumed tropical:)  [O Butheyneh, (بُثَيْنَ being a curtailed form
of بُثَيْنَة, a woman's name,) adhere thou to “No:”
verily “No,” if thou adhere to it, notwithstanding the numbers of the slanderers, what a help
will it be!]: (S:) i. e., an excellent help will
be thy saying “No” in repelling, or rebutting,
the slanderers, though they be many. (TA in
art. عون.) Fr gives as exs. of its use to denote
wonder the sayings, أَىُّ رَجُلٍ زَيْدٌ [What a man
is Zeyd!], and أَىُّ جَارِيَهٍ زَيْنَبُ [What a girl, or
young woman, is Zeyneb!]. (T.) It denotes
wonder at the sufficiency, and great degree of
competence, of the person [or thing] to whom [or
to which] it relates. (M.) El-Kattál El-Kilábee
says,
وَلَمَّا رَأَيْتُ أَنَّنِى قَدْ قَتَلْتُهُ
نَدِمْتُ عَلَيْهِ أَىَّ سَاعَةِ مَنْدَمِ
[And when I saw that I had slain him, I repented
of it; in what an hour, or time, of repentance!]:
i. e., when I slew him, I repented of it, in a time
when repentance did not profit: اىّ being here in
the accus. case as an adv. n.; for, as it denotes
the part of a whole, its predicament is made to be
the same as that of the affixed noun, of whatever
kind this may be. (Ham p. 95.) ―
-b6-  It also has
ك prefixed to it; and thus it becomes changed
in signification so as to denote numerousness,
being syn. with the enunciative كَمْ [How many!];
(S, K;) or syn. with رُبَّ [as meaning many]:
(Sb, M:) [and sometimes it is syn. with the
interrogative كَمْ, meaning how many? or how
much? as will be shown below:] thus it is written
كَأَىٍّ, (M,) or كَأَيِّنْ, (S, M, K,) its tenween
being written ن; (S, K;) and كَآءٍ, (M,) or
[more commonly] كَائِنْ, (S, M, K, [in some
copies of the S and K كَايِنْ,]) like كَاعِنْ, (S,)
said by IJ, on the authority of Aboo-'Alee, to be
formed from كَأَيِّنْ, by putting the double ى
before the ء, after the manner of the transposition
in قِسِىٌّ and a number of other words, so that it becomes كَيَّأٍ [or كَيَّئِنْ], then suppressing the second
ى, as is done in مَيِّتٌ and هَيِّنٌ and لَيِّنٌ, so that
it becomes كَىْءٍ [or كَىْءِنْ], and then changing
the [remaining] ى into ا, as in [طَيْئِىٌّ, which
becomes] طَادِىٌّ, and in [حِيرِىٌّ, which becomes]
حَارِىٌّ, so that it becomes كَآءٍ [or كَائِنْ]; (M;)
and it has other dial. vars.; namely كَيْئِنٌ [one
of the intermediate forms between كَأَيِّنْ and
كَائِنْ mentioned above]; (K; [in one copy of
the K written كَيَيِّنْ, and so accord. to the TK;])
and كَأْىٍ, (M, K,) of the measure of رَمْىٍ, and
most probably formed by transposition from كَىْءٍ,
mentioned above; (M;) and كَأ, of the measure
of عَمٍ, (M, TA,) incorrectly written in the copies
of the K كَاءٍ, i. e. like كَاعٍ, (TA,) formed by the
suppression of ى in كَىْءٍ; a change not greater
than that from أَيْمُنُ اللّٰهِ to مُ اللّٰهِ and مِ اللّٰهِ. (M.)
You say, كَأَيِّنْ رَجُلًا لَقِيتُ [How many a man
have I met! or many a man &c.], (S, K, *)
putting the noun following كأيّن in the accus.
case as a specificative; (S;) and كَأَيِّنْ مِنْ رَجُلٍ
لَقِيتُ; (S, K; *) and the introduction of مِنْ after
كَأيّن is more common, and better. (S. [And Sb,
as cited in the M, says the like.]) You say also,
كَأَيِّنْ قَدْ أَتَانِى رَجُلًا [How many a man has come
to me! or many a man &c.]. (Sb, M.) And بِكَأَيِّنْ
تَبِيعُ هٰذَا الثَّوْبَ, i. e. بِكَمْ تبيع [For how much
wilt thou sell this garment, or piece of cloth?].
(S.) Kh says that if any one of the Arabs made
it to govern the gen. case, perhaps he did so by
making مِنْ to be implied, as is allowable with
كَمْ: (M:) [so that you may say, بِكَأَيِّنْ دِرْهَمٍ
اشْتَرَيْتَ هٰذَا For how many a dirhem didst thou
buy this? for] it is allowable to make the noun
that follows كَمْ to be governed in the gen. case
by منْ implied, when كم immediately follows a
preposition; as in بِكضمْ دِرْهَمٍ اشْتَرَيْتَ هٰذَا; but
when it is not thus preceded by a preposition, the
noun after it must be in the accus. case. (I 'Ak
p. 317.) It always holds the first place in a
proposition, like كَمْ. (Idem, next p.) ―
-b7-  It is
also a connective of the vocative يَا with the noun
signifying the person or persons or thing called,
when this noun has the article ال prefixed to it;
(S, M, Mughnee, K;) and with a noun of indication, as ذَا; and with a conjunct noun having ال
prefixed to it, as الذِّى: (I 'Ak p. 268:) it is a
noun formed for serving as such a connective;
(M, K;) and has هَا affixed to it. (S, M, &c.)
You say, يَا أَيُّهَا الرَّجُلُ [which seems to be best
rendered O thou man; more agreeably with the
original, O thou, the man; or, accord. to Akh,
O thou who art the man; lit., O he who is the
man; often written يَأَيُّهَا]; (T, S, M, Mughnee,
K;) and يَاأَيُّهَا الرَّجُلَانِ [O ye two men]; and
يَاأَيُّهَا الرِّجَالُ [O ye men]; (M;) and يَاأَيَّتُهَاالمَرْأَةُ
[O thou woman]; (S, M;) and يَا أَيَّتُهَا المَرْأَتَانِ
[O ye two women]; and أَيَّتُهَا النّسْوَةُ [O ye
women]; and يَاأَيُّهَا المَرْأَةُ, and المَرْأَتَانِ, and
النِّسْوَةُ; (M;) and يَاأَيُّهَا ذَا [O thou, this person
or thing]; and يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِى فَعَلَ كَذَا [O thou
who didst, or hast done, thus]. (I 'Ak p. 267.)
In the first of the exs. here given, أَىّ is a noun
of vague signification, (Zj, T, S,) denoting the
person called, (Zj, T,) of the sing. number, (Zj,
T, S,) rendered determinate by the vocative [يا],
(S,) indecl., with damm for its termination; (Zj,
T, S;) and هَا is a particle employed to rouse
attention, or to give notice, a substitute for the
noun to which أَىّ is in other cases prefixed; and
الرَّجُلُ is a qualificative to أَىّ, (Zj, T, S,) wherefore it is in the nom. case. (S.) Akh asserts, [as
we have indicated above,] that أَىّ is here the
conjunct noun, and that the first member of its
complement, namely the relative هُوَ, is suppressed;
the meaning being, يَا مَنْ هُوَ الرَّجُلُ: but this
assertion is refuted by the fact that there is no
relative pronoun that must be suppressed, nor any
conjunct noun that necessarily requires that its
complement should be a nominal proposition:
though he might reply to these two objections by
arguing that ما in the saying لَا سِيَّمَا زَيْدٌ is in like
manner [virtually] in the nom. case [as a conjunct
noun syn. with الَّذِى, and that the first member
of its complement, namely هُوَ, an inchoative of
which زَيْدٌ is the enunciative, is suppressed].
(Mughnee.) The putting of the qualificative of
أَىّ in the accus. case, as in the saying يَا أَيُّهَا الرَّجُلَ
أَقْبِلْ [O thou man, advance], is allowed (M, K)
by El-Mázinee; but it is not known [as heard
from the Arabs]. (M.) أَيُّهَا and أَيَّتُهَا are also
used for the purpose of particularizing; [in which
case they are not preceded by يا;] as when one
says, أَمَّا أَنَا فَأَفْعَلُ كَذَا أَيُّهَا الرَّجُلُ [As for me, I
will do thus, or such a thing, thou man], meaning
himself; and as in the saying of Kaab Ibn-Málik,
related in a trad., فَتَخَلَّفْنَا أَيَّتُهَا الثَّلَاثَهُ [And we
remained behind, or held back, ye three], meaning,
by the three, those particularized as remaining
behind [with him], or holding back. (TA.)
أَيَا: see art. ايا.
-A2-  أَيًا: see the next paragraph.
إِيَا الشَّمْسِ, [the former word, when alone and
indeterminate, perhaps (as when determinate)
without tenween, for it is-explained (with its dial.
vars.) in the S and K in باب الالف الليّنة, though
it is also explained in some copies of the S in
the present art.,] and الشمس ↓ أَيَاةُ, (T, S, M,
Mgh, K,) and الشمس ↓ أَيَاةُ, (S, M, K,) and ↓ أَيَآءُ
الشمس, (T, M, Mgh, K, and in a copy of the S,)
with fet-h and medd, (T, Mgh, K, and so in a
copy of the S,) The light of the sun, (S, M, Mgh,
K,) and its beauty: (M, K:) or its rays, and its
light: (T:) or, as some say, الشمس ↓ اياة signifies
the halo of the sun; that, with respect to the sun,
which is like the هَالَة with respect to the moon;
i. e. the دَارَة around the sun: (S:) the pl. [of
أَيَاةٌ] is ↓ أَيًا and إِيَآءٌ; [or rather the former is a
coll. gen. n.;] like أَكَمٌ and إِكَامٌ in relation to
أَكَمَةٌ. (M.) Tarafeh says, (T, S, Mgh,) describing the fore teeth (ثَغْر) of his beloved, (EM
p. 62,)
الشَّمْسِ إِلَّا لِثَاتِهِ ↓ سَقَتْهُ إِيَاةُ
[The light of the sun has shed its lustre upon
them, except their gums]. (T, S, Mgh.) ―
-b2-  And
hence, by way of comparison, (M,) إِيَا النَّبَاتِ, and
↓ أَيَاؤُهُ, (M, K,) and ↓ إِيَاتُهُ, and ↓ أَيَاتُهُ, (K,)
(tropical:)  The beauty of herbage, (M, K,) and its blossoms, (M,) and brightness, (K, TA,) in its verdure and growth. (TA.)
-A2-  أَيَا إِيَاهُ أَقْبِلْ: see أَيَا,
in art. ايا.
أَيَآء: see the next preceding paragraph, throughout.
أَيَاةٌ: se the next preceding paragraph, throughout.
إِيَاةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, throughout.
أُيَيَّةٌ dim. of آءٌ: see the letter ا.
إِيَيَّةٌ dim. of آيَةٌ, q. v. (T.)
أَيَّا: see إِيَّا, in art. ايا.
إِيَّا: see art. ايا. [Az says,] I have not heard
any derivation of إِيَّا; but I think, without being
certain, that it is from تَآيَيْتُهُ as explained above;
as though it were a noun from that verb, of the
measure فِعْلَى, like ذِكْرَى from ذَكَرْتُ; so that
the meaning of إِيَّاكَ is I direct myself, or my
aim, to, or towards, thee, and thy person. (T.)
أَيِّىٌّ [a rel. n. of أَىٌّ]. When you ask a man
respecting his كُورَة [i. e. district, or city, or
town], you say, اَلْأَيِّىُّ [The person of what district, &c., art thou?]; like as you say, in asking
him respecting his قَبِيلَة [or tribe], اَلْمَنِىُّ [from
مَنْ]: and you say also, أَيِّىٌّ أَنْتَ [A person of
what district, &c., art thou?]; and مَنىٌّ
(T.) [See also مَنِىٌّ, in art. من.]
أَيَّانَ: see art. اين. Lth says that it is used in
the manner of مَتَى; [signifying When?]; and
that some say its ن is radical; others, that it is
augmentative: (T:) IJ says, it must be from أَىٌّ,
not from أَيْنَ, for two reasons: first, because أَيْنَ
denotes place; and أَيَّانَ, time: and secondly,
because nouns of the measure فَعَّال are few; and
those of the measure فَعْلَان, many: so that if you
name a man أَيَّان, it is imperfectly decl.: and he
adds, that أَىٌّ means a part of a whole; so that
it applies as properly to times as it does to other
things: (TA:) Fr says that it is originally أَىَّ أَوَانٍ
[at what time?]. (T.) One says, of a stupid, or
foolish, person, لَا يَعْرَفُ أَيَّانَ [He knows not
when]. (IB.)
آىْ: see أَىْ:
-A2-  and see also 2 in art. اوى.
-A3-  ىٌ: see what next follows, in two places.
آيَةٌ A sign, token, or mark, by which a person
or thing is known; syn. عَلَامَةٌ (IAar, T, S, M,
Msb, K) and أَمَارَةٌ: (M, K:) it properly signifies
any apparent thing inseparable from a thing not
equally apparent, so that when one perceives the
former, he knows that he perceives the other,
which he cannot perceive by itself, when the two
things are of one predicament; and this is apparent in the object of sense and in that of the
intellect: (Er-Rághib, TA:) it is of the measure
فَعْلَةٌ, (M, K,) originally أَيَّةٌ; the [former] ى being
changed to ا because the letter before it is with
fet-h, though this is an extraordinary change:
(M:) this is related as on the authority of Sb:
(TA:) or it is of the measure فَعَلَةٌ, (M, K,)
accord. to Kh; (M;) originally أَوَيَةٌ; (S;) [for,
accord. to J and Fei,] Sb said that its medial
radical letter is و, and that the final is ى, because
words of this class are more common than those
of which the medial and final radical letters are
both ى; (S, Msb;) and the rel. n. is أَوَوِىُّ: (S:)
but IB says, Sb did not state that the medial
radical letter of آيَةٌ is و, as J states; but he said
that it is originally أَيَةٌ, and that the quiescent و
is changed into ا; and he relates of Kh, that he
allowed the rel. n. of آيَةٌ to be ↓ آئِىٌّ and ↓ آيِىٌّ and
آوِىٌّ; but as to أَوَوِىٌّ, he says, I know not any
one who has said it except J: (TA:) or it is
of the measure فَاعِلَةٌ, (S, Msb, K,) originally آيَيَةٌ,
contracted by the suppression of its final radical
letter [with the preceding kesreh]: so accord. to
Fr: [but see what follows (after the pls.), where
this is said to be the opinion of Ks, and disallowed
by Fr:] (S, Msb:) the pl. is آيَاتٌ and ↓ آىٌ, (S, M,
Msb, K,) [or the latter is rather a coll. gen. n.,]
and pl. pl. آيَآءٌ: (M, K:) J says that one of its
pls. is آيَاىٌ; [and we find the same also in some
copies of the K;] but this is a mistake for آيَآءٌ,
which is pl. of آىٌ, not of آيَةٌ: (IB, TA:) and
this pl., being of the measure أَفْعَالٌ, has been
adduced as evidence that the medial radical letter
is ى, not و: (TA:) the dim. is ↓ إِيَيَّةٌ, [of the
measure فُعَيلَةٌ changed to فعَيْلَةٌ because of the
medial radical ى,] which, accord. to Fr, shows
the opinion of Ks, that آيَةٌ is of the measure فَاعِلَةٌ
rendered defective by the suppression of its final
radical letter, to be incorrect, because [Fr holds, in
opposition to some others, that] a noun of this measure has not its dim. formed on the measure فُعَيْلَةٌ
unless it is a proper name. (T.) They said,
اِفْعَلْهُ بِآيَةِ كَذَا [Do thou it at the sign of such a
thing]; like as you say, بِعَلَامَةِ كَذَا and بِأَمَارَةِ.
(M.) And [in this sense, as is indicated by the
context in the M,] it is one of the nouns that are
prefixed to verbs [as virtually governing the gen.
case], (M, K, *) because of the nearness of its
meaning to the meaning of time: (K:) as in the
saying [of a poet],
بِآيَةِ تُقْدِمُونَ الخَيْلَ شُعْثًا
[At the sign of your urging forward the horses,
unsmoothed in their coats, or not curried; which
means nearly the same as “at the time of your
urging” &c.]. (M.) ―
-b2-  A sign as meaning an
indication, an evidence, or a proof. (TA.) ―
-b3-  A
sign as meaning a miracle; [and a wonder; for]
آيَاتُ اللّٰهِ means the wonders of God. (TA.) ―
-b4-
An example, or a warning; (Fr, T, M, Msb, K;)
as, for instance, the case of Joseph and his brethren, related in the Kur: (Fr, T:) pl. ↓ آىٌ (M,
K) and آيَاتٌ. (Fr, T.) ―
-b5-  A message, or communication sent from one person or party to another;
syn. رِسَالَةٌ. (TA.) ―
-b6-  The body, or corporeal
form or figure or substance, (S, M, K,) of a man,
(S,) which one sees from a distance; [as being a
kind of sign;] or a person, or an individual;
syn. شَخْصٌ. (S, M, K.) ―
-b7-  A whole company
of people: as in the saying, خَرَجَ القَوْمُ بِآيَتِهِمْ The
people, or party, went forth with their whole
company, not leaving behind them anything.
(AA, S, M.) ―
-b8-  [Hence, accord. to some, A
verse of the Kur-án; as being] a collection of
words of the Book of God: (S:) or a connected
form of words of the Kur-án continued to its
breaking off; (K, TA;) accord. to Aboo-Bekr,
so called because it is a sign of the breaking off:
(TA:) or a portion of the Kur-án after which a
suspension of speech is approvable: (Msb:) or a
portion of the Kur-án denoting any statute, or
ordinance, of God, whether it be [what is generally termed] an آيَة, [i. e. a verse,] or a chapter
(سُورَة), or an aggregate [and distinct] portion of
the latter. (Er-Rághib, Kull, TA. *) [الآيَةَ,
written after a quotation of a part of a verse of
the Kur-án, means اِقْرَأِ الآيَةض Read thou the verse.]
