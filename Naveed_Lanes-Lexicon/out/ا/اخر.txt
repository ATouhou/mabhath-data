ex. of the latter occurs in a saying of Mohammad
to 'Omar: عَنّىِ ↓ أَخِّرْ Retire thou from me: or
the meaning is, أَخِّرْعَنِّى رَأْيَكَ [hold thou back
from me thine opinion; or reserve thou thine
opinion until after mine shall have been given].
(TA.) You say, تَأَخِّرَ عَنْهُ تَأَخُّرَةً وَاحِدَةً [He went

سَاعَةً ↓ أَجَلُهُمْ لَا يَسْتَأْخِرُونَ, in the Kur vii. 32 and
other places, means And when their time is come,
for punishment, they will not remain behind, or
be respited, [any while, or] the shortest time: or

إِسْتَاْخَرَ see 5, in three places.
أَخِرٌ [an epithet variously explained]. One
says, in reviling, (S, TA,) but not when the
object is a female, (TA,) أَبْعَدَ اَللّٰهُ الأَخِرَ, (Th, S,
A, &c.,) and ↓ الآخِرَ (M, &c.,) or this latter is
wrong, (Meshárik of 'Iyád, Mgh, Msb,) as is
also ↓ الآخَرَ, (Meshárik of 'Iyád,) meaning (tropical:)  May
God alienate, or estrange, from good, or prosperity, or may God curse, him who is absent
from us, (A, Msb, TA,) distant, or remote:
(A, Msb:) or the outcast; the alienated: (Msb:)
or him who is put back, and cast away: so says
Sh: or, accord. to ISh, him who is put back,
and remote from good: and he adds, I think
that ↓ الأَخِير is meant: (L:) or the base fellow :
or the most ignoble: or the miserable wretch:
(Et-Tedmuree and others:) or the last speaker:
(Nawádir of Th:) or الاخر is here a metonymy
for the devil: (Lb:) it is a word used [for the
reason explained voce أَبْعَدُ] in relating what has
been said by one of two persons cursing each
other, to the other; (Expositions of the Fs;)
and the phrase above mentioned is meant to
imply a prayer for those who are present [by
its contrasting them with the person to whom it
directly applies]. (A.) One also says, لَا مَرْحَبًا
بِالْأَخِرِ, [alluding to a particular person,] meaning
[May the place, or land, not be ample, or spacious,
or roomy,] to the remote from good. (TA.) It
is said in a trad. of Mázin, إِنَّ الأَخِرَقَدْ زَنَى
Verily the outcast, (Mgh, Msb,) or he who is
remote, and held back, from good,, (Mgh, * TA,)
hath committed adultery, or fornication: the
speaker meaning himself; (Mgh, Msb;) as
though he were an outcast. (Msb.) And in
another trad. it is said, المَسْأَلَةُ أَخِرُ كَسْبِ المَرْءِ
Begging is the most ignoble [mode of] gain of
man: but El-Khattábee relates it with medd,
[i. e. ↓ آخِرُ,] explaining it as meaning begging is
the last thing whereby man seeks sustenance when
unable to gain [by other means]. (TA.)
أُخُرٌ The back, hinder, or latter, part: the
hindermost, or last, part: contr. of قُدُمٌ. (K.)
[See also مُؤَخَّرٌ; from which it appears to be
distinguished by its being used only adverbially,
or with a preposition: and see آخِرٌ.] You say,
شُقَّ ثَوْبُهُ أُخُرًا, and مِنْ أُخُرٍ, (S, K, *) His garment
was rent, or slit, in its back, or hinder, part,
(S,) or behind. (K.) And تَأَخَّرَ أُخُرًا [He retired backwards]. (A.) And جَآءِ أُخُرًا: see آخِرٌ,
in two places.
أُخْرَةً and بِأُخْرَةٍ: see آخِرً.
أَخَرَةً and بِأَخَرَةٍ: see آخِرٌ, in five places.
بِعْتُهُ بِأَخِرَةٍ I sold it (namely the article of
merchandise, TA) with postponement of the payment; upon credit; for payment to be made at
a future period; syn. بِنَظِرةٍ; (S, A, K;) i. e.
بِنَسِئَةٍ. (S.)
أُخَرَةً and بِأُخَرَةٍ: see آخِرٌ.
أُخْرَاةٌ: see آخَرُ, of which it is the fem.: and
see also آخِرٌ.
أُخْرَاةٌ another fem. of آخَرُ. (K.)
أُخْرِيَّا and إِخْرِيَّا and إِخِرِيَّا: see آخِرٌ.
[
أُخْرَوِىٌّ and أُخْرَاوِىُّ Relating to the other state
of existence, or the world to come.]
أَخِيرٌ and أَخِيرًا: see آخِرٌ, in five places. See
also أَخِرٌ.
أُخَيْرَى dim. of أُخْرَى, fem. of آخَرُ, q. v. (S.)
آخَرُ a subst., of the measure أَفْعَلُ, but implying
the meaning of an epithet, (S,) from أَخَّرَ in the
sense of تَأَخَّرَ, (TA,) Another; the other; a
thing [or person] other than the former or first;
(L;) i. q. غَيْرٌ; (K;) as in the phrases, رَجُلٌ آخَرُ
another man, and ثَوْبٌ آخَرُ another garment or
piece of cloth: (TA:) or one of two things
[or persons]; (S, Sgh, Msb;) as when you say,
جَآءَ القَوْمُ فَوَاحِدٌ يَفْعَلُ كَذَا وَآخَرُ كَذَا The people
came, and one was doing thus, and one [i. e.
another] thus: (Sgh, Msb:) originally meaning
more backward: (TA:) fem. ↓ أُخْرَى (S, Msb,
K) and ↓ أُخْرَاةٌ; (K) which latter is not well
known: (MF:) pl. masc. آخَرُونَ and أُخَرُ; (S,
K;) [the latter irreg. as such;] and, applied to
irrational things, أَوَاخِرُ, like as أَفَاضِلُ is pl. of
أَفْضَلُ: (Msb:) and pl. fem. إُخْرَيَاتٌ and إُخَرُ;
(S, Msb, K;) which latter is imperfectly decl.;
for an epithet of the measure أَفْعَلُ which is accompanied by مِنْ has no [dual nor] pl. nor fem.
as long as it is indeterminate; but when it has
the article ال prefixed to it, or is itself prefixed
to another noun which it governs in the gen. case,
it has a dual and a pl. and a fem.; but it is not
so with آخَرُ; for it has a fem. [and dual] and pl.
without مِنْ and without the article ال and without its being prefixed to another noun: you say,
مَرَرْتُ بِرَخُلٍ آخَرَ, and بِرِجَالٍ أُخَرَ and آخَرِينَ,
and بِاٌمْرَأَةٍ, and بِنِسْوَةٍ [I passed by
another man, and by other men, and by another
woman, and by other women;] therefore, as it
[namely إُخَرُ] is thus made to deviate from its
original form, [i. e. آخَرُ, (I' Ak p. 287,) which
is of a class of words used, when indeterminate,
alike as sing. and dual and pl.,] and is [essentially
and originally] an epithet, it is imperfectly decl.,
though a pl.: but when you name thereby a man,
it is perfectly decl., when inderminate, accord. to
Akh, or imperfectly decl. accord. to Sb. (S, L.)
The dim. of آخَرُ is ↓ أُوَيْخِرُ; the ا with the ء
suppressed following the same rule as the ا in
ضَارِبٌ: (TA:) and the dim. of إُخْرَى is ↓ أُخَيْرَى.
(S.) See also الأُخْرَى voce آخِرٌ. ―
-b2-  لَا أَفْعَلُهُ أُخْرَى
اللَّيَالِى, (S, K,) or اخرى المَنُونِ, (K,) means I
will not do it ever: (S, K:) or the latter, I will
not do it to the end of time. (S.) And أُخْرَى
القَوْمِ, The last of the people. (S, K.) One says,
جَآءَ فِى أُخْرَى القَوْمِ He came among the last of
the people. (TA.) And جَآءِ فِى أُخْرَيَاتِ النَّاسِ
He came among those who were the last of the
people. (S, A, K.) [See also آخِرٌ.] ―
-b3-  In أَبْعَدَ
اللّٰهُ الآخَرَ, the last word is a mistake for الأَخِرَ
q. v. (Meshárik of 'Iyád.)
آخِرٌ, (S, Msb, K,) an epithet, of the measure
فَاعِلٌ, (S,) and ↓ أَخِيرٌ, (S, Msb,) The last; aftermost; hindmost: and the latter; after; hinder:
and [as a subst.] the end: contr. of أَوَّلُ: [or of
أَوَّلٌ when used as a subst.:] (A, Msb, K:) or of
مُتَقَدِّمٌ: (Lth, Msb:) or what is after the first or
former: (S:) fem. of the former آخِرَةٌ: (S, Msb,
K:) pl. [masc.] آخِرُونَ (Kur xxvi. 84, &c.,) and
(masc. and fem., Msb) أَوَاخِرُ (S, Msb) and fem.
آخِرَاتٌ also: (Th:) and ↓ مَآخِيرُ is syn. with
أَوَاخِرُ; as in مَآخِيرُاللَّيْلِ [occurring in the S and
K in art. جهم, meaning The last, or latter, parts,
or portions, of the night]. (TK in art. جهم.)
You say, جَآءِ آخِرًا and ↓ أَخِيرًا and ↓ أُخُرًا and
↓ بِأَخَرَةٍ, all meaning the same [He came lastly, or
latterly]: and in like manner, ↓ مَا عَرَفْتُهُ إِلَّا أَخِيرًا
and ↓ الّا بِأَخَرَةٍ [I did not know it save at the last,
or lastly, or latterly]: (S:) or ↓ جَآءِ أَخِيرًا and
↓ أُخُرًا and ↓ أَخْرَةٌ and ↓ بِأُخْرَةٍ and ↓ أُخَرَةٍ and
↓ بِأُخَرَةٍ (K,) or ↓ أُخْرَةٌ and ↓ بِأُخْرَةٍ (Lh, L,) and
بِآخِرَةٍ (TA) and ↓ إِخْرِيَّا and ↓ أُخْرِيَّا and ↓ إِخِرِيَّا
and ↓ آخِرِيَّا (K) mean he came lastly of everything.
(K.) It is said in a trad., respecting Mohammad,
إِذَا أَرَادَ أَنْ يَقُومَ مِنَ المَجْلِسِ ↓ كَانَ يَقُولُ بِأَخَرَةٍ
كَذَا وَكَذَا He used to say, at the end of his sitting,
when he desired to rise from the place of assembly,
thus and thus: or, accord. to IAth, it may mean,
in the last, or latter, part of his life. (TA.) And
you say, أَتَيْتُكَ آخِرَ مَرَّتَيْنِ and آخِرَ مَرَّتَيْنِ (IAar,
M, K. *) And لَا أُكَلِّمُهُ آخِرَ الدَّهْرِ I will not
speak to him [to the end of time, or] ever. (A.)
[See a similar phrase above, voce آخَرُ.] And
جَاؤُوا عَنْ آخِرِهِمْ [They came with the last of
them; عن being here syn. with بِ; meaning
they came all, without exception]. (A.) [And
كَانَ ذلِكَ فِى آخِرِ الشَّهْرِ, and السَّنَةِ; and فى
أَوَاخِرِ هِمَا, That was in the end of the month, and
of the year; and in the last days thereof.] And

an epithet in which the quality of a subst. predominates. (Z, and Bd ubi suprà.) [Opposed to
الدُّنْيَا. And آخِرَةٌ also signifies The enjoyments,
