of untanned hide, (S, A,) by tying the two extremities of the عَرْقُوْتَانِ of the camel's saddle, or
of the curved pieces of wood of the horse's saddle.
(A.) ―
-b2-  Also, aor. as above, and so the inf. n.,
i. e. أَسْرٌ (S, Msb) and إِسَارٌ, (Lth, S,) He made
him a captive; captived him; or took him a
prisoner; whether he bound him with an إِسَار
or did not; (S;) as also ↓ آسرهُ, of the same form
as أَكْرَمَ; (Msb;) and ↓ استأسرهُ, accord. to a
trad., in which it occurs thus used, transitively:
(Mgh:) and he imprisoned him. (TA, from a
trad.) ―
-b3-  Also, (S, Msb,) inf. n. أَسْرٌ, (Msb,)
(assumed tropical:)  He (God) created him, or formed him, (S,
Msb,) in a goodly manner. (Msb.) You say,

names no authority.)]
4
آسَرَ see 1.
5
تأسّر عَلَيْهِ فُلَانٌ (assumed tropical:)  Such a one excused himself
to him, and was slow, or tardy: (AZ, T, K:*)
thus as related by Ibn-Hánee from AZ: as
A'Obeyd relates it from him, تأسن; but this is a
mistake: it is correctly with ر. (T.)
8
يَأْتَسِرُ, inf. n. ائْتِسَارٌ [written with the disjunctive alif اِيتِسَارٌ]; for يَتَّسِرُ, inf. N. اتِّسَارٌ: see

أَسْرٌ i. q. إِسَارٌ, q. v. (S.) Hence the saying,
هٰذَا الشَّىْءُ لَكَ بِأَسْرِهِ This thing is for thee, or is
thine,[lit.] with its thong of untanned hide
[wherewith it is bound]; meaning, altogether;
like as one says, بِرُمَّتِهِ. (S.) And خُذْهُ بِأَسْرِهِ

جَآءَ القَوْمُ بِأَسْرِهِمْ The people came altogether.
(Aboo-Bekr.) ―
-b2-  Strength of make, or form. (M,
K.) [Accord. to the copies of the K in my
hands, it also signifies Strength of natural disposition; but instead of وَالخُلُق, in those copies,
we should read وَالخَلْقُ, agreeably with other
lexicons, as is implied in the TA: see 1.] You
say, فُلَانٌ شَدِيدٌ أَسْرٍ الخَلْقِ (tropical:)  Such a one is of
strong, firm, or compact, make, or form. (TA.)
―
-b3-  شَدَدْنَا أَسْرَهُمْ, in the Kur [lxxvi. 28], means
(tropical:)  We have strengthened their make, or form:
(S, A, Msb:) or, their joints: or, their two
sphincters which serve as repressers of the urine
and feces (مَصَرَّتَىِ البَوْلِ وَ الغَائِطِ), which contract
when the excrement has passed forth; or the
meaning is, that these two things do not become
relaxed before one desires. (IAar, K.)
أُسْرٌ, (S, M, IKtt, A,) a subst., (M, IKtt,) as
also ↓ أُسُرٌ, (M, Lb,) meaning Suppression of the
urine: (S, M, &c.:) suppression of the feces
is termed حُصْرٌ: (S:) or a dribbling of the urine,
with a cutting pain in the bladder, and pangs
like those of a female in the time of parturition.
(IAar.) You say, أَخَذَهُ الأَسْرُ [Suppression of
urine, &c., took him, or affected him]. (A.) And
أَنَالَهُ اللّٰهُ أُسْراً [May God give him a suppression
of urine, &c.]: a form of imprecation. (A.) ―
-b2-
Hence, (M,) عُودُ أُسْرٍ (IAar, S, M, A, K) and
عُودٌ أُسْرٌ and عُودُ الأُسْرِ (Expositions of the Fs)
and عُودُ يُسْرِ, (IAar, K,) or this is a corruption,
(K,) or a vulgar mistake, (A,) and should not
be said, (Fr, S, A,) unless meant to be used as
ominous of good, (A,) A stick, or piece of wood,
which is put upon the belly of a man affected by
a suppression of his urine, (S, A, K, &c.,) and
which cures him. (A.)
أُسُرٌ: see أُسْرٌ.
أُسْرَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  A man's kinsmen that are more, or  most,
nearly related to him; his near kinsmen: (S, *
M, A, * Msb, * K:) or a man's nearer, or nearest,
relations on his father's side: (Aboo-Jaafar En-Nahhás:) so called because he is strengthened
by them. (S, A.)
إِسَارٌ A thing with which one binds; (M, K;)
a thong of untanned hide, (S, A, Msb,) with
which one binds a camel's saddle, (As, S,) [as
also إِصَارٌ,] and a captive; and so أَسْرٌ, q. v.:
(S:) and a rope, or cord, with which a captive
is bound: and a pair of shackles: (TA:) pl.
أُسُرٌ. (M, K.) [See also 1.] You say, حَلَّ إِسَارَهُ
فَأَطْلَقَهُ He untied his thong of untanned hide
wherewith he was bound, and released him. (A.)
-A2-  See also أَسِيرٌ.
أَسِيرٌ i. q. ↓ مَأْسُورٌ; (S, TA;) Bound with an
إِسَار: (M, TA:) shackled: (K:) imprisoned:
(Mujáhid, M, K:) captived, or a captive; (S,
M, K;) absolutely, (TA,) although not bound
with an اسار: (S:) and ↓ إِسَارٌ is sometimes used
in the same sense. (Msb.) اسير is also applied as
an epithet to a woman, (Mgh, Msb,) when the
woman is mentioned; but otherwise أَسِيرَةٌ is used
as the fem.: you say, قَتَلْتُ الأَسِيرَةَ [I slew the
female captive], like as you say, رَأَيْتُ القَتِيلَةَ.
(Msb.) The pl. is أَسْرَى (S, M, Msb, K) and
أَسَرَآءُ (M, K) and (accord. to several authors, pls.
of أَسْرَى, TA) أُسَارَى (S, M, Msb, K) and أَسَارَى:
(M, K:) the first of these forms of pl. is proper
to epithets applied to those who are hurt or
afflicted in their bodies or their intellects: (Aboo-Is-hák:) it is used in this instance because a
captive is like one wounded or stung. (Th, M.)
تَآسِيرُ السَّرْجِ [in the CK, erroneously, تَأْسِير]
The thongs of the horse's saddle, whereby it is
bound: (K:) accord. to the more correct opinion,
a pl. without a sing. (MF.)
مَأْسُورٌ: see أَسِيرٌ. A camel's saddle bound with
an إِسَار: pl. مَآسِيرُ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  A man, and a
beast, having strongly-knit joints. (M.) ―
-b3-  A
man suffering suppression of his urine. (S.)
