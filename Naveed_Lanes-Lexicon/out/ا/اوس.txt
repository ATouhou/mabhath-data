اوسآسٌ [The myrtle;] a certain kind of tree,
(S, Msb, K,) well known, (S, K,) fragrant,
(IDrd, M, Msb,) and evergreen, abundant in the
land of the Arabs, growing in the plains and
mountains, and increasing so as to become a great
tree: (AHn, M, TA:) n. un. with ة: (AHn,
M, Msb, K:) IDrd says, I think it an adventitious
word, although used by the Arabs, and occurring
in chaste poetry. (M, TA.)
