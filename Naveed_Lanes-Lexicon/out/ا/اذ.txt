اذإِذْ a word denoting past time: (Lth, T, S, M,
L, Mughnee, K:) it is a noun, (S, L, Mughnee,
K,) indecl., with its last letter quiescent; and
properly is prefixed to a proposition; (S, L, K;)
as in جِئْتُكَ إِذْ قَامَ زَيدٌ [I came to thee when Zeyd
stood], and إِذْ زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ and إِذْ زَيْدٌ يقُومُ [When
Zeyd was standing]. (S, L.) The proposition to
which it is prefixed is either nominal, as in [the
words of the Kur viii. 26,] وَاذْكُرُوا إِذْ أَنْتُمْ قَلِيلٌ
[And remember ye when ye were few]; or verbal,
having the verb in the pret. as to the letter and
as to the meaning, as in [the Kur ii. 28, &c.,]
وَإِذْ قَالَ رَبُّكَ لِلْمَلَائِكَةِ [And when thy Lord said
unto the angels]; or verbal with the verb in the
pret. as to the meaning but not as to the letter, as
in [the Kur ii. 121,] وَ إِذْ يَرْفَعُ إِبْرٰهِيمُ القَوَاعِدَ
[And when Abraham was rearing the foundations]; all three of which kinds are comprised in
the Kur where it is said, [ix. 40,] إِلَّا تَنْصُرُوهُ فَقَدْ
نَصَرَهُ اللّٰهُ إِذْ أَخْرَجَهُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا ثَانِىَ اثْنَيْنِ إِذْ هُمَا
فِى الغَارِ إِذْ يَقُولُ لِصَاحِبِهِ لَا تَحزَنْ إِنَّ اللّٰهَ مَعَنَا
[If ye will not aid him, verily God aided him,
when those who disbelieved expelled him, being the
second of two, when they two were in the cave,
when he was saying to his companion, Grieve not
thou, for God is with us]. (Mughnee.) But
sometimes one half of the proposition is suppressed,
as in إِذْ ذَاكَ, [also written إِذَّاكَ,] meaning إِذْ ذَاكَ
كَذٰلِكَ [When that was so], or إِذْ ذَاكَ كَائِنٌ
[When that was, i. e. then, at that time]. (Mughnee.) And sometimes the whole of the proposition
is suppressed, (M, Mughnee,) as being known,
(Mughnee,) and tenween is substituted for it; the
ذ receiving kesreh because of the occurrence of
two quiescent letters together, (M, Mughnee,)
namely the ذ and the tenween, (M,) and thus one
says, يَوْمَئِذٍ; the kesreh of the ذ not being, as
Akh holds it to be, the kesreh of declension,
although اذ here occupies the place of a noun
governed in the gen. case by another prefixed to
it, (M, Mughnee,) for it still requires a proposition
to be understood after it, (Mughnee,) and is held
to be indecl. (M, Mughnee) by general consent,
like كَمْ and مَنْ, (M,) as being composed of two
letters. (Mughnee.) [J says,] when إِذْ is not
prefixed to a proposition, it has tenween: (S:)
and hence Aboo-Dhu-eyb says, (S, M,)
نَهَيْتُكَ عَنْ طِلَابِكَ أُمَّ عَمْرٍو
بِعَافِيَةٍ وَأَنْتَ إِذٍ صَحِيحُ
[I forbade thy suing Umm-'Amr in health, thou
being then sound]; (S, M, L, Mughnee, TA; [but
in two copies of the S, for بِعَافِيَةٍ, I find بِعَاقِبَةٍ;
and in the L it is without any point;]) in which
[J says] the poet means حِينَئِذٍ, like as one says
يَوْمَئذٍ and لَيْلَتَئِذٍ: (S:) and Fr says that some of
the Arabs say, كَانَ كَذَا و كَذَا وَهُوَ إِذٍ صَبِىٌّ,
meaning هُوَ إِذْ ذَاكَ صَبِىٌّ [Such and such things
were, he being then a boy]. (T.) إِذِى also occurs
for اذ [app. إِذٍ, but whether this or إِذْ is not clear
in the MS. from which I take this]. (M.) When
إِذٍ is adjoined to nouns signifying times, the Arabs
join it therewith in writing, in certain instances:
namely حِينَئِذٍ [At that time, or then], and يَوْمَئِذٍ
[In, or on, or at, that day], and لَيْلَتَئِذٍ [In, or
on, or at, that night], and غَدَاتَئِذٍ [In, or on,
that morning], and عَشِيَّتَئِذٍ [In, or on, that evening], and سَاعَتَئِذٍ [In that hour: or at that time;
then], and عَامَئِذٍ [In that year], [and وَقْتَئِذٍ At
that time; then]; but they did not say الآنَئِذٍ,
because الآنَ denotes the nearest present time,
except in the dial. of Hudheyl, in which it has
been found to occur. (T.) When it is followed by
a verb, or by a noun not having the article ال prefixed to it, or [rather] by any movent letter, the
ذ of إِذْ is quieseent; but when it is followed by a
noun with ال, [or by any ا,] the ذ is mejroorah,
as in the saying,
إِذِ القَوْمُ كَانُوا نَازِلِينَ بِكَاظِمَهْ
[When the people, or company of men, were
alighting, or taking up their abode, at Kádhimeh].
(T.) ―
-b2-  In general, (Mughnee, K,) it is an adverbial noun denoting past time, (M, Mughnee,
K,) when it is a noun denoting such time,
(Mughnee, K,) as in وَ إِذْ قَالَ رَبُّكَ لِلْمَلَائِكَةِ [explained above], (M,) and in فَقَدْ نَصَرَهُ اللّٰهُ إِذْ
أَخْرَجَهُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا [also explained above, and in
other instances already mentioned]: (Mughnee,
K:) in the former of which instances, AO says
that it is redundant; (M, Mughnee;) but Aboo-Is-hák says that this is a bold assertion of his;
(M;) [and IHsh says,] this assertion is of no
account, and so is that of him who says that it
here denotes certainty, like قَدْ: (Mughnee:) [J
holds the opinion of AO on this point; for he
says,] إِذْ is sometimes redundant, like إِذَا, as in
the saying in the Kur [ii. 48], وَإِذْ وَاعَدْنَا مُوسَى,
meaning وَوَاعَدْنَا مُوسَى [And We appointed a
time with Moses; but instances of this kind are
most probably elliptical: see the next sentence].
(S.) As a noun denoting past time, it is [said to
be] also an objective complement of a verb, as in
[the Kur vii. 84,] وَاذْكُرُوا إِذْ كُنْتُمْ قَلِيلاً [And
remember ye when ye were few]: (Mughnee, K:)
and generally in the commencements of narratives
in the Kur, it may be an objective complement of
أُذْكُرْ understood, as in وَ إِذْ قَالَ رَبُّكَ لِلْمَلَائِكَةِ
[before cited], and the like. (Mughnee: but see
the third of the sentences here following.) As
such, it is [said to be] also a substitute for the
objective complement of a verb, as in [the Kur
xix. 16,] وَ اذْكُرْ فِى الْكِتَابِ مَرْيَمَ إِذِ انْتَبَذَتْ [And
mention thou, or remember thou, in the Scripture,
Mary, the time when she withdrew aside], where
اذ is a substitute of implication for مريم. (Mughnee, K: but see the second of the sentences here
following.) As such, it also has prefixed to it a
noun of time, of such a kind that it is without
need thereof, as in يَوْمَئِذٍ, or not of such a kind
that it is without need thereof, as in [the Kur iii. 6,]
بَعْدَ إِذْ هَدَيْتَنَا [After the time when Thou hast
directed us aright]. (Mughnee, K.) And it is
generally asserted, that it never occurs otherwise
than as an adverbial noun, or as having a noun
prefixed to it; that in the like of وَاذْكُرُوا إِذْ كُنْتُمْ
قَلِيلاً, it is an adverbial noun relating to an objective complement suppressed, i. e. وَ اذْكُرُوا نِعْمَةَ اللّٰهِ
عَلَيْكُمْ إِذْ كُنْتُمْ قَلِيلاً [And remember ye the grace
of God towards you when ye were few]; and in
the like of إِذِ انْتَبَذَتْ, that it is an adverbial noun
relating to a suppressed prefixed noun to [that
which becomes by the suppression] the objective
complement of a verb, i. e. [in this instance]
وَ اذْكُرْ قِصَّةَ مَرْيَمَ [And mention thou, or remember thou, the case of Mary]: and this assertion
is strengthened by the express mention of the
[proper] objective complement in [the Kur iii. 98,]
وَ اذْكُروا نِعْمَةَ اللّٰهِ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذْ كُنْتُمْ أَعْدَآءً [And remember ye the grace of God towards you when ye
were enemies]. (Mughnee.) ―
-b3-  Also, (Mughnee,
K,) accord. to some, (T, Mughnee,) it is used (T,
Mughnee, K) as a noun (Mughnee, K) to indicate future time, (T, Mughnee, K,) and إِذَا is
said to denote past time, (T,) [i. e.] each of these
occurs in the place of the other; (TA;) the former
being used to indicate future time in the Kur
[xxxiv. 50], where it is said, وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذْ فَزِعُوا
[And couldst thou see the time when they shall be
terrified], meaning the day of resurrection; this
usage being allowable, says Fr, only because the
proposition is like one expressing a positive fact,
since there is no doubt of the coming of that day;
(T;) and in [the Kur xcix. 4,] يَوْمَئِذٍ تُحَدِّثُ أَخْبَارَهَا
[On that day, she (the earth) shall tell her tidings];
(Mughnee, K;) this being generally regarded as
similar to the expression of a future event which
must necessarily happen as though it had already
happened; but it may be urged in favour of those
who hold a different opinion that it is said in the
Kur [xl. 72 and 73], فَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ إِذِ الأَغلَالُ فِى
أَعْنَاقِهِمْ [They shall hereafter know, when the
collars shall be on their necks]; for يعلمون is a
future as to the letter and the meaning because of
its having سوف conjoined with it, and it governs
اذ, which is therefore in the place of إِذَا. (Mughnee.) ―
-b4-  It also indicates a cause, as in [the Kur
xliii. 38,] لَنْ يَنْفَعَكُمُ الْيَوْمَ إِذْ ظَلَمْتُمْ [It will not
profit you this day, since, or because, ye have
acted wrongfully], (Mughnee, K,) i. e. because
of your having acted wrongfully in the sublunary
state of existence; (Bd, Mughnee;) but it is disputed whether it be in this instance a particle in
the place of the causative ل, or an adverbial
noun: (Mughnee:) Aboo-'Alee seems to hold
that اذ ظلمتم [as meaning when ye have acted
wrongfully] is a substitute for, or a kind of repetition of, اليوم; an event happening in the present
world being spoken of as though it happened in
the world to come because the latter immediately
follows the former. (IJ, M, L, Mughnee.) You
say also, الحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ إِذْ جِئْتَ [Praise be to God
because, or that, thou camest, or hast come]. (S
in art. جيأ.) ―
-b5-  It is also used to denote one's
experiencing the occurrence of a thing when he
is in a particular state; (S, L;) or to denote a
thing's happening suddenly, or unexpectedly; (S,
Mughnee, K;) like إِذَا; (S;) and in this case is
only followed by a verb expressing an event as a
positive fact, (S, L,) and occurs after بَيْنَا and بَيْنَمَا;
(Mughnee, K;) as [in exs. voce بَيْنَ; and] in
بَيْنَمَا أَنَا كَذَا إِذْ جَآءَ زَيْدٌ [While I was thus, or in
this state, lo, or behold, or there, or then, at that
time, (accord. to different authorities, as will be
seen below,) Zeyd came]; (S, L;) and as in the
saying of a poet,
اِسْتَقْدِرِ اللّٰهَ خَيْراً وَارْضَيَنَّ بِهِ
فَبَيْنَمَاالْعُسْرُ إِذ دَارَتْ مَيَاسِيرُ
[Beg thou God to appoint for thee good, and do
thou be content therewith; for while there has
been difficulty, lo, easy circumstances have come
about]: (Mughnee, K: *) but it is disputed whether it be [in this case] an adverbial noun of
place, (Mughnee, K,) as Zj and AHei hold;
(TA;) or of time, (Mughnee, K,) as Mbr holds;
(TA;) or a particle denoting the sudden, or
unexpected, occurrence of a thing, (Mughnee, K,)
as IB and Ibn-Málik hold; (TA;) or a corroborative, i. e. [grammatically] redundant, particle,
(Mughnee, K,) an opinion which Ibn-Ya'eesh
holds, and to which Er-Radee inclines. (TA.) ―
-b6-
It is also a conditional particle, but only used as
such coupled with ما, (S, L, Mughnee, *) and
causes two aorists to assume the mejzoom form,
(Mughnee,) as when you say, إِذْمَا تَأْتِنِى آتِكَ
[When, or whenever, thou shalt come to me, I
will come to thee], like as you say, إِنْ تأْتِنِى وَقْتًا
آتِكَ [If thou come to me at some, or any, time, I
will come to thee]; and you say also إِذْمَا أَتَيْتَ
[like as you say, إِنْ أَتَيْتَ, using the pret. in the
sense of the future]: (S, L:) it is a particle
accord. to Sb, used in the manner of the conditional إِنْ; but it is an adverbial noun accord. to
Mbr and Ibn-Es-Sarráj and El-Fárisee. (Mughnee.) ―
-b7-  [What I have translated from the S, L,
K, and TA, in this art., is mostly from فصل الهمزة
of باب الذال : the rest, from باب الالف اللينّة.]
