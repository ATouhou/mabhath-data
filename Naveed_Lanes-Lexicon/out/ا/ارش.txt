the saying mentioned by IAar, اِنْتَظِرْنِى حَتَّى
تَعْقِلَ فَلَيْسَ لَكَ عِنْدَنَا أَرْشٌ إِلَّا الأَسِنَّةُ [Wait thou
for me until thou accept a fine for a wound in

him and the seller. (TA.) ―
-b4-  A bribe. (Aboo-Nahshal, Sh, K.)

Then say thou to that man who is disquieted by
envy, and as though he were stung, Act thou
gently, for [there is no scarf-skin scratched;
meaning,] my honour is uninjured, having in
it no defect nor scratch. (L, * TA.)
