(KL, TA,) [as commonly used in the present
day,] He signed the writing [for the purpose of
giving effect to it, either beneath, or by endorsing
it]: (MA, KL:) [but as generally used in
earlier, though post-classical, times,] he annexed
to the writing, after it had been finished, for the
Sultán or the administrator of affairs, to whom
it had been submitted, something [for the purpose
of giving effect thereto]; as, for instance, when
a complaint is submitted to the Sultán or to the
administrator, and one writes beneath the writing
or on the back thereof, “Let the affair, or case,
of this person be looked into, and let his right,
or due, be fully exacted for this person: ” or,
accord. to Az, he wrote, upon the writing, a concise abstract, omitting redundances, of the objects
of want [petitioned for therein]: from تَوْقِيعُ
الدَّبَرِ ظَهْرَ البَعِيرِ [“ the gall's, or sore's, marking
the back of the camel ”]; as though the مُوَقِّع
