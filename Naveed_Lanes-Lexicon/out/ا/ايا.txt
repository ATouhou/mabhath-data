اياأَيَا a vocative particle, (S, M, K,) used in calling
him who is near and him who is distant: [in the
former case, like O: in the latter, like ho there,
or soho, or holla:] you say, أَيَا زَيْدُ أَقْبِلْ [O Zeyd,
advance: or ho there, or soho, or holla, &c.]:
(S:) or J is in error in saying this: it is used in
calling to him who is distant: (Mughnee, K:)
so say Ibn-El-Hájib, in the Káfiyeh, and ElFakhr El-Járabardee; and the latter adds, or
to him who is in a predicament like that of him
who is distant, being sleeping or inadvertent; the
person who calls thereby being eager for the
person called to advance to him: (TA:) or not
used in calling to him who is near: (K:) and ه
is substituted for its hemzeh; (M, K;) so that
one says, هَيَا. (M.) AZ says, I have heard them
say, أَيَا إِيَاهُ أَقْبِلْ. (T in بَابُ الأَلِفَاتِ.) [Accord.
to the TA, (art. ا,) one says also آيَا.]
إِيَا الشَّمْسِ, and النَّبَاتِ; and إِيَاة, and أَيَاة, and
أَيَّا: see art. اى.
إِيَّا (S, M, K, &c.) and أَيَّا, (M, K,) the latter
form used by some, as related on the authority
of Ktr; (M;) accord. to some, (M,) a noun of
vague signification, (S, M, K,) used metonymically for a noun in the accus. case, (M,) with
which are connected all the affixed pronouns that
denote the accus. case: you say إِيَّانا [Thee] and
إِيَّاهُ [him] and إِيَّاىَ [me] (S, K) and إِيَّانَا [us,
&c.]: (S:) and the hemzeh is changed into و, so
that you say وِيَّاكَ (S, M, K *) and وَيَّاكَ; (Ktr,
IJ, M, K; *) and sometimes into و, so that you
say وِيَّاكَ [and app. وَيَّاكَ also; both of which
are used by some of the Arabs in the present day,
very commonly in Egypt, for وَإِيَّاكَ as meaning
مَعَكَ; like as one says وَزَيْدًا, meaning مَعَ زَيْدٍ]:
(K:) the ك and ه and ى [&c.] are put to show
the object meant, in order that the person addressed may be known from the absent [&c.]; and
have no place in the analysis of a sentence, like
the ك in ذٰلِكَ and أَرَأَيْتَكَ: (S, M: in the former
of which is added, and like the ا and ن in أَنْتَ:)
and this is identical with the opinion of Akh:
(M, TA:) thus ايّا is the noun, and what follows it
is to denote allocution, [&c.,] and the two become
as one thing; for nouns of vague signification
are not prefixed to other nouns to govern them
in the gen. case, nor are any of the pronouns, being
themselves determinate. (S.) Ibn-Keysán says,
(S, M,) some of the grammarians say that إِيَّاكَ,
altogether, is a noun; and he adds, but some say
(M) that the ك and ه &c. are the nouns, and that
ايّا is a support thereto, because they cannot stand
by themselves, (S, M,) like the ك &c. which
occupy the latter place in يَضْرِبُكَ &c.; so when
the ك &c. are put first, [as in إِيَّاكَ ضَرَبْتُ Thee I
beat, or struck,] they are supported by ايا, and
the whole becomes as one thing: (S:) and you
may also say, ضَرَبْتُ إِيَّاىَ [I beat, or struck,
me]; because it is not allowable to say, ضَرَبْتُنِى:
(S as corrected by IB:) but you may not say,
ضَرَبْتُ إِيَّاكَ [I beat, or struck, thee]; because
you only require ايّاك when you cannot use the
ك [alone]; though you may say, ضَرَبْتُكَ إِيّاكَ [I
beat, or struck, thee, thee]; because the ك is made
to be syntactically dependent upon the verb, so
when you repeat it you require ايّا. (S.) In the
saying of the poet, (S,) Dhu-l-Isba' El-'Adwánee,
(TA,)
كَأَنَّايَوْمَ قُرَّى إِنَّمَا نَقْتُلُ إِيَّانَا
[As though we, on the day of Kurrà, only killed
ourselves], he has separated it from the verb only
because the Arabs do not make the action of the
agent to fall upon the agent itself by the adjunction of the pronoun: they do not say, قَتَلْتُنِى,
but only قَتَلْتُ نَفْسِى: so the poet has used
ايّانا in the same manner as أَنْفُسَنَا. (S, TA.)
Some of the grammarians say that إِيَّا is prefixed
to what follows it, governing it in the gen. case;
and adduce as an evidence thereof a saying which
see below, commencing with إِذَا بَلَغَ الرَّجُلُ. (S.)
Zj says that it is an explicit noun, [not a pronoun,]
which is prefixed to all the pronouns, governing
them in the gen. case; but only to pronouns;
so that if one said, إِيَّا زَيْدٍ حَدَّثْتُ, it would be
bad. (M.) Kh holds that it is a pronoun prefixed to the ك [&c.], governing it in the gen.
case; (M, K;) and the like is related to have
been the opinion of El-Mázinee: and Sb relates
of Kh that he said, if any one were to say إِيَّاكَ
نَفْسَكَ [Thee, thyself], I would not severely
blame him, for this ك is [virtually] governed in
the gen. case. (M.) But accord. to Akh, it is
a simple, or uncompounded, pronoun, the ending
of which becomes altered, as the endings of pronouns are wont to become, because of the varying
of the numbers of the persons using them; (M,
K; [in both of which the last of the word thus
rendered is المضمرين; accord. to a copy of the
M, المضمرين, i. e. المُضْمِرينَ; in a copy of the
K, without any syll. signs; and in the CK,
المُضْمَرَيْنِ; of which readings, I have followed
that found in the M; supposing the meaning to
be, that ايّا has different endings according as it
is used by one speaking to another, or by one
speaking of another, or by one speaking of himself, or to, or of, two or more, and the like;])
and the ك of ايَّاك is like the ك of ذٰلِكَ, inasmuch
as it is an indication of allocution only, divested
of the idea of its being a sign of the pronoun.
(M.) Of all these varying opinions, IJ says that
he has found none to be correct when investigated,
except that of Akh; with whose opinion, that
stated in the begining of this art. is identical
[except as to the affix, which is there said to be
a pronoun, not merely a particle of allocution].
(M, TA.) Zj, being asked to explain the meaning
of the phrase إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ, [in the Kur i. 4,] answered, حَقِيتَتَكَ نَعْبُدُ [Thine essence we worship];
and said that it is derived from آيَةٌ, meaning “a
sign by which a thing is known:” but IJ does
not approve of this. (M.) [Respecting the phrase,
فَإِذَا هُوَ إِيَّاهَا, in which ايّاها is used in the place
of a noun in the nom. case, and which is therefore disallowed by Sb, see إِذَا.] ―
-b2-  It is also
used for the purpose of cautioning, or putting one
on his guard. (T, S.) You say, إِيَّاكَ وَالأَسَدَ
[Beware thou of, or avoid thou, or remove thyself
far from, the lion]: it is a substitute for a verb;
as thou you said, بَاعِدْ: and you say also, هِيَّاكَ;
like as you say أَرَاقَ and هَرَاقَ: (S:) [or ايّاك in
this case is governed by a verb understood: for]
Ibn-Keysán says, when you say, إِيَّاكَ وَزَيْدًا
[Beware thou of, or avoid thou, or remove thyself
far from, Zeyd], you caution him whom you
address against Zeyd, and the verb governing the
accus. case is not apparent: the meaning is,
أُحَذِّرُكَ زَيْدًا [I caution thee against Zeyd]; as
though you said, أُحَذِّرُكَ إِيَّاكَ وَزَيْدًا [I caution
thee, thee with Zeyd]; or as though you said,
بَاعِدْ نَفْسَكَ عَنْ زَيْدٍ وَبَاعِد زَيْدًا عَنْكَ [Remove thyself far from Zeyd, and remove Zeyd far from
thee]; so that the verb governs the word signifying the person cautioned and that signifying him
against whom that person is cautioned: (TA:) [and
Az says,] when you say, إِيَّاكَ وَرُكُوبَ الفَاحِشَةِ, the
verb is suppressed: it is as though you said,
أُحَذِّرُكَ رُكُوبَ الفَاحِشَةِ [I caution thee against
the committing of that which exceeds the bounds
of rectitude]. (T.) Kh is related to have heard
an Arab of the desert say, (T, * M, the latter on the
authority of Sb.,) إِذَابَلَغَ الرَّجُلُ السِّتِّينَ فَإيَّاهُ وَإِيَّا
الشَّوابّ [When the man attains to sixty years,
I caution him against, or let him avoid, the
young women]; (T, S, M;) prefixing ايّا to
الشوابّ, and putting the latter in the gen. case:
(S:) but accord. to Akh, it is not allowable to
say [thus, or] إِيَّاكَ وَإِيَّا زَيْدٍ. (M.) Sometimes
the و is suppressed, as in the saying of the poet,
فَإِيَّاكَ إِيَّاكَ المِرَآءَ فَإِنَّهُ
إِلَى الشَّرِّ دَعَّآءٌ وَلِلشَّرِّ جَالِبُ
[Then avoid thou, avoid thou obstinate disputation, for it is wont to invite to evil, and an
attracter of evil]; meaning, إِيَّاكَ وَالمِرَآءَ: i. e.,
إِيَّاكَ وَأَنْ تُمَارِيَ. (TA.) You say [properly], إِيَّاكَ وَأَنْ
تَفْعَلَ كَذَا [Beware thou of, or avoid thou, doing
such a thing]: but [in strict propriety] you should
not say, إِيَّاكَ أَنْ تَفْعَلَ كَذَا, without و. (S.) See
also art. اي.
أَيَايَا (Lth, T, S, M, K) and أَيَايَهْ, (M,) or يَايَا,
(K,) and يَايَهْ, (M, K,) A cry by which camels
are chidden. (Lth, T, S, M, K.) [See 2 in art.
اي.]
