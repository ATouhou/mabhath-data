آنَ, [aor. يَئِينُ,] inf. n. أَيْنٌ, [in a copy of the
Msb, أَيِنَ, aor. يَاءَنُ, inf. n. أَيَنٌ, but as this is at
variance with all other authorities known to me,
I regard it as a mistranscription,] He was, or
became, fatigued, or tired: (T, M:) so says IAar:
(T:) and As says the like: (TA, from a marginal
note in a copy of the S:) [see also what I have
cited from the Mughnee voce إِنَّ, last sentence:]
in proof of this, IAar cites the following ex., from
a poet:
إِنَّا وَرَبِّ القُلُصِ الضَّوَامِرِ
[We were, or have become, fatigued, by the Lord
of the lean and lank-bellied youthful she-camels]:
but Lth says that there is no verb derived from
أَيْنٌ, in this sense, except in poetry: (T:) Aboo-Mohammad says that the only instance is that
cited above: (TA:) [it is not disputed that] أَيْنٌ
signifies fatigue, or the being fatigued or tired:
(S, K:) AZ says that it has no verb formed from
it; but on this point he has been contradicted:
(S:) A 'Obeyd also says that it has no verb.
(M.)
-A2-  آنَ, aor. يَئِينُ, inf. n. أَيْنٌ, (S, M, Msb,
K, &c., [but see what follows,]) also signifies Its
time came; (أَتَى وَقْتُهُ;) as also أَنَى: (Bd lvii. 15:)
it was, or became, present: it came, or attained,
to its time; to its full, or final, time, or state; to
maturity: it was, or became, or drew, near: syn.
أَنَى: (M:) and أَدْرَكَ; like أَنَى: (Ham p. 455:)
and حَانَ: (S, M, Msb, K:) and قَرُبَ. (Mughnee
voce إِنَّ.) You say, آنَ لَكَ أَنْ تَفْعَلَ كَذَا, aor.
and inf. n. as above, (AZ, S,) i. e. حَانَ [The time
has come, or has drawn near, for thee to do, or
that thou shouldst do, such a thing]; like أَنَى:
and it is formed from it by transposition: (S:)
[i. e.] أَنَى is formed by transposition from آنَ:
(Msb:) or آنَ is a dial. var. of أَنَى; not formed
from it by transposition, [nor is the reverse the
case,] because of the existence of the inf. n. [of
each]: (M:) or آنَ is formed by transposition
from أَنَى, because the latter has an inf. n. and the
former has not: so says As: for أَيْنٌ does not
belong to this; its meaning being only إِعْيَآءٌ and
تَعَبٌ: or, accord. to AZ, آنَ has an inf. n., namely
أَيْنٌ; and if the case be so, the two [verbs] are
equal; neither being the original of the other:
(IJ in the Khasáïs:) Suh, in the R, asserts that
آنَ is formed by transposition from أَنَى: (TA:)
the assertion of El-Bekree, that آنَ is originally
with و [for its medial radical letter], and that it is
of the class of وَلِىَ, aor. يَلِى, requires consideration, and involves what is contrary to rule. (MF.)
You say also, آنَ أَيْنُكَ, (S, M, K,) and إِينُكَ, (M,
K,) and آنُكَ, (S, K,) i. e. حَانَ حِينُكَ [Thy time,
or season, came, or hath come: or drew near, or
hath drawn near]. (S, M, K.)
آنٌ: see أَيْنٌ. ―
-b2-  الْآنَ is a noun denoting the
present time; (S, M, Msb, K;) [signifying At
the present time; now; for] it is an adverbial
noun; (S, Msb, K;) one which, in a place where
it is fitting to be used as such, may not be used
otherwise; occurring in a determinate sense; (S,
K;) the ال being inseparable from it; (IJ, M,
Msb;) not prefixed to it for the purpose of rendering it determinate, because it has not that
which participates in its meaning: (S, Msb, K:)
as Ibn-Es-Sarráj says, there is not one آن and
another آن: (Msb:) [accord. to ISd, who quotes
a long disquisition by IJ on this word,] the ال
which is expressed in this case is redundant,
because the noun is determinate without it, but it
is rendered so by another ال, which is understood,
as in the case of أَمْسِ: so says IJ, following
Aboo-'Alee; and his is the correct opinion: (M:)
Fr says that it is a particle, compounded with ال,
which is inseparable from it; and that it is
originally أَوَانَ [or الْأَوَانَ]: or that it may have
originated from the phrase آنَ لَكَ أَنْ تَفْعَلَ [explained above], and is therefore mansoob, like
قِيلَ and قَالَ when used as nouns: but Zj disallows
its originating from آنَ; and says that the right
opinion is that of Kh, that الْآنَ is indecl. with
fet-h for its termination, and that the ال is prefixed because the meaning is هٰذَا الوَقْت; and
this is the opinion of Sb. (T.) You say, أَنَا الْآنَ
أَفْعَلُ كَذَا [I, at the present time, or now, do,
or will do, thus, or such a thing]. (M.) And
كُنْتُ الْآنَ عِنْدَهُ, meaning I was, in this time, of
which part is present and some portions have
passed, with him, or in his presence. (IJ, M.)
And when you mean the kind of expression
which is used in this saying, you say, اَلْآنُ حَدُّ
الزَّمَانَيْنِ [The term “ now ” is the limit of the two
times; namely the past and the future]; thus
pronounced, marfooa: so says IJ: but in the
Book of Sb we read, الآنَ حَدُّ الزَّمَانَيْنِ, with
nasb: and in like manner, in the same, الآنَ آنُكَ
[Now is thy time]; the former with nasb and the
latter with refa. (M.) You say also, هٰذَا أَوَانُ
الْآنَ [This is the present time]: and مَا جِئْتُ إِلَّا
أَوَانَ الْآنَ, meaning I came not save at the present
time, or now: with the last word mansoob in both
instances. (ISh, T.) [And إِلَى الْآنَ and حَتَّى الْآنَ
To the present time and until the present time;
i. e. hitherto. And مِنَ الْآنَ From the present
time; henceforward.] Sometimes the hemzeh
[after the ل] is suppressed, and its vowel is transferred to the ل; so that you say الَانَ. (Bd ii. 66.)
And sometimes also the ل is pronounced with
fet-h and both the hemzehs are suppressed; so
that you say لَانَ. (S, K.) And sometimes تَ
is prefixed to it, like as it is to حِينَ; so that you
say تَلَانَ, like as you say تَحِينَ. (El-Umawee,
A 'Obeyd. [See art. تلن.])
أَيْنٌ Fatigue. (S, K, &c.) [Whether it be a
simple subst., or an inf. n., and, if the latter,
whether it be an inf. n. of آنَ only in the former
of the two senses assigned to that verb above, or
in both these senses, is doubted: see 1, throughout.]
-A2-  A time; a season; syn. حِينٌ; (S, M,
K;) as also ↓ إِينٌ (M, K) and ↓ آنٌ. (S, K.)
[See 1, last sentence.]
أَيْنَ is an adverbial noun, (Msb,) an interrogative respecting a place: (S, M, Msb, K:) [signifying Where? in what place?]: Zj says that it
is an interrogative particle, like كَيْفَ: (T:) [ISd
says,] it is a noun, because you say, مِنْ أَيْنَ
[meaning From what place? whence?]: (M:)
[and you say also, إِلَى أَيْنَ To what place?
whither?]: it is always mansoob, unless you
prefix the article to it, saying الأَيْنُ [which means
The place where]: (Lth, T:) it is fem.; but may
be made masc. (Lh, M.) You say, أَيْنَ زَيْدٌ
Where, or in what place, is Zeyd? (S, Msb.)
And أَيْنَ بَيْتُكَ [Where is thy house, or tent?].
(M.) And أَيْنَ يُذْهَبُ بِكَ, which may mean
Where, or whither, wilt thou be taken away, and
what will be done with thee and made to come to
pass with thee, if this be thine intellect? or,
accord. to Mtr, it is a saying of the people of
Baghdád, addressed to him whom they charge
with foolish judgment or opinion, as meaning
أَيْنَ يُذْهَبُ بِعَقْلِكَ [Where, or whither, is thine
intellect taken away?]. (Har p. 574.) [And
أَيْنَ هٰذَا مِنْ ذَاكَ and عَنْ ذَاكَ and وَ ذَاكَ What
place does this hold in relation to that, or in comparison with that? what is this in relation to
that, or in comparison with that? what has this
to do with that? what has this in common with
that?] ―
-b2-  It also denotes a condition: when you
say, أَيْنَ تَجْلِسْ أَجْلِسْ [Where thou sittest, I will
sit], the sitting must be in one place: and مَا is
added to it; so that you say, أَيْنَمَا تَقُمْ أَقُمْ [Wherever thou standest, I will stand]. (Msb.) ―
-b3-  It
also occurs used as a proper name of a particular
place: thus the poet Homeyd Ibn-Thowr speaks
of his companions as being بِأَيْنَ وَ أَيْنَمَا [app.
meaning In certain places: where and wherever
those places were, there were my companions]: in
which case it is divested of the meaning of an
interrogative, and is imperfectly decl. because
determinate and of the fem. gender. (M, L. [In
one copy of the former, بِأَنَّى وَ أَيْنَمَا, which may
mean the same; and voce أَىٌّ, q. v., بِأَىَّ وَ أَيْنَمَا.])
إِينٌ: see أَيْنٌ.
أَيَّانَ, (T, S, M, &c.,) of the measure فَعَّال, or
it may be of the measure فَعْلَان, (Msb,) also pronounced ↓ إِيَّانَ, (T, S, M, K,) the latter of the
dial. of Suleym, mentioned by Fr, (T, S,) and by
Zj, (M,) is an interrogative respecting a time, (T,
S, Msb,) but only respecting a time not come:
(T:) signifying When? (S, M, Msb;) at what
time? (Msb, K:) it is fem.; but may be made
masc.: (Lh, M:) and it may be pronounced with
imáleh, though not belonging to a class of words
regularly subject to imáleh. (TA.) It is said in
the Kur [xvi. 22 and xxvii. 67], accord. to different readings, أَيَّانَ يُبْعَثُونَ or ↓ إِيَّانِ [When they
shall be raised to life]; (T, S, M;) i. e. when
shall be the resurrection. (Aboo-Is-hák, T.) But
you may not say, أَيَّانَ فَعَلْتَ ذَاكَ as meaning
When didst thou that? (T.) ―
-b2-  IJ says that,
were it syn. with مَتَى, it would be conditional;
whereas it was not mentioned by his colleagues
among the adverbs used conditionally, as مَتَى and
أَيْنَ &c.: but sometimes it has a conditional
meaning, though that meaning be not explicit.
(M.) A poet says,
أَيَّانَ نُؤْمِنْكَ تَأْمَنْ غَيْرَنَا وَ إِذَا
لَمْ تُدْرِكِ الأَمْنَ مِنَّا لَمْ تَزَلْ حَذِرَا
[When we grant thee security, thou wilt be secure
from others than us; and when thou obtainest
not security from us, thou wilt not cease to be in
a state of fear]. (I 'Ak p. 300.)
إِيَّانَ: see أَيَّانَ, in two places.
آئِنٌ part. n. of آنَ in both its senses.
آيِنَةٌ: see أَوَانٌ.
