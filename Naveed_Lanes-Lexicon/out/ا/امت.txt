امت1
أَمَتَهُ, (T, S, M, K,) aor.
اَمِتَ, (T, M, K,) inf. N.
أَمْتٌ, (T, S, M,) He measured it; determined its
measure, quantity, or the like; computed, or conjectured, its measure, quantity, &c.; (T, S, * M,
K;) as also ↓ امّتهُ, (M, K,) inf. n. تَأْمِيتٌ. (TA.)
You say, اِيمِتْ يَا فُلَانُ هٰذَا لِى كَمْ هُوَ Compute
thou, O such a one, this, for me, how many it is.
(T.) And أَمَتَ القَوْمَ He computer, or conjectured,
the number of the people, or company of men.
(T.) And أَمَتَ المَآءَ He measured, or computed,
the distance between him and the water. (T.) ―
-b2-
Also, (S, K,) aor. as above, (K,) and so the
inf. n., (S,) i. q. قَصَدَهُ [He tended, repaired,
betook himself, or directed his course, to it, or

أمّتهُ: see 1. ―
-b2-  أُمِّتَ بِلشَّرِّ He was suspected
of evil. (M, TA.)
أَمْتٌA measure of distance [&c.]; as in the
saying, كَمْ أَمْتُ بَيْنَكَ مَا بَيْنَ الكُوفَةِ What is
the measure of the distance between thee and
El-Koofeh? (T, TA.)
-A2-  Doubt: (Th, T, M:)
said to be so termed because this word signifies
the “ computing, or conjecturing, measure, quantity, and the like,” in which there is doubt. (T,
TA.) [See 1.] So in the following ex.: الخَمْرُ
حَرُمَتْ لَا أَمْتَ فِيهَا Wine is unlawful: there is no
doubt respecting the unlawfulness of it: (Sh, Th,
T, K:) or the meaning is, there is no indulgence, or
lenity, with respect to it; from أَمْتٌ as signifying
“feebleness, or weakness,” in a journey, or pace.
(T, TA.) And in the saying, لَيْسَ فى الخَمْرِ أَمْتٌ
There is no doubt respecting wine, that it is
unlawful. (Th, M.) [Or in the like of these
two instances it signifies] Disagreement, or diversity of opinion, (اِخْتِلَافٌ,) respecting a thing
(فِى شَىْءٍ). (M, K.)
-A3-  Curvity, crookedness,
distortion, or unevenness: (M, K:) ruggedness
in one place and smoothness in another; (K;)
[inequality of surface;] one part being higher,
or more prominent, than another: (TA:) an
elevated place: (T, S, K:) small mounds: (Fr,
Th, T, S, M, K:) or what is elevated, of ground:
or, as some say, water-courses of valleys, such
as are low, or depressed: (Fr, T, TA:) small
hills; hillocks: (M, TA:) a hollow, or depressed
place, between any two elevated portions of ground
&c.: (IAar, T, M:) depression and elevation,
or lowness and highness, (S, M, A, K,) in the
ground; (A;) used in this sense in the Kur
xx. 106; (S;) and the same in a water-skin not
completely filled: (S, A: *) or laxity in a water-skin when it is not well filled so as to overflow:
(T, * TA:) or a [consequence of] pouring [water]
into a skin until it doubles, or creases, and not
filling it; so that one part of it is higher, or
more prominent, than another: (M, TA:) pl.
إِمَاتٌ (M, K, TA, but in some copies of the K
آمَاتٌ, and in the CK اَماتٌ,) and أُمُوتٌ. (M, K.)
You say, اسْتَوَتِ الأَرْضُ فَمَا بَهَا أَمْتٌ The earth,
or ground, was even, so that there was not in
it any depression and elevation. (A, TA.) And
اِمْتَلَأَ السِّقَآءُ فَمَا بِهِ أَمْتٌ The skin became full,
so that there was not in it any depression  [of one
part of its surface] and elevation [of another
part]. (S, A. *) Az says, (TA,) I have heard
the Arabs say, قَدْ مَلَأَ القِرْبَةَ مَلْأً لَا أَمْتَ فِيهِ He
had filled the water-skin so full that there was no
laxity in it. (T, TA.) ―
-b2-  A fault, a defect, an
imperfection, a blemish, or the like, (T, M, K,)
in the mouth, and in a garment, or piece of cloth,
and in a stone. (M, K.) [Hence the saying,]
أَمْتٌ فِى الحَجَرِ لَا فِيكَ i. e. [May there be a
defect, or the like,] in stones; not in thee: meaning, may God preserve thee when the stones shall
have perished: (Sb, M:) امت is here put in the
nom. case, though the phrase is significant of
a prayer, because it is not a verbal word: the
phrase is like التُّرابُ لَهْ: and the commencing
the sentence with an indeterminate noun is approvable because it is virtually a prayer. (M.)
This prov. is mentioned by the expositors of the
Tes-heel: not by Meyd. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Weakness;
feebleness; (T, K;) langour; remissness. (TA.)
You say, سِرْنَا سَيْرًا لَا أَمْتَ فِيهِ We performed a
journey, or went a pace, in which was no weakness, or feebleness [&c.]. (T, TA.)
-A4-  A good
way, course, mode, or manner, of acting, or
conduct, or the like. (T, K.)
مُؤَمَّتٌ Suspected of evil and the like. (K.)
[See 2.]
-A2-  [A water-skin] filled [so as to be
equally distended: see أَمْتٌ]. (K.)
مَآْءٌ مَأْمُوتٌ A water of which the distance is
computed, or conjectured. (TA.) ―
-b2-  هُوَ إِلَى أَجَلٍ
مَاْمُوتٍ It is until a determined, defined, or
definite, period. (S, K. *) ―
-b3-  شَىْءٌ مَأْمُوتٌ A thing
that is known. (M, TA.) [And so مَوْمُوتٌ.]
