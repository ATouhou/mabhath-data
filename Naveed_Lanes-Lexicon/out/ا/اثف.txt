اثف1
أَثَفَ القِدْرَ: see 2.
-A2-  أَثَفَهُ, aor.
اَثِفَ, (T, S, M,
K,) inf. n. أَثْفٌ, (T, M,) He followed him. (Ks,
T, S, M, K.) ―
-b2-  He drove away, or drove away
and pursued closely, or hunted, him; syn. طَرَدَهُ.
(Ibn-'Abbád, K.) ―
-b3-  He sought, or sought after,
or pursued after, him, or it: in which sense the
aor. is اثّف القِدٌرَ, (AA, K) and تَأْثِيفٌalso. (So in some copies
of the K.)

اثّف القِدْرَ, (T, S, M, K,) inf. n. تَأْثِيفٌ, (S, K,)
He put the cooking-pot upon the أَثَافِى[pl. of
أُثْفِيَّةٌ, q. v.]; (T,* S, M,* K;) as also ↓ أَثَفَهَا,
(M, TA,) inf. n. أَثْفٌ; (TA;) or ↓ آثَفَهَا, (so in
some copies of the K in art. ثفى,) inf. n. إِيثَافٌ;
(TA in that art.;) the first of which is a dial. var.
of ثَفَّاهَا, inf. n. تَثْفِيَةٌ; (S;) and ↓ أَثْفَاهَا, whence
قِدْرٌ مُؤَثْفَاةٌ. (M.)

آثَفَ see 2.

تَأَثًّفَتِ القِدْرُThe cooking-pot was put upon
the أَثَافِى. (TA.)
-A2-  تَأَثَّفُوهُThey surrounded him,
or it: (S, K: *) they became around him, or it,
like the أُثْفِيَّة[or rather like the أَثَافِى]: (M:)
they collected themselves together around him, or
it. (A, TA.) ―
-b2- تأثّف المَكَانَ, (T, S, K,) or بِالمَكَانِ,
(M,) He (a man, S) kept to the place; (T, K;)
remained in it; (M;) did not quit it. (AZ, T,
S, M.) ―
-b3-  تأثّفهُalso signifies He followed after
him, and pressed or importuned him, and ceased
not to incite him. (T, K.) In my opinion, [says
Az,] this is not in any way derived from الأُثْفِيَّةُ;
but from أَثَفْتُ الرَّجُلَ, meaning “ I followed the
man.” (T.) ―
-b4-  And تأثّفوا عَلَى الأَمْرِThey aided,
or assisted, one another to do, or accomplish, the
thing, or affair. (M, L.)
Q. Q. 1
أَثْفَى القِدْرَ: see 2. [But accord. to
Az, in the T, يُؤَثْفِى, as aor. of أَثْفَى, is يُثْفِىreduced to its original form; and the like is said in
the S and M in art. ثفى. If this be the case,
مُؤَثْفَاةٌ, q. v., may be مُثْفَاةٌreduced in the same
manner, i. e., to its original form.]
أَثِفٌ[probably a mistake for ↓آثِفٌ] Continuing,
permanent, constant, firm, or established: (K,
TA:) so in the Moheet. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also, (K, and
so in a copy of the S,) or ↓ آثِفٌ, [agreeably with
analogy, and therefore more probably the correct
form,] (so in other copies of the S and in the T,)
Following. (Ks, T, S, K.)
أُثْفِيَّةٌand إِثْفِيَّةٌ[the former of which is the more
common, and this only I find in copies of the T,]
The stone [which is one of the three] whereon the
cooking-pot is placed: (A'Obeyd, M, K:) it is,
with the Arabs, a stone like the head of a man: (T:)
the pl. is أَثَافِيُّand أَثَافٍ; (T, S, [in which latter
it is written differently in different copies, with
the article prefixed, الأَثَافِيُّand الأَثَافِي, but in
both manners in art. ثفى,] M, K;) the latter
being allowable; (T,) or, accord. to Akh, the
latter only is used by the Arabs; (M;) applied
to the three stones mentioned above: (TA in art.
سفع; &c.:) upon these the cooking-pot is set up;
but what is of iron, having three legs, is not
called اثفيّة, but مِنْصَبٌ; (T;) [and this is what
is meant by أَثْفِيَّةٌ مِنْ حَدِيدٍin art. سفعin the K;]
i. e. an iron trivet upon which a cooking-pot is
set up. (TA in art. نصب.) أُثْفيَّةٌmay be of the
measure فُعْلُويَةٌ[from اثف], and it may be of
the measure أُفْعُولَةٌ[from ثفى; in either case
originally أُثْفُويَةٌ]. (A, L.) ثَالِثَةُ الأَثَافِىsignifies
The part, not detached, of a mountain; by the
side of which, two pieces are put [for the cookingpot to be set thereon]. (A'Obeyd, T, K.) And
hence the saying, (A'Obeyd, T,) رَمَاهُ اللّٰهُ بثَالِثَةِ,
الأَثَافِي(A'Obeyd, T, K) May God smite him
with the mountain; meaning, with a calamity;
(Th, TA, K in art. ثفى;) with a calamity like the
mountain [in greatness]; (Th, M;) for when they
do not find the third of the اثافى, they rest the
cooking-pot [partly] upon the mountain: (M, K,
in art. ثفى:) or, with difficulties, or troubles, or
calamities: (As, T:) or, with all evil; evils being
likened to one اثفيّةafter another, and the third
being the last: (T, K:) so says Aboo-Sa'eed:
(T:) or, with the last of evil; and the last of
everything hateful: (AO in Har p. 84:) or,
with a great calamity. (Har ib.) One says also,
الأَثَافِى فُلَانٌ ثَالِثَةُ, meaning (tropical:)  Such a one is the
heaviest, most burdensome, or most troublesome, of
the people. (Har ubi suprà.) ―
-b2-  [Hence also,]
الأَثَافِىis a name applied to (assumed tropical:)  certain stars [accord.
to Ideler, as mentioned by Freytag in his Lex.,
the stars σand τand υDraconis] over against
the head of the قِدْر; which is the name of certain
stars disposed in a round form. (AHát, K.)
[Also] a name given by the vulgar to (assumed tropical:)  [The three
chief stars in the constellation called] الشَّلْيَاقُ[i. e.
Lyra]. (Kzw.) ―
-b3-  The sing., (K,) i. e. each of
the two forms thereof, but written in the copies of
the S with damm [only], (TA in art. ثفى,) or
[only] the latter, with kesr, (M, and so in the K
in art. ثفى,) also signifies (assumed tropical:)  A number, (M,) or
a great number, (K, and so in the S in art. ثفى,)
and a company, or congregated body, of men:
(M, K:) pl. as above. (M.) You say, هُمْ عَلَيْهِ
أُثْفِيَّةٌ وَاحِدَةٌ(assumed tropical:)  [They are against him one band].
(TA.) And بَقِيَتْ مِنْ بَنِى فُلَانٍ أُثْفِيَّةٌ خَشْنَآءُ
There remained of the sons of such a one a great
number. (S in art. ثفى.)
آثفٌ: see أَثفٌ, in two places.
مُؤَثَّفٌ(assumed tropical:)  Short, broad, plump, and fleshy. (K.)
―
-b2-  And, with ة, (tropical:)  A woman whose husband has
two wives beside her; she being the third of them:
they being likened to the أَثَافِىof the cookingpot. (M.) [See also مُثَفَّاةٌ, in art. ثفى.)
قِدْرٌ مُؤَثْفَاةٌA cooking-pot put upon the أَثَافِى
[pl. of أُثْفِيَّةٌ, q. v.]. (M, and K in art. ثفى: in
some copies of the latter, مؤْثَفَاةٌ.) [See Q. Q. 1.]
