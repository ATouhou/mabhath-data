ايلإِيلُ a name of God; (Lth, T, S, M, K;) a
Hebrew word; (Lth, S;) or Syriac: (S:) it is a
dial. var. of إِلُّ [q. v.]: or the latter may be
an arabicized form of the former: (Az, TA:)
Ibn-El-Kelbee says that جَبْرَئِيلُ and مِيكَائِيلُ and
the like are similar to عَبْدُ اللّٰهِ and عَبْدَ الرَّحْمَانِ;
(M;) [and J says,] they are like عَبْدُ اللّٰهِ and
تَيْمُ اللّٰهِ: (S:) so that جَبْر signifies “ servant,”
and is prefixed to ايل, governing it in the gen.
case: (M:) but this is not a valid assertion; for
were it so, such names would be perfectly decl.:
(M in art. ال:) Suh says, in the R, that جِبرئيل
is Syriac, and means عَبْدُ الرَّحْمَانِ, or عَبْدُ العزِيزِ,
as is related on the anthority of I'Ab: that most
persons hold ايل in this case to be a name of
God: but that some hold names of this kind
to be constructed inversely, after the manner of
the language of the 'Ajam; ايل meaning servant.
