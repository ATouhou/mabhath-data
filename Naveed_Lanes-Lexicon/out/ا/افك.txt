افك1
أَفَكَهُ, aor.
اَفِكَ, inf. n. أَفْكٌ, (with fet-h, S, TA,
its only form, TA, [in the CK اِفْك,]) He changed
his, or its, manner of being, or state; (S, K;) and
he turned him, or it, (i. e., anything, Msb,)
away, or back; (S, Msb, K;) عَنِ الشَّىْءِ [from
the thing]; (S;) or عَنْ وَجْهِهِ [from his, or its,
mode, or manner, of being, &c.]: (Msb:) so in
the Kur xlvi. 21, أَجِئْتَنَا لِتَأْفِكَنَا عَنْ آلِهَتِنَا Hast
thou come to us to turn us away, or back, from
our gods? (Bd:) or he turned him away, or
back, by lying: (TA:) or he changed, or perverted, his judgment, or opinion: (K:) or he
deceived him, or beguiled him, and so turned him
away, or back: and simply he deceived him, or
beguiled him: and أُفِكَ signifies he was turned
from his judgment, or opinion, by deceit, or guile.
(TA.) It is said in the Kur [li. 9], يُؤْفَكُ عَنْهُ مَنْ
أُفِكَ, i. e., He will be turned away from it
(namely, the truth,) who is turned away in the
foreknowledge of God: (TA:) or, accord. to
Mujáhid, يُؤْفَنُ عَنْهُ مَنْ أُفِنَ [he will be weak in
intellect and judgment so as to be thereby turned
away from it who is weak in intellect and judgment]. (S, TA.) You say also, أُفِكَ الرَّجُلُ عَنِ
الخَيْرِ The man was turned away, or back, from
good, or prosperity. (Sh.) And أَفَكَهُ, (K, TA,)
inf. n. as above, (TA,) He forbade him what he
wished, (K, TA,) and turned him away, or back,
from it. (TA.) ―

He, or it, made such a one to lie, or say what
was untrue. (K.) ―
-b5-  أُفِكَ He was weak [as
