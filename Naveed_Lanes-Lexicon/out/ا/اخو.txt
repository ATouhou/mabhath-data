اخو1
أَخَوْتَ, [third pers. أَخَا,] (S, K,) aor. تَأْخُو,
(S,) inf. n. أُخُوَّةٌ; (S, K, &c.;) and ↓ آخَيْتَ, (K,
TA,) [in the CK اَخَيْتُ, which is wrong in
respect of the pers., and otherwise, for it is correctly] with medd, (TA,) inf. n. إِخَآءٌ and مُؤَاخَاةٌ;
(Lth;) and ↓ تَأَخَّيْتَ; (K;) Thou becamest a
brother [in the proper sense of this word, and also
as meaning a friend, or companion, or the like].
(S,* K,* TA.) ↓أُخُوَّةٌ is also [used as] a simple
subst., (TA,) signifying Brotherhood; fraternity;
the relation of brother; as also ↓إِخَآءٌ and مُؤَاخاةٌ;
and ↓تَأَخٍ: (Lth, TA:) and the relation of sister.
(S.) You say, بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَهُ أُخُوَّةٌ and ↓إِخَآءٌ [&c.,
meaning] Between me and him is brotherhood.
(JK, TA.) And ↓بَيْنَ السَّمَاحَةِ وَالحَمَاسَةِ تَأَخٍ (assumed tropical:) [Between liberality and courage is a relation like that
of brothers]. (TA.) And خُوَّةٌ is a dial. var. of
أُخُوَّةٌ, occurring in a trad. (IAth, TA.)
-A2-  [It is
also trans.] You say, أَخَوْتُ عَشَرَةً I was, or became, a brother to ten. (TA.)
2
أَخَّيْتُ لِلدَّابَّةِ, (S, K,) or الدَّابَّةَ, (Msb, [so
accord. to a copy of that work, but probably this
is a mistranscription,]) inf. n. تَأْخِيَةٌ, (S, Msb,
K,) I made an آخِيَّة [q. v.] for the beast, (Msb,
K,) and tied the beast therewith; (Msb;) [and
so, app., ↓ آخَيْتُ (which, if correct, is probably
of the measure أَفْعَلْتُ); for it is related that] an
Arab of the desert said to another, لِى آخِيَّةً ↓ آخِ
أَرْبِطُ إَلَيْهَا مُهْرِى [Make thou for me an آخيّة to
which I shall tie my colt]. (TA.) And you say,
فُلَانٌ فِى فُلَانٍ آخِيَّةً فَكَفَرَهَا ↓ آخِى (assumed tropical:)  Such a one
did a benefit to such a one, and he was ungrateful
for it. (TA.) [But perhaps آخِ and آخَى in
these two exs. are mistranscriptions for أَخِّ and
أَخَّى.]
3
آخاهُ, (S, K,) vulgarly وَاخَاهُ, (S,) or the
latter is a dial. var. of weak authority, (K,* TA,)
said by some to be of the dial. of Teiyi, (TA,)
inf. n. مُؤَاخَاةٌ and إِخآءٌ (S, K) and وِخَآءٌ, (K) and
[quasi-inf. n.] ↓ إِخَاوَةٌ (Fr, K) and وِخَاوَةٌ, (CK,)
He fraternized with him; acted with him in a
brotherly manner: (S,* K,* PS, TK:) A'Obeyd
mentions, on the authority of Yz, آخَيْتُ and
وَاخَيْتُ, and آسَيْتُ and وَاسَيْتُ, and آكَلْتُ and
وَاكَلْتُ: the pret. is said to be thus assimilated
to [a form of] the fut.; for they used [sometimes]
to say, يُوَاخِى, changing the hemzeh into و. (IB,
TA.) ―
-b2-  It is said in a trad., آخَى بَيْنَ المُهَاجِرِينَ
وَالأَنْصَارِ, meaning He united the emigrants [to
El-Medeeneh] with the assistants [previously dwel-ling there] by the brotherhood of El-Islám and
of the faith. (TA.) You say also, آخَيْتُ بَيْنَ
الشَّيْئَنْنِ [I united the two things as fellows, or
pairs]; and sometimes one says, وَاخَيْتُ, like as
one says, وَاسَيْتُ, for آسَيْتُ; mentioned by ISk.
(Msb.) ―

آخَوَ see 2, in three places.
5
تَأَخَّيْتَ, and the inf.n. تَأَخٍ: see 1, in three places.
-A2-  تَأَخَّيْتُ أَخًا I adopted a brother: (S, K:) or
[تَأَخَّيْتُهُ signifies] I called him brother. (K.) ―
-b2-
تَأَخَّيْتُ الشَّىْءَ, (S, K, TA,) or بِالشَّىْ, (Msb,) I
sought, endeavoured after, pursued, or endeavoured
to reach or attain or obtain, the thing; (S, Msb,
K, TA;) as the brother does the brother; and in
the same manner the verb is used with a man for
its object: but تَوَخَّيْتُ, in the same sense, is more
common. (TA.) You say, تَأَخَّيْتُ مَحَبَّتَكَ I
sought, &c., thy love, or affection. (TA in art.
وخى.)
6
تَآخَيَا They became brothers, or friends or
companions or the like, to each other. (S,* TA.)
أَخٌ, (S, Msb, K,) originally أَخَوٌ, (Kh, S, Msb,)
as is shown by the first of its dual forms mentioned below, and by its having a pl. like آبَآءٍ,
(S,) and أَخٌّ, (K,) with the second letter doubled to
compensate for the و suppressed, as is the case in
أَبٌّ, (TA,) and ↓ أَخًا, [like أَبًا,] and ↓ أَخُو, (IAar,
K, TA, [the last, with the article prefixed to it,
erroneously written in the CK الاُخُوٌّ,]) and ↓ أَخْوٌ,
like دَلْوٌ, (Kr, K,) a well-known term of relationship, (K, TA,) i. e. A brother; the son of one's
father and mother, or of either of them: and also
applied to a foster-brother: (TA:) and (assumed tropical:) a friend;
and a companion, an associate, or a fellow: (K:)
derived from آخِيَّةٌ [q. v.]; as though one أَخ were
tied and attached to another like as the horse is
tied to the آخيّة: (Har p. 42 :) or, accord. to
some of the grammarians, it is from وَخَى meaning
قَصَدَ; because the أَخ has the same aim, endeavour,
or desire, as his أَخ: (TA:) when أَخ is prefixed
to another noun, its final vowel is prolonged:
(Kh:) you say, هذَا أَخُوكَ [This is thy brother,
&c.], and مَرَرْتُ بِأَخِيكَ [I passed by thy brother,
&c.], and رَأَيْتُ أَخَاكَ [I saw thy brother, &c.] :
(S: [in which it is also asserted that one does not
say أَخُو without prefixing it to another noun;
but this is inconsistent with the assertion of IAar
and F, that الأَخُو is a syn. of الأَخُ:]) the dual is
أَخَوَانِ, (S, Msb, Kur xlix. 10, Ham p. 434,) or
أَخْوَانِ, with the خ quiescent, (TA, [but this I
have found nowhere else,]) and some of the Arabs
say أَخَانِ, (S, Msb,) and Kr mentions أَخُوَانِ,
with damm to the خ, said by IB to occur in
poetry, and held by ISd to be dual of أَخُو, with
damm to the خ: (TA:) the pl. is إِخْوَةٌ and إِخْوَانٌ,
(S, Msb, K, &c.,) the former generally applied
to brothers, and the latter to friends [or the like],
(T, S,*) but not always, as in the Kur xlix. 10,
where the former does not denote relationship,
and in xxiv. 60 of the same, where the latter does
denote relationship, (T, TA,) and sometimes the
former is applied to a [single] man, as in the
Kur iv. 12, (S,) and أُخْوَةٌ, (Fr, S, Msb, K, [in
the CK اَخْوَةٌ,]) or this is a quasi-pl. n., (Sb, TA,)
and أُخْوَانٌ, (Kr, Msb, K,) and آخَآءٌ, (S, K,) like
آبَآءٌ, (S,) and أُخُوٌّ, and أُخُوَّةٌ, (ISd, K,) the last
mentioned by Lh, and thought by ISd to be
formed from the next preceding by the addition
of ة characterizing the pl. as fem., (TA,) and
أَخُونَ, (S, Msb, K,) and اخاوون. (Msb: [there
written without any syll. signs, and I have not
found it elsewhere.]) The fem. of أَخٌ is ↓ أُخْتٌ
[meaning A sister: and (assumed tropical:)  a female friend, &c.]:
(S, Msb, K, &c. :) written with damm to show
that the letter which has gone from it is و; (S;)
the ت being a substitute for the و; (TA;) not to
denote the fem. gender, (K, TA,) because the
letter next before it is quiescent: this is the
opinion of Sb, and [accord. to SM] it is the correct opinion: for Sb says that if you were to use
it as a proper name of a man, you would make it
perfectly decl.; and if the ت were to denote the
fem. gender, the name would not be perfectly
decl.; though in one place he incidentally says
that it is the sign of the fem. gender, through
inadvertence: Kh, however, says that its ت is
[originally] ه [meaning ة]: and Lth, that أُخْتٌ
is originally أَخَةٌ: and some say that it is originally أَخْوَةٌ: (TA:) the dual. is أُخْتَانِ: (Kh:)
and the pl. is أَخَوَاتٌ. (Kh, S, Msb, K.) The
saying لَا أَخَالَكَ بِفُلَانٍ [Thou hast no brother, or
(assumed tropical:) friend, in such a one] means لَيْسَ لَكَ بِأَخٍ [such a
one is not a brother, or friend, to thee]. (S, K.)
It is said in a prov., مَنْ لَكَ بِأَخِيكَ كُلِّهِ [Who
will be responsible to thee for thy brother, or (assumed tropical:)  thy
friend, altogether? i. e., for his always acting to
thee as a brother, or friend]. (JK.) And in
another, رُبَّ أَخٍ لَكَ لَمْ تَلِدْهُ أُمُّكَ [(assumed tropical:)  There is many
a brother to thee whom thy mother has not brought
forth]. (TA.) And in another, أَخُوكَ أَمِ الذَّئْبُ
[Is it thy brother, or the wolf?]; said in suspecting a thing: as also أَخُوكَ أَمِ اللَّيْلُ [Is it thy
brother, or is it the night that deceives thee?].
(Har p. 554.) And another saying is, الرُّمْحُ أَخُوكَ
وَرُبَّمَا خَانَكَ [(assumed tropical:) The spear is thy brother, but sometimes, or often, it is unfaithful to thee]. (TA.)
―
-b2-  Ibn-'Arafeh says that when أُخُوَّةٌ does not
relate to birth, it means conformity, or similarity;
and combination, agreement, or unison, in action:
hence the saying, هذَا الثَّوْبُ أَخُو هذَا [(assumed tropical:) This
garment, or piece of cloth, is the like, or fellow,
of this] : and hence the saying in the Kur [xvii.
29], كَانُوا إِخْوَانَ الشَّيَاطِينِ  (assumed tropical:)  They are the likes,
or fellows, of the devils: and in the same [xliii. 47],
↓ إِلَّا هِىَ أَكْبَرُ مِنْ أُخْتِهَا (assumed tropical:)  But it was greater than
its like, or fellow; i. e., than what was like to it
in truth &c. (TA.) It is said in a trad., النَّوْمُ
أَخُ المَوْتِ [Sleep is the like of death]. (El-Jámi'
es-Sagheer.) One says also, لَقِىَ فُلَانٌ أَخَا المَوْتِ
(assumed tropical:)  Such a one met with the like of death. (Msb,
TA.) And they said, لَهَا ↓ وَمَاهُ آللّٰهُ بِلَيْلَپٍ لَا أُخْتَ
[(assumed tropical:)  God afflicted him with a night having none like to
it], i. e., a night in which he should die. (TA.) And
لَا أُكَلِّمُهُ إِلَّا أَخَا السِّرارِ (assumed tropical:)  I will not speak to him
save the like of secret discourse. (As, TA.) [And
hence,] سُهَيْلٍ ↓ أُخْتَا [(assumed tropical:)  The two sisters of Canopus;]
the two stars called الشّعْرَى العَبُورُ and الشّعْرَى
الغُمَيْصَآءُ. (S and K in art. شعر, q. v.) ―
-b3-  يَاَ أَخَا بَكْرٍ,
or تَمِيمٍ, means (assumed tropical:)  O thou of [the tribe of] Bekr, or
Temeem. (Ham p. 284.) ―
-b4-  Lh mentions, on the
authority of Abu-d-Deenár and Ibn-Ziyád, the
saying, القُمْمُ بِأَخِى الشَّرَّ, as meaning (assumed tropical:)  The people,
or company of men, are in an evil state or condition. (TA.) [But accord. to others,] one says,
تَرَكْتُهُ بِأَخِى الخَيْرِ, meaning (tropical:)  I left him in an
evil state or condition: (JK, * Msb, K, TA:) and
بِأَخِى الشَّرِّ (tropical:)  in a good state or condition. (TA.)
―
-b5-  You say also, هُوَأَخُو الصَّدْقِ (assumed tropical:)  He is one who
cleaves, or keeps, to veracity. (Msb.) ―
-b6-  [أِخُو, as
a prefixed noun, is also used in the sense of أَهْلُ,
meaning (assumed tropical:)  Worthy, or deserving, of a thing: and
meet, fit, or fitted, for it. So in the phrase أَخُو ثِقَةٍ
(assumed tropical:)  Worthy, or deserving, of trust, or confidence;
expl. by W (p. 91) as meaning a person in whom
one trusts, or confides. And so in the prov.,
لَيْسَ أَخُو الكِظَاظِ مَنْ يَسْأَمُهُ (assumed tropical:)  He who is fit, or
fitted, for vehement striving for the mastery is
not he who turns away from it with disgust: see
art. كظ.] ―
-b7-  It is also used in the sense of ذُو:
as in the phrase, هُوَأَخُو الغِنَى [(assumed tropical:)  He is possessed,
or a possessor, of wealth, or competence, or sufficiency]. (Msb.) [So too in the phrase, أَخُو الخَيْرِ
(assumed tropical:)  Possessed, or a possessor, of good, or of what is
good. And in like manner,] أَخُو الخَنَعِ means
[ذُو الخَنَعِ, i. e. ذُو الذِّلَّةِ, i. e.] الّذَّلِيلُ [(assumed tropical:)  The low,
base, or abject]. (Ham p. 44.) [So too] سَيْرُنَا
أَخُو الجِيْدِ means [سَيْرُنَا ذُوالجَيْدِ, i. e.] سَيْرُنَا جَاهِدٌ
[(assumed tropical:)  Our journeying is laborious: see an ex. in the
first paragraph of art. غدر]. (TA.) ―
-b8-  حُمَّى
الأَخَوَيْنِ (assumed tropical:)  A fever that affects the patient two
days, and quits him two days; or that attacks on
Saturday, and quits for three days, and comes
[again] on Thursday; and so on. (Msb.) ―
-b9-
دَمُ الأَخَوَيْنِ: see دَمٌ, in art. دمى.
أَخًا:see أَخٌ.
أَخْوٌ:see أَخٌ.
أَخُو:see أَخٌ.
أُخْتٌ: see أَخٌ, in four places.
[
أُخَيٌّ and أُخَيَّةٌ dims. of أَخٌ and أُخْتٌ.]
أَخَوِيٌّ Brotherly; fraternal; of, or relating
to, a brother, and a friend or companion: and
also, sisterly; of, or relating to, a sister; because
you say أَخَوَاتٌ [meaning “sisters”]; but Yoo
used to say ↓ أُخْتِىُّ, which is not agreeable with
analogy. (S, TA.)
أُخْتِىُّ: see أَخَوِىُّ.
إِخْوَانٌ, besides being a pl. of أَخٌ, q. v., is a
dial. var. of خِوَانٌ. (TA. [See art. خون.])
إِخَاوَةٌ: see 3.
أُخُوَّهٌ an inf. n. of 1: and also [used as] a
simple subst. (TA.) See 1. ―
-b2-  When it does
not relate to birth, it means (assumed tropical:)  Conformity, or
similarity; and combination, agreement, or unison,
in action. (Ibn-'Arafeh, TA.)
آخِيَّةٌ, (Lth, S, Msb, K, &c.,) originally of the
measure فَاعُولَةٌ, [i. e. آخُويَةٌ,] (Msb,) and آخِيَةٌ,
(Lth, Msb, K,) and أَخِيَّةٌ, (JK, K, TA, [but in
the K the orthography of these three words is
differently expressed in different copies, and somewhat obscurely in all that I have seen,]) A piece
of rope of which the two ends are buried in the
ground, (ISk, JK, S,) with a small staff or stick,
or a small stone, attached thereto, (ISK, S,) a
portion thereof, resembling a loop, being apparent,
or exposed, to which the beast is tied; (ISk, JK,
S;) it is made in soft ground, as being more
commodious to horses than pegs, or stakes, protruding from the ground, and more firm in soft
ground than the peg, or stake: (TA:) or a loop
tied to a peg, or stake, driven [into the ground],
to which the beast is attached: (Msb:) or a
stick, or piece of wood, (K, TA,) placed crosswise
(TA) in a wall, or in a rope of which the two ends
are buried in the ground, the [other] end [or
portion] protruding, like a ring, to which the
beast is tied: (K, TA:) or a peg, or stake, to
which horses are tied: (Har p. 42:) [see also
آرِىُّ:] the pl. of the first is أَوَاخِىُّ; (JK, S, Msb,
K;*) and of the second, أوَاخٍ; (Msb;) and of
the third, أَخَايَا, (JK, K,*) like as خَطَايَا is pl.
of خَطِيَّةٌ. (TA.) In a trad., the believer and
belief are likened to a horse attached to his آخيّة;
because the horse wheels about, and then returns
to his آخيّة; and the believer is heedless, and then
returns to believe. (TA.) And in another, men
are forbidden to make their backs like the أَخَايَا
of beasts; i. e., in prayer; meaning that they
should not arch them therein, so as to make them
like the loops thus called. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also i. q.
طُنُبٌ; (K;) i. e. The kind of tent-rope thus
called. (TA in art. طنب, q. v.) ―
-b3-  And (assumed tropical:)  A
sacred, or an inviolable, right or the like; syn.
حُرْمَةٌ and ذِمَّةٌ. (S, K.) You say, لِفُلَانٍ أَوَاخِىُّ
وَأَسْبَابٌ تُرْعَى [(assumed tropical:)  To such a one belong sacred, or
inviolable, rights, and ties of relationship and love,
to be regarded]. (S.) And لَهُ عِنْدِى آجِيَّةٌ (assumed tropical:)  He
has, with me, or in my estimation, a strong,
sacred, or inviolable, right; and a near tie or
connexion, or means of access or intimacy or ingratiation. (TA.) ―
-b4-  In a trad. of 'Omar, in
which it is related that he said to El-'Abbás,
أَنْتَ آخِيَّةُ آبَآءِ رَسُولِ اَللّٰهِ, it is used in the sense of
بَقِيَّةَ; [and the words may therefore be rendered
Thou art the most excellent of the ancestors of
the Apostle of God;] as though he meant, thou
art he upon whom one stays himself, and to
whom one clings, of the stock of the Apostle of
God. (TA.)
