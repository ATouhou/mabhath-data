اد1
أَدَّتَّةُ دَاهِيَةٌ, aor
اَدُ3َ (T, S; M, K) and
اَدِ3َ, (M,
K,) but this latter is strange, [anomalous,] and
unknown, (TA,) and
اَدَ3َ, (M, K,) mentioned by
Lh, whence it seems that he made the pret. to
be of the measure فَعِلَ, or that it is co-ordinate to
أَبَى, aor يَأْبَى, (M,) inf. n. أَدُّ, (T, S, M,) A
calamity befell him. (M, K.) And in like manner, أَدَّهُ أَمْرٌ, aor. and inf. n. as above, An event
befell him: (M:) or oppressed him, distressed
him, or afflicted him. (Bd in xix. 91.)

wonderful thing: (M, L, K:) a very evil, abominable, severe, thing, or affair: (S, M, A, L, K:)
a calamity; (S, A, L, K,) or thus the former
word signifies; (M;) as also ↓ أَدُّ, (as in the
copies of the K,) or ↓ آدُّ, [originally آدِدً] of the
measure فَاعِلْ: (so in the S and L:) pl. (of إِدُّ
M, TA) إِدادُ (K, TA,) or أَدَادُ (T, CK, [but this,
if correct, is a quasi-pl. n.,]) or آدَادُ (M,) and (of
إِدَّةٌ, S, M) إِدَدٌ (T, S, M, K.) You say also
أَمْرْإِدُّ [meaning as above], using إِدُّ as an epithet,
accord. to Lh. (M.) And ↓ دَاهِيَةٌ إِدَّةٌ [A very
evil, abominable, or severe, calamity]. (A.) Hence
the saying in the Kur [xix. 91], لَقَدْ جِئْتُمْ شَيْئًا إِدًّا
Verily ye have done a very evil, or abominable,
thing: (S, M: *) or, accord. to one reading, ↓ أَدُّا;
both meaning great, or grievous: and some of the
Arabs say, ↓ بِشَىْءٍ آدٍّ, which means the same.
