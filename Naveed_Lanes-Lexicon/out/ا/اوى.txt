أَوَى إِلَيْهِ, (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) and أَوَاهُ,
(M, Msb, K,) aor. يَأْوِى, (T, S, Msb,) imperative
اِيوِ (T,) inf. n. أُوِىُّ, (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,)
with damm, (K,) of the measure فُعُولٌ, [originally
أُوُوىٌ,] (S,) and إِوِىٌّ, (Fr, M, K,) with kesr, (K,)
and إِوَآءٌ; (S;) and اليه ↓ أوّى, (M, K,) inf. n.
تَأْوِيَةٌ; (K;) and ↓ تأوّى; (M, K;) and ↓ اأْتَوَى,
(thus [more commonly ائتوى] accord. to a copy
of the M,) or ↓ اتَّوَى, (K,) like اتَّخَذَ, (TK,) and
↓ اِيتَوَى, (M, K,) both of the measure افتعل;
(TA;) and ↓ آوَى is used by some in the same
sense, but rejected, in this sense, by several;
(Msb;) the pronoun relating to a place of abode;
(T, S, M, Msb, K;) He betook himself to it, or
repaired to it, for lodging, covert, or refuge;
(Mgh;) and [simply] he got him or got himself,
betook himself, repaired, or resorted, to it; (T,
Mgh;) he returned to it; (M;) he took up his
abode in it; he lodged, or abode, or dwelt, in it.
(Msb, K.) Hence, in the Kur [xi. 45], سَآوِى إِلَى
جَبَلٍ يَعْصِمُنِى مِنَ المَآءِ [I will betake myself for
refuge to a mountain that shall preserve me from
the water]. (S.) الأُوِىُّ properly relates to living
beings; but is used otherwise, metaphorically.
(M.) In the saying of Lebeed,
بِصَبُوحِ صَافِيَةٍ وَجَذْبِ كَرِينَةٍ
لَهُ إِبْهَامُهَا ↓ بِمُوَترٍ تَأْتَى
[With a morning-potation of clear wine (خَمْرٍ
being understood), and a female singer's straining
of her chords, with a stringed instrument to which
her thumb returns after the straining], he means
تَأْتَوِى لَهُ, of the measure تَفْتَعِلُ, from أَوَيْتُ إِلَيْهِ
signifying عُدْتُ; the و being changed into ا
[written ى], and the ى, which is the final radical,
being elided. (M. [But see another reading near
the end of the first paragraph of art. اول.]) أَوَى,
aor. as above, inf. n. أُوِىٌ, also signifies He turned
away: and hence, [it is said,] إِذْ أَوَى الفِتْيَةُ إِلَى الكَهْفِ
[When the young men turned away to the cave:
though the verb may be here well rendered betook
themselves for refuge]. (Har p. 246.) You say
also, أَوَيْتُ إِلَى فُلَانٍ, (A'Obeyd, T,) or لَهُ, (as
afterwards written in a copy of the T,) [I betook
myself to such a one, or repaired to him, for
lodging, covert, or refuge; or] I joined myself,
got myself, betook myself, repaired, or resorted,
to such a one: and accord. to AHeyth, أَوَيْتُ
فُلَانًا signifies the same; but he did not know
أَوَيْتُ to be syn. with آوَيْتُ as explained below.
(T.) And أَوَى إِلَى اللّٰهِ He returned unto God.
(TA, from a trad.) ―
-b2-  أَوَى said of a wound: see
5.
-A2-  See also 4, in seven places.
-A3-  أَوَى لَهُ, (T,
S, M, Mgh, K,) like رَوَى, (K, TA,) but it would
have been more explicit if the author of the K
had said like رَمَى, (TA,) [as is shown by the false
reading in the CK, أوِىَ لَهُ كَرَوِىّ,] aor. يَأوِى,
(T, S, Mgh,) inf. n. أَوْيَةٌ (S, K) and إِيَّةٌ, (S, Mgh,
K,) with kesr, (TA,) [originally إِوْيَةٌ,] the و
being changed into ى because of the kesreh
before it, (S,) or because combined with ى and
preceded by sukoon [a mistake for “kesreh”],
(IB as cited in the TA,) [in a copy of the T
written ايَّة, and in a copy of the M and in the CK
اَيَّة,] and مَأْوِيَةٌ, (S, M, K,) without teshdeed, (S,
TA,) [in my copy of the Mgh written with tesh-deed,] and مَأْوَاهٌ, (S, M, K,) He compassionated
him; felt compassion, or pity, for him; (T, S,
M, Mgh, K;) as also ↓ ائتوى, (T, K,) of the
measure افتعل. (TA.) In using the imperative
form, you say, اِوِ لَهُ, [unless this be a mistranscription for اِيوِ لَهُ,] meaning Be thou compassionate to him. (T, TA.)

اَوَّىَ see 1, first sentence:
-A2-  and see 4.
-A3-  أَوَّيْتُ
بِالخَيْلِ (ISh, T) [I drew together the horses: this
meaning seems to be indicated in the T, by the
context: or] I called out to the horses آوَّهْ, in
order that they should return at hearing my
voice: (ISh:) and in like manner one says to
them ↓ آوِ or آوٍ; (ISh, T, TA;) a well-known
call of the Arabs to horses; and sometimes آى,
with a long meddeh, is said to them from afar.
(T, TA.) [See also 5.]
4
آواهُ, (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) inf. n. إيوَآءٌ;
(T, S, Mgh;) and ↓ أوّاهُ; (K;) and ↓ أَوَاهُ; (T,
S, M, Mgh, Msb, K;) the first of which is the
[most] approved; (T;) the last used by some;
(T, Msb;) both given on the authority of AZ,
(S,) and of A'Obeyd, accord. to whom you say,
أَوَيْتُ إِلَيْهِ, with the short ا only; (T, M;) He, or
it, gave him, or afforded him, lodging, covert, or
refuge; harboured him; sheltered him; protected
him; (Mgh;) he lodged him, or lodged him with
himself; made him his guest; or gave him refuge
or asylum, absolutely, or with himself; syn. أَنْزَلَهُ;
(K;) or أَنْزَلَهُ. (T, S, TA.) You say also,
الرَّجُلَ إِلَىَّ ↓ أَوَيْتُ and آوَيْتُهُ [I took the man to
me to lodge, to be my guest, or to give him refuge
or asylum]. (M.) And آوَاهُ سَقْفٌ [A roof shel-tered him]. (Mgh.) And الإِبِلَ ↓ أَوَيْتُ and آوَيْتُهَا
[I lodged the camels in their nightly resting-place];
both meaning the same. (T.) And it is said in a
trad., الحَمْدُ لِلّهِ الَّذِى كَفَانَا وَآوَانَا i. e. [Praise be
to God who hath sufficed us and] hath brought
us to a place of abode for us, and not made us to
be scattered like the beasts. (TA.) AHeyth disallowed ↓ أَوَيْتُ as syn. with آوَيْتُ; but it is correct.
(T.) It is said in a form of divorce, ↓ لَا يَأْوِينِى
وَإِيَّاكِ بَيْتٌ [A house, or tent, shall not lodge, or
comprise, me with thee]. (Mgh.) And among
other instances, is the saying of the Prophet, (T,)
الضَّالَّةٌ إلَّا ضَالٌّ ↓ لَا يَأْوِى [No one will harbour the
stray beast but a person straying from the right
course of conduct]. (T, Mgh.) And his saying,
الجَرِينُ ↓ لَا قَطْعَ فِى ثَمَرٍ حَتَّى يَأْوِيِه i. e. [There
shall be no cutting off of the hand in the case of
stealing fruit] unless the place where the fruit is
dried contain it [at the time of the stealing thereof].
(TA.) ―
-b2-  Hence, إِيوَآءُ خَشَبِ الفَحْمِ The throwing
of dust, or earth, upon the wood of which charcoal
is made, and covering it therewith. (Mgh.)
-A2-

تَاَوَّىَ see 1, first sentence. ―
-b2-  تَأَوَّتِ الطَّيْرُ The
birds collected, or flocked, together; (Lth, T, S,
M, K;) as also ↓ تَآوَت: (K:) the latter is allowable. (T.) And in like manner one says of other
things. (M.) [Thus,] one says, تَأَوَّتِ الخَيْلُ The
horses drew, or gathered, themselves together:
and تأوّى النَّاسُ The men did so. (T.) You say
also, of a wound, ↓ تآوى, and ↓ أَوَى, meaning
It drew together, for healing; and so تآزى, and
أَزَى: so in the Nawádir el-Aaráb. (T.)
-A2-  One
may also say, يَتَأَوَّى, without saying it with ه,
[i. e. يَتَأَوَّهُ,] meaning He says أَوْهِ. (Fr and T in
art. او.) [See also 2; and see art. اوه.]

one of the same paragraph.

اسْتَأْوَيْتُهُ I asked him, or desired him, to
compassionate me, or have mercy on me; syn.
اسْتَرْحَمْتُهُ. (T.) A poet (namely, Dhu-r-Rummeh, TA) says,
وَلَوْ أَنَّنى اسْتَأْوَيْتُهُ مَا أَوَى لِيَا
[And if I had asked him, or desired him, to compassionate me, he would not have compassionated
me]. (T, S.)
أُوَيَّةٌ dim. of آءٌ: see the letter ا.
آوِ or آوٍ: see 2.
-A2-  آوٍ [the part. n. of 1] has for
its pl. أُوِىٌّ [like one of the inf. ns. of 1]. (T, S.)
The latter is applied to birds, signifying Collecting, or flocking, together; (T, S, M, * K; *) syn.
↓ مُتَأَوِّيَةٌ (Lth, T) and مُتَأَوِّيَاتٌ. (Lth, T, S, M, K.)
اِبْنُ آوَى, a determinate noun, (S, M,) [The
jackal; vulgarly called in the present day وَاوِى;]
a certain small beast, (M, K,) called in Persian
شَغَالْ, (S,) or in that language [or in Turkish]
چَقَالْ: (TA:) it has been said to be the offspring
of the wolf; but is well known to be not of the
wolf-kind: (Msb;) آوَى is inseparable from ابن:
(M:) it is imperfectly decl., (T, S, Msb,) being
of the measure أَفْعَلُ, (S,) or regarded as such;
(Lth, T;) or because it has the quality of a proper
name and the measure of a verb : (Msb :) the
pl. is بَنَاتُ آوَى, (T, S, Msb, K,) though applying
to males [as well as females], like بَنَاتُ أَعْوَجَ and
بَنَاتُ لَبُون. (AHeyth, T.)
آوِىٌ and أَوَوِىٌّ, said to be rel. ns. of آيَةٌ; which
see, in, art. اى.
آيَةٌ, said by some to be originally أَوَيَةٌ:see
art. ا ى.
مَأْوًى (S, M, Msb, K) and ↓ مَأْوٍ and ↓ مَأْوَاهٌ (M,
K [but respecting these two forms see what follows]) nouns of place from the first of the verbs
in this art.; (M, K;) [A place to which one
betakes himself, or repairs, for lodging, covert,
or refuge; a refuge; an asylum; a place of
resort; (see 1;)] any place to which a thing
betakes itself, &c., (يَأْوِى إِلَيْهِ,) by night or. by
day; (S;) the lodging-place, or abode, of any
animal; the nightly resting-place of sheep or
goats; (Msb;) and of camels: (Idem in art.
روح:) ↓ مَأْوٍ is used peculiarly in relation to
camels: (S;) مَأْوِى الإِبِلِ being a dial. var. of
مَأْوَى الإِبِلِ, but anomalous, (Fr, T, S, Msb,) and
the only instance of the kind except مَأْقِى العَيْنِ:
(Fr, T, M: [but see art. مأق:]) مَأْوَى and مُؤْق
and مَأْق are the forms preferred: (Fr, T:) [Az
also says,] I have heard the chaste in speech of
the Benoo-Kiláb use, for مَأْوَى الإِبِلِ, the word
↓ مَأْوَاة. (T.) جَنَّةُ المَأْوَى, in the Kur [liii. 15],
is said to mean The paradise to which repair the
souls of the martyrs, (M, Bd, Jel, TA,) or the
pious, (Bd, Jel,) or the angels: (Jel:) or that
in which the night is passed. (TA.)
