اذى1
أَذِىَ, aor.
اَذَىَ, inf. n. أَذًى, (T, M, Msb, K,)
in [some of] the copies of the K written أَذًا, and
so by IB, (TA,) and أَذَآءٌ, (CK, [but not found
by me in any MS. copy of the K nor in any other
lexicon,]) and, accord. to IB, أَذَاةٌ and أَذِيَّةٌ,
(TA,) or these two are simple substs.; (M, K;)
and ↓ تأذّى; (T, S, M, Msb, K;) [He was, or
became, annoyed, molested, harmed, or hurt;]
he experienced, or suffered, slight evil, [i. e.,
annoyance, molestation, harm, or hurt,] less than
what is termed ضَرَر; (El-Khattábee;) or he
experienced, or suffered, what was disagreeable,
or hateful, or evil, (Msb, K,) in a small degree;
(K;) بِهِ [by him, or it]; (T, S, M, K;) [and
مِنْهُ from him, or it:] ↓ التَّأَذِّى signifies the being
affected by what is termed الأَذَى [i. e. what
annoys, molests, harms, or hurts, one]: and also
the showing the effect thereof; which is forbidden
by the saying of 'Omar, بِالنَّاسِ ↓ إِيَّاكَ وَالتَّأَذِّى
[Avoid thou, or beware thou of, showing the
being annoyed, molested, harmed, or hurt, by
men]; for this is what is within one's power.
(Mgh.) ―
-b2-  Also, aor. and inf. n. as above, It
(a thing) was unclean, dirty, or filthy. (Msb.)

آذى signifies فَعَلَ الأَذَى [He did what
annoyed, molested, harmed, or hurt]. (M, K.)
―
-b2-  And آذِاهُ, (T, S, M, Msb, K,) aor. يُؤْذِيهِ, (S,)
inf. n. إِيذَآءٌ (T, IB, Msb) and [quasi-inf. n.]
أَذِيَّةٌ, (T,) or أَذَّى and أَذَاةٌ and أَذِيَّةٌ, (S, K,) but
IB refuses his assent to this, saying that these
three are inf. ns. of أَذِىَ, and MF says of إِيذَآءٌ,
which is expressly disallowed by the author of
the K, though he himself uses it, that others
assert it to have been heard and transmitted, and
to be required by rule, but he adds that he had
searched for examples of it in the language of
the Arabs, and investigated their prose and their
poetry, without finding this word; (TA;) [He,
or it, annoyed him, molested him, harmed him,
or hurt him; or] he did what was disagreeable,
or hateful, or evil, to him. (Bd in xxxiii. 53,
Msb.) It is said in the Kur [xxxiii. 47],
وَدَعْ أَذَاهُمْ, meaning And leave thou the requiting
of them until thou receive a command respecting
them; (M, Bd, Jel;) namely, the hypocrites:
(M:) or leave thou unregarded their doing to
thee what is [annoying, molesting, harmful, hurtful, or] disagreeable, &c., to thee. (Bd.)
