استأهلهُ as signifying He was, or became,
worthy, or deserving, of it, or he merited it, or
he had a right, or just title or claim, to it, is not
allowable: (Msb, * MF:) not only does J disallow it, but the generality of those before him do
so; saying that it is not chaste: in the Fs it is
said to be of weak authority; and the expositors
thereof confirm this assertion, saying that it occurs,
but is inferior to other words in chasteness; and
El-Hareeree asserts it to be erroneous: (MF:) or
it is good in this sense; and J's disallowance of
it is of no account: (K:) Az and Z and Sgh and
others assert it to be good: and Az says, in the
T, some have asserted the saying فُلَانٌ يَسْتَأْهِلُ أَنْ
يُكْرَمَ أَوْ يُهَانَ, as meaning [Such a one] is worthy,
or deserving, [of being treated with honour, or of
being held in light estimation,] to be erroneous;
and الاِسْتِئْهَالُ to be only from الإِهَالَةُ; but I do
not disallow it, nor charge with error him who
says thus; for I have heard the verb thus used
by a chaste Arab of the desert, of the BenooAsad, and there was present a number of Arabs
of the desert who did not disapprove his saying:
and this is confirmed by the saying in the Kur
[lxxiv. 55], هُوَ أَهْلُ التَّقْوَي وَ أَهْلُ المَغْفِرَةِ [explained
below: see أَهْلُ]. (T.)
-A2-  استأهل, (JK, K,) or
استأهل الأَهَالَةَ, (Msb,) He took the إِهَالَةَ: (JK,
K:) or he ate the اهالة: see this word below.
(Msb, TA.)
أَهْلٌ [The people of a house or dwelling, and of
a town or village, and of a country: and the
family of a man:] a man's cohabitants of one
dwelling or place of abode, (Er-Rághib, Kull
p. 84,) and of one town or country: (Er-Rághib:)
afterwards applied to a man's fellow-members of
one family or race, and of one religion, and of
one craft or art or the like: (Er-Rághib, Kull:)
or, as some say, relations, whether they have
followers or dependents, or not; whereas آلٌ signifies relations with their followers or dependents:
(Kull:) or it originally signifies relations: and
sometimes is applied to followers or dependents:
and signifies also the أَهْل [i. e. people, or inhabitants, or family,] of a house or tent: (Msb:)
or a man's nearer, or nearest, relations by descent

or paternal uncle and son of a paternal uncle,
or strange or distantly-related child, whom a
man feeds or sustains in his abode: the most
particular, or most special, dependents, or the
like, of a man: on the authority of El-Ghooree:
(Mgh:) [J indicates some of these meanings merely
by saying that it signifies] the أَهْل of a man, and
the أَهْل of a house; as also ↓ أَهْلَةٌ: (S:) [see
also آلٌ; in the explanations of which, certain distinctions between it and أَهْلٌ will be found mentioned:] the pl. is أَهْلُونَ, [like أَرْضُونَ, a form
sometimes used for أَرَضُونَ] (Mgh, Msb, K,) and
أَهَالٍ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) with an additional ى [implied by the tenween, and expressed in the accus. case,
and when the word is determinate, as in الأَهَالِى,]
(S,) contr. to rule, (S, Mgh,) like لَيَالٍ, pl. of
لَيْلٌ, (S,) [and like أَرَاض, respecting which and
ليَالٍ and أَهَالٍ, see أَرْضٌ,] and آهَالٌ, (S, K,) a
pl. [of pauc.] sometimes occurring in poetry, (S,)
[like آرَاضٌ,] and أَهْلَاتٌ and أَهَلَاتٌ [as though
pls. of أَهْلَةٌ]. (S, K.) ―
-b2-  أَهْلُ البَيْتِ The [people
or] inhabitants [or family] of the house or tent.
(Mgh, K.) But أَوْصَى لأَهْلِ بَيْتِهِ means the same
as اوصى لِجِنْسِهِ, i. e. He left by will, of his

اهل as explained above in the first sentence on
the authority of the K: الأَهْلُ إِلَى الأَهْلِ أَسْرَعُ مِنَ
السِّيلِ إِلَى السَّهْلِ a prov. [meaning Kinsfolk are
quicker of tendency to kinsfolk than the torrent
to the plain]. (TA.) So, too, a saying of a poet
cited voce خَفْضٌ. (TA.) [And] أَهْلَكَ وَاللَّيْلَ a
prov. meaning بَادِر أَهْلَكَ وَاحْذَرِ اللَّيْلَ وَ ظُلْمَتَهُ

(Msb.) ―
-b9-  أَهْلُ النَّبِىِّ The [family or] wives
and daughters of the Prophet, and his son-in-law
'Alee: or his women; and (as some say, TA)
the men who are his آل; (K, TA;) comprising
the grandchildren (أَحْفَاد) and [other] progeny:

occurring also [in a like sense] in xi. 76: (TA:)
and الأَهْلُ is conventionally applied to the nearer,
or nearest, kinsfolk of the Prophet. (Er-Rághib.)
―
-b10-  أَهْلُ كُلِّ نَبِىٍّ also means The people to whom
any prophet is sent; (K, TA;) and those who
are of his religion. (TA.) ―
-b11-  In the phrase آلٌ
اللّٰهِ وَرَسُولِهِ, meaning The friends, or the like,
(أَوْلِيَآء K, TA,) and the assistants, (TA,) of God
and of his apostle, the first word is originally

well as his wife and children; (TA;) [so, too,
in the present day, أَهْلُ بَيْتِ الرَّجُلِ;] and so,
too, ↓ أَهْلَتُهُ. (K.) Hence the phrase بَنَى عَلَي
أَهْلِهِ [see art. بنىِ]: (Kull:) and دَخَلَ بِأَهْلِهِ and
دَخَلَ عَلَى أَهْلِهِ [see art. دخل]. (Har p. 502;
&c.) ―

just title, to such a thing; entitled thereto;
worthy, or deserving, thereof; meet, or fit, for
it: (S, K:) the vulgar say ↓ مُسْتَأْهِلٌ, which is
not allowable: (S:) or this assertion of J's is
of no account. (K: see 10.) You say, هُو أَهْلٌ
لِإِكْرَامِ He is entitled to be, or worthy of being,
treated with honour. (Msb.) And لِكُّلِ ↓ هُوَ أَهْلَةٌ

أهْلَ الثَنَآءِ وَالمَجْدِ [0 Thou who art the Being

of prayer, the first word is mansoob as a vocative:
and it may be marfooa, as the enunciative of
an inchoative suppressed; i. e. أَنْتَ أَهْلُ [Thou
art the Being entitled &c.]. (Msb.) ―
-b21-  [Frequently, also, أَهْلٌ signifies The author, or, more

آهِلٌ, (JK, S, Msb, K,) [said by those unacquainted with the verb أَهَلَ in the first of the
senses explained in this art. to be] a kind of
rel. n., (TA,) and ↓ مَأْهُولٌ, (JK, K,) A place
peopled, or inhabited: (Msb:) or a place having
people: (JK:) or the former has this signification; and the latter signifies having its people
in it: (ISk, K:) or the former has this last

occurring in a poem of Ru-beh [app. by poetic
licence for مَآهِيلُ]. (TA.) You say قَرْيَةٌ آهِلَةٌ
