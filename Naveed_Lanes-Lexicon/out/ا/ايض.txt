ايض1
آضَ, aor. يَئِيضُ, inf. n. أَيْضٌ, i. q. عَادَ;
(ISk, S, M, Msb, * K;) as in the phrase آضَ إِلَى
الشَّىْءِ [He returned to the thing, i. e. to the doing
of the thing; he did the thing again, or a second
time]. (K.) ―
-b2-  And i. q. رَجَعَ; (S, M, Msb, K;)
as in the phrase آضَ إِلَى أَهْلِهِ [He returned to his
family]. (S, M.) ―
-b3-  In the phrase فَعَلْتُ كَذَا
↓ أَيْضًا, the last word is the inf. n. of آضَ in the
sense of عَادَ, (ISK, IDrd, S, M, Msb, *) and in the
sense of رَجَعَ: (IDrd, M:) and the meaning is,
[I did such a thing again, or a second time;]
I returned to the doing of such a thing: (IDrd,
M:) or I did such a thing returning to what
had preceded. (Msb, K. *) [It also, and more
commonly, signifies I did such a thing also.]
When one says, ↓ فَعَلْتُ ذٰلِكَ أَيْضًا [I did that
again, &c.], you say, ↓ قَدْ أَكْيَرْتَ مِنْ أَيْضٍ [Thou
hast made much use of the expression أَيْضًا], and
↓ دَعْنِى مِنْ أَيْضٍ [Let me alone and cease from
using the expression أَيْضًا]. (ISk, S.) ―
-b4-  أَيْضٌ
also signifies (tropical:)  A thing's becoming another, or a
different, thing; and being changed from its
state or condition [to another and a different
state or condition]: (Lth, K: *) so says Kh.
(Ham p. 356.) And آضَ كَذَا (tropical:)  He, or it, became
such a thing. (Lth, S, M, * K.) You say, آضَ
سَوَادُ شَعَرِهِ بَيَاضًا (A, TA) (tropical:)  The blackness of his
hair became whiteness. (TA.) And Zuheyr says,
speaking of a land which he traversed,
قَطَعْتُ إِذَامَاالآلُ آضَ كَأَنَّهُ
سُيُوفٌ تُنَحَّى سَاعَةً ثُمَّ تَلْتَقِى
[I traversed, when the mirage, or the mirage of
the morning, became as though it were swords
which were removed a while, then met]. (S.)
أَيْضٌ and أَيْضًا: see above, in four places.
