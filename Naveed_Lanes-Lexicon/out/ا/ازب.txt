ازب1
أَزَبَ, aor.
اَزِبَ, (A, K,) inf. n. أَزْبٌ, (TK,) It
(water) flowed or ran; (A, K;) like وَزَبَ. (TA.)
مِئْزَابٌ, (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) and مِيزَابٌ, (S,
Msb,) A water-spout; a pipe, or channel, that
spouts forth water: (Mgh, TA:) or that by
which water pours down from a high place:
(Towsheeh:) or a water-spout of wood, or the
like, to convey away the water from the roof of
a house: (MF in art. زوب:) the former is from
the verb above mentioned: (A, K:) or it is
arabicized, (A, Mgh, K,) from the Persian, (Mgh,
K,) signifying “make water:” (K:) its pl. is
مَآزِيبُ: (ISk, S, Mgh, Msb:) and the pl. of
ميزاب is مَيَازِيبُ and مَوَازِيبُ, from وَزَبَ, said of
water, meaning “it flowed,” (Mgh, Msb,) accord.
to IAar; (Mgh;) or this is arabicized; or postclassical: (Msb:) but ميزاب, without ء, is altogether disallowed by Yaakoob [i. e. ISk]:
(Mgh:) it is also called مِرْزَابٌ, (T, S, Msb,)
accord. to IAar; (T, Msb;) but this is disallowed
by ISk, Fr, and AHát, (Msb,) and by Az
[the author of the T]; (Mgh;) and مِزْرَابٌ also,
accord. to IAar and Lth and others, as is mentioned in the T. (Msb.)
