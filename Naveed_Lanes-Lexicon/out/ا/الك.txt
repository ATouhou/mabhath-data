أَلَكَ الِلّجَامَ, (ISd, K,) [aor.
اَلُكَ or
اَلِكَ,] inf. n.
أَلْكٌ, (ISd, TA,) He (a horse) chewed, or champed,
the bit; syn. عَلَكَهُ. (ISd, K.) One says, of a
horse, يألكُ اللُّجُمَ He chews, or champs, the bits:
but the verb commonly known is يَلُوكَ, or يَعْلُكُ.
(Lth.) ―
-b2-  [Hence, accord. to some, (see أَلُوكٌ,)]
أَلَكَ بَيْنَ القَوْمِ, (Msb, TA,) aor.
اَلِكَ, inf. n. أَلْكٌ
and أُلُوكٌ, (Msb,) He acted as a messenger (تَرَسَّلَ)
between the people. (Msb, TA.) ―
-b3-  And أَلَكَهُ,
aor.
اَلِكَ, inf. n. أَلْكٌ, He conveyed, or communicated,
to him a message. (Kr.) ―
-b4-  And أَلَكَ He sent.
(IB in art. لوك.)

أَلِكْنِى is from أَلَكَ signifying “he sent;”
and is originally أَأْلِكْنِى; the [second] hemzeh
being transposed and placed after the ل, it
becomes أَلْئِكْنِى; then the hemzeh has its vowel
transferred to the ل and is thrown out; as is
done in the case of مَلَكٌ, which is originally مَأْلَكٌ,
then مَلْأَكٌ, and then مَلَكٌ: (IB in art. لوك:) it
means Be thou my messenger; and bear thou
my message; and is often used by the poets.
(S in art. لوك.) Accord. to IAmb, one says,
أَلِكْنِى إِلَى فُلَانٍ, meaning send thou me to such
a one: [but I do not know any instance in
which this meaning is applicable:] and the
original form is أَلْئِكْنِى; or, if from الأَلُوكُ, the
original form is أَأْلِكْنِى: and he also says that
it means be thou my messenger to such a one.
(TA.) One says also, أَلِكْنِى إِلَيْهَا بِرِسَالَةٍ, which
should properly mean Send thou me to her with
a message: but it is an inverted phrase; since
the meaning is, be thou my messenger to her
with this message [or rather with a message]:
and أَلِكْنِى إِلَيْهَا بِالسَّلَامِ i. e. convey thou, or communicate thou, to her my salutation; or be thou
my messenger to her [with salutation]: and sometimes this [prep.] ب is suppressed, so that one
says, أَلِكْنِى إِلَيْهَا السَّلَامَ: sometimes, also, the
person sent is he to whom the message is sent;
as in the saying, أَلِكْنِى إِلَيْكَ السَّلَامَ [virtually
meaning receive thou my salutation; but literally]
be thou my messenger to thyself with salutation.
(TA.) Lh mentions the phrase أَلَكْتُهُ إِلَيْهِ, with
respect to a message, aor. أُلِيكُهُ, inf. n. إِلَاكَهٌ;
in which case, the hemzeh [in the aor. and inf. n.]
is converted into a letter of prolongation. (TA
in art. لأك.)

تَاَلَّكَ see أَلُوكٌ.

استألك مَأْلُكَتَهُ He bore, or conveyed, his
message; (K;) as also استلأك. (TA.)
أَلُوكٌ A thing that is eaten [or rather chewed,
as will be seen below]: so in the phrases,
هذَا أَلُوكُ صِدْقٍ like عَلُوجُ صِدْقٍ and عَلُوكُ صِدْقٍ
[This is an excellent thing that is chewed], and
مَا تَلَوَّكْتُ بِأَلُوكٍ  [or بِأَلُوكٍ ↓ مَا تَأَلَّكْتُ (K in art.
علج)] like مَا تَعَلَّجْتُ بِعَلُوجٍ [app. meaning
I have not occupied myself in chewing with anything that is chewed]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [And hence,
accord. to some,] A message, or communication
sent from one person or party to another; (Lth,
S, M, K, &c.; [in the CK, after الرِّسالَةُ, by
which الأَلُوكُ is explained in the K &c., we find
قِبَلَ المَلِكِ مُشْتَقٌّ منهُ, in which the first two
words should be قِيلَ المَلَكُ, as in other copies of
the K and in the TA; and الاُلُوكُ is erroneously
put, in the CK, for الأَلُوكُ;]) said by Lth and
ISd to be so called because it is [as it were]
chewed in the mouth; (TA;) as also ↓ أَلُوكَهٌ
(ISd, Sgh, K) and ↓ مَأْلُكَةٌ (Lth, S, Msb, K, &c.)
and ↓ مَأْلَكَةٌ (Msb, K) and ↓ مَأْلُكٌ: (S, M, Msb.
K, &c.:) accord. to Kr, (TA,) this last is the
only word of the measure مَفْعُلٌ: (K, TA:) but
accord. to Sb and Akh, there is no word of this
measure: (TA:) [i. e. there is none originally
of this measure:] other instances have been mentioned; namely, مَكْرُمٌ and مَعُونٌ [originally
مَعْوُنٌ] and مَقْبُرٌ and مَهْلُكٌ and مَيْسُرٌ, which last
occurs in the Kur [ii. 280], accord. to one reading, in the words فَنَظِرَةٌ إِلَى مَيْسُرِهِ; but it is said
that each of these, and مَأْلُكٌ also, may be regarded
as originally with ة; or, accord. to AHei, each
is [virtually, though not in the language of
the grammarians,] a pl. of the same with ة;
(MF, TA;) and Akh says the same with respect
to مَكْرُمٌ and مَعُونٌ: (TA:) Seer says that each
is curtailed of ة by poetic licence; but this assertion will not apply to مَيْسُرٌ, as it occurs in the
Kur. (MF, TA.) ―
-b3-  أَلُوكٌ also signifies A messenger. (Ibn-'Abbád, K. [In the CK here follows, والمأْلُوْكُ والمَأْلُقُ: but the right reading is
وَالمَأْلُوكُ المَأْلُوقُ, as in other copies and in the
TA.])
أَلُوكَهٌ: see أَلُوكٌ.
مَأْلَكٌ is said to be the original form of مَلَكٌ
[An angel; so called because he conveys, or
communicates, the message from God; (K, * TA,
in art. لأك;)] derived from أَلُوكٌ; (Msb, K, TA;
[but in the CK is a mistake here, pointed out
above, voce أَلُوكٌ;]) so that the measure of مَلَكٌ
is مَعَلٌ: (Msb:) مَلَكٌ is both sing. and pl.: Ks
says that it is originally مَأْلَكٌ, from أَلُوكٌ signifying
“a message;” then, by transposition, مَلْأَكٌ, a
form also in use; and then, in consequence of
frequency of usage, the hemzeh is suppressed,
so that it becomes مَلَكٌ; but in forming the pl.,
they restore it to مَلْأَكٌ, saying مَلَائِكَةٌ, and مَلَائِكُ
also: (S in art. ملك:) or, accord. to some, it is
from لَأَكَ “he sent;” so that the measure of مَلَكٌ
is مَفَلٌ: and there are other opinions respecting
it: (Msb:) some say that its م is a radical: see
art. ملك. (TA in art. لأك.)
مَأْلُكٌ: see أَلُوكٌ.
مَأْلَكَةٌ: see أَلُوكٌ.
مَأْلَكَةٌ: see أَلُوكٌ.
