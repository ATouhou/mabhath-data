اجر1
أَجَرَهُ, aor.
اَجُرَ and
اَجِرَ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) which
latter form of the aor., though known to most of
the lexicologists, is disacknowledged by a few of
them, (TA,) inf. n. أَجْرٌ; (S, Msb;) and ↓ آجرهُ,
(S, Mgh, Msb, K,) a form disacknowledged by
As, but said by some to be the more chaste of the
two, of the form أَفْعَلَ, not فَاعَلَ, as IKtt by
evident inadvertence makes it to be by saying that
its aor. is يُؤَاجِرُ, (TA,) inf. n. إِيجَارٌ; (S;) He
(God, S, A, Mgh, Msb, and a man, Mgh) recompensed, compensated, or rewarded, him, (S, A, Mgh,
Msb, K,) عَلَي مَا فَعَلَ for what he had done. (A.)
[See أَجْرٌ, below.] أُجِرَ فُلَانٌ خَمْسَةً مِنْ وَلَدِهِ [Such
a one became entitled to a reward for five of his
children, by their death, (for it is believed that the
Muslim will be rewarded in Paradise for a child
that has died in infancy)], (S,) and أُجِرَ وَلَدَهُ, (A,)
and أُجِرَ فِي أَوْلَادِهِ, (K,) mean that his children
died, and became [causes of] his reward. (S, A,
K.) ―
-b2-  أَجَرَهُ, (K,) aor.
اَجُرَ, (S,) [He served him
for hire, pay, or wages;] he became his hired
man, or hireling. (S, K.) So in the Kur xxviii. 27.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  أَجَرَهُ, aor.
اَجُرَ, (L, Msb, K,) and
اَجِرَ,
(Msb, K,) inf. n. أَجْرٌ, (L, K,) He let him (namely
his slave) on hire, or for pay, or wages; (L, *
Msb, * K;) as also ↓ آجرهُ, inf. n. إِيجَارٌ; ('Eyn,
Mgh, Msb, K;) and ↓ آجرهُ, inf. n. مؤاجرة: (K:)
all these are good forms of speech, used by the
Arabs: (L:) or ↓ آجرهُ having for its inf. n. مؤاجرة
signifies he appointed him (namely another man)
hire, pay, or wages, for his work; (Mj, Mgh;) or
he engaged with him to give him hire, pay, or
wages; (A, Mgh, Msb;) and can have only one
objective complement: whereas, ↓ when it is of
the measure أَفْعَلَ it is doubly trans.; (Mgh, Msb;)
so that one says, مَمْلُوكَهُ ↓ آجَرَنِي He let me his
slave on hire. (Mgh.) One also says, أَجَرَ الدَّارَ,
aor.
اَجُرَ and
اَجِرَ, inf. n. أَجْرٌ, He let the house on hire;
and so الدَّارَ ↓ آجر, [inf. n. إِيجَارٌ:] (Msb, TA:)
and الدَّارَ ↓ آجرهُ, [inf. n. إِيجَارٌ,] He let to him the
house on hire: (S, A, Mgh, Msb:) the latter verb
being of the measure أَفْعَلَ, not of the measure
فَاعَلَ: (A, Mgh, Msb:) and the vulgar say, وَاجَرَ:
(S:) some, however, say, الدَّارَ ↓ آجَرْتُ, inf. n.
مُؤَاجَرَةٌ, making the verb of the measure فاعل:
(Msb, TA:) some also say, الدَّارَ زَيْدَّا ↓ آجَرْتُ [I
let the house to Zeyd], inverting the order of
the words: (Msb, TA:) and the lawyers say,
الدَّارَ مِنْ زَيْدٍ ↓ آجَرْتُ [in the same sense, like as
بِعْتُ مِنْ زَيْدٍ الدَّارِ means the same as بِعْتُ زَيْداً
الدَّارَ]. (Msb: [but in the Mgh, the like of this
is said to be vulgar.])
3
آجر, inf. n. مُؤَاجَرَةٌ: see 1, latter half, in
three places: and see 10. One says also, of a
woman, (K,) or a whorish female slave, (TA,)
آجَرَتْ, [of the measure فَاعَلَتْ, not أَفْعَلَتْ, (see مُؤْجِرٌ,
below,)] meaning She prostituted herself for hire.
(K.)
4
آجَرَتٌ, inf. n. إِيجَارٌ: see 1, first sentence: ―
-b2-
and see the latter half of the same paragraph, in
seven places.

ائتجر [written with the disjunctive alif اِيتَجَرَ]
He gave alms, seeking thereby to obtain a reward
[from God]: (L, K *:) and ائتجربِهِ He gave it
as alms, seeking thereby a reward. (L.) اتَّجَرَ for
ائتجر is not allowable, because ء cannot be incorporated into ت: [or, accord. to some, this is
allowable, as in اتَّزَرَ for ائتزر, and اتَّمَنَ for ائتمن,
&c.:] Hr allows it; and cites an ex. in a trad.;
but IAth says that the proper reading in this
instance is يَأْتَجِرُ, not يَتَّجِرُ; or, if the latter be
allowed, it is from التِّجَارَةُ, not from الأَجْرُ. (L.)
―
-b2-  اُوتُجِرَ عَلَيْهِ بِكَذَا [in which the radical ء is
changed into و because the alif preceding it is
made disjunctive and with damm, (in one copy of
the S, and in the L and TA, erroneously written
اِيْتَجَرَ,) He was hired to do it for such a sum or
thing, (see مُؤْتَجَرٌ, below,)] is from الأُجْرَةُ. (S, L.)
10
استأجرهُ, (S, K,) and ↓ آجرهُ, (K,) [the
latter of the measure فَاعَلَ, as has been clearly shown
above, from the A and Mgh and Msb,] He hired
him; took him as a hired man, or hireling. (S,
K, TA.) You say also, استأجر الدَّارَ [He hired the
house; took it on hire]. (A, Mgh,)
أَجْرٌ A recompense, compensation, or reward,
(S, K, &c.,) for what one has done; (K;) i. q.
ثَوَابٌ; (S;) as also ↓ إِجَارَةٌ and ↓ أَجَارَةٌ and ↓ أٌجَارَةٌ,
(K,) of which three forms the first is the most
generally known and the most chaste, (TA,) and
↓ أُجْرَةٌ: (TA:) or, as some say, there is a distinction between أَجْرٌ and ثَوَابٌ: El-'Eynee says, in
the Expos. of El-Bukháree, that what is obtained by
the fundamental practices of the law, and by obligatory religious services, is termed ثواب; and what
is obtained by supererogatory acts of religion, اجر;
for ثواب is properly a substitute for a thing itself;
and اجر, for the profit arising from a thing; though
each is sometimes used in the sense of the other:
(TA:) it is well known that اجر signifies a
recompense, or reward, from God to a man, for
righteous conduct; (MF;) and ↓ إِجَارَةٌ, recompense, compensation, hire, pay, or wages, from
one man to another, for work; (Mgh, MF;) and
hence الأَجِيرُ; (MF;) and ↓ أُجْرَةٌ also has this
latter signification, (Mgh, TA,) and is syn. with
كِرَآءٌ; (S, Mgh, K;) [signifying likewise rent for
a house, and the like;] but أَجْرٌ is used [sometimes]
in the sense of إِجَارَةٌ and in that of أُجْرَةٌ: (Msb:)
the pl. of أَجْرٌ is أُجُورٌ (Msb, K) and آجَارٌ; (K;)
but the latter form was unknown to MF: (TA:)
the pl. of ↓ أُجْرَةٌ is أَجَرٌ and أُجُرَاتٌ and أُجَرَاتٌ.
(Msb.) [One says, أَجْرُكَ عَلَي اللّٰهِ Thy recompense is due from God. And, to console a person
for the death of a relation or friend, عَظَّمَ اللّٰهُ أَجْرَكَ
فِيهِ May God largely compensate thee for him!
i. e., for the loss of him.] By the expression
أَجْرٍ كِرِيمٍ in the Kur xxxvi. 10 is said to be
meant Paradise. (TA.) ―
-b2-  (tropical:)  A dowry, or nuptial gift; a gift that is given to, or for, a bride:
(K:) pl. أُجُورٌ: so in the Kur xxxiii. 49 [&c.].
(TA.) ―
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  Praise; good fame. (K.) So, as
some say, in the Kur xxix. 26. (TA.)

measure مُفَاعَلٌ, i. e. a man with whom one has
engaged to give him hire, pay, or wages: (Mgh,
Msb: *) pl. أُجَرَآءُ. (L, Msb.)
إِجَارَةٌ and أَجَارَةٌ and أُجَارَةٌ: see أَجْرٌ, in four
places. ―
-b2-  إِجَارَةٌ also signifies The giving of usufructs for a compensation. (Mgh.) ―
-b3-  And Land
which its owners have let to him who will build
upon it: so explained by the lawyers. (Mgh.)
إِجَّارٌ (S, M, IAth, Mgh, K) and ↓ إِجَّارَةٌ (M)
and ↓ إِنْجَارٌ (Mgh, K) The flat top, or roof, of a
house, (S, M, IAth, Mgh, K,) that has not around
it anything to prevent a person's falling from it:
(M, * IAth:) of the dial. of the people of Syria
and of El-Hijáz: (S:) pl. [of the first and second]
أَجَاجِيرُ and أَجَاجِرَةٌ; (A'Obeyd, S, K;) and [of
the third] أَنَا جِيرُ. (Mgh, K.)

إِجِّيرَى (ISk, K) and ↓ إِجْرِيَّا and ↓ إِجْرِيَّآءُ (S in
art. هجر) A custom; a habit. (ISk, K, and S
ubi suprà.) The hemzeh is said to be a substitute
for ه [in هِجِّيرَى &c.] (TA.) You say, مَا زَالَ
ذٰلِكَ إِجِّيرَاهُ That ceased not to be his custom, or
habit. (ISk.)
آجَرٌ and آجُرٌ and آجِرٌ, and the pls. آجُرُونَ and
آجِرُونَ: see what next follows.
آجُرٌّ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and ↓ آجُرٌّ (AA, Ks, K)
and ↓ آجُورٌ (S, K) and ↓ أَجُورٌ and ↓ يَاجُورٌ (K) and
↓ أَجُرٌ (as in some copies of the K) and ↓ آجَرٌ, (as
in some copies of the K and in the TA,) or
↓ أُجُرٌ, (as in other copies of the K,) and ↓ آجِرٌ
[to which is erroneously added in the CK آجِرَةٌ]
and [the pls.] ↓ آجُرُونَ and ↓ آجِرُونَ (K) are syn.,
(S, K,) of Persian origin, (S,) [from آگُورْ or آگُرْ,]
arabicized, (S, Mgh, K,) signifying Baked bricks;
(Msb;) baked clay, (Mgh, L,) with which one
builds: (S, L:) آجُرٌّ and آجُورٌّ and آجُرٌ [&c.] are
pls., [or rather coll. gen. ns., except the two forms
ending with و and ن,] and their sings. [or rather
ns. un.] are with ة, i. e. آجُرَّةٌ &c. (L.)
آجُورٌ: see آجُرٌّ.
إِنْجَارٌ: see إِجَّارٌ.
مُؤْجَرٌ [A slave, or] a house, let on hire; (Akh,
T, Msb;) as also ↓ مَأْجُورٌ; (L;) and some say,
↓ مُؤَاجَرٌ. (Akh, Msb.)
مُؤْجِرٌ One who lets on hire [a slave, or] a house:
one should not say ↓ مُوَاجِرٌ; for this is wrong
with respect to the classical language, and abominable with respect to the conventional acceptation
and common usage; a foul reproach being meant
thereby [as is shown by the explanation of آجَرَتْ,
given above: or, accord to some, it is allowable
when it relates to a house: (see أَجَرَهُ:) it seems
to be disallowed only when used absolutely].
(A, Mgh.)
مَأْجُورٌ: see مُؤْجَرٌ.
مُؤَاجَرٌ: see مُؤْجَرٌ.
مُؤَاجِرٌ: see مُؤْجِرٌ.
مُؤْتَجَرَ [part. n. of اُوتُجِرَ]. Mohammad Ibn-Bishr El-Khárijee, not [as is said in the S] Aboo-Dahbal, says, (L,)
يَا لَيْتَ أَنِّى بِأَثْوَابِي وَ رَاحِلَتِى
عَبْدٌ لِأَهْلِكَ هٰذَا الشَّهْرَ مُؤْتَجَرُ
[O would that I were, with my clothes and my
riding-camel, a hired slave to thy family, this
month]: (S, L.) i. e., مَعَ أَثْوَابِي. (S.)
