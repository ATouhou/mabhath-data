اوأَوْ a conjunction, (M, Mughnee, K,) to which
the later authors have ascribed meanings amounting to twelve: (Mughnee:) a particle which,
when occurring in an enunciative phrase, [generally] denotes doubt, and vagueness of meaning;
and when occurring in an imperative or a prohibitive phrase, [generally] denotes the giving of
option, or choice, and the allowing a thing, or
making it allowable. (S.) ―
-b2-  First, (Mughnee,) it
denotes doubt. (T, S, M, Msb, Mughnee, K.) So in
the saying, رَأَيْتُ زَيْدًا أَوْ عَمْرًا [I saw Zeyd or
'Amr]. (T, * S, Msb.) And جَآنِى رَجُلٌ أَوِ امْرَأَةٌ
[A man or a woman came to me]. (Mbr, T.)
And لَبِئْنَا يَوْمًا أَوْ بَعْضَ يَوْمٍ [in the Kur xviii. 18
and xxiii. 115, We have remained a day or part
of a day]. (Mughnee.) ―
-b3-  Secondly, (Mughnee,)
it denotes vagueness of meaning. (S, Msb, Mughnee, K.) S [it may be used] in the first of the
.exs. given above. (Msb.) And so in the saying,
وَأَنَّا أَوْ إِيَّاكُمْ لَعَلَى هُدًي أَوْ فِى ضَلَالٍ مُبِينٍ [And
verily we or ye are following a right direction or
in manifest error], (S, Mughnee,) in the Kur
[xxxiv. 23]; (S;) the ex. being in the former او.
(Mughnee.) ―
-b4-  Thirdly, (Mughnee,) it denotes
the giving of option, or choice. (T, S, M, Mughnee, K.) So in the saying, كُلِ السَّمَكَ أَوِ اشْرَبِ
اللَّبَنَ [Eat thou the fish, or drink thou the milk];
i. e. do not thou both of these actions; (Mbr, T,
S;) but choose which of them thou wilt. (Mbr,
T.) And تَزَوَّجْ هِنْدًا أَوْ أُخْتَهَا [Take thou as wife
Hind or her sister]. (Mughnee.) And [in like
manner] it denotes the making choice. (T.) [So
when you say, سَأَتَزَوَّجُ هِنْدًا أَوْ أُخْتَهَا, meaning I
will take as wife Hind or her sister; whichever
of them I choose.] ―
-b5-  Fourthly, (Mughnee,) it
denotes the allowing a thing, or making it allowable. (T, S, Msb, Mughnee, K.) So in the saying,
جَالِسِ حَسَنَ أَوِ ابْنَ سِيرِينَ [Sit thou with El-
Hasan or Ibn-Seereen]. (Mbr, T, S.) And
قُمْ أَوِ اقْعُدْ [Stand thou or sit]: and the person
to whom this is said may do [one or] both of
the se actions. (Msb.) [And similar exs. are
given in the Mughnee.]) But وَلَا تُطِعْ مِنْهُمْ آثِمًا
أَو كَفُورًا [in the Kur lxxvi. 24, And obey not
thou, of them, a sinner or a person very ungrateful to God,] means that thou shalt not obey
either of such persons: (Mbr, T, Mughnee:) in
which case او is more forcible than وَ; for when
you say to a person, لَا تُطِعْ زَيْدًا وَعَمْرًا [Obey not
thou Zeyd and 'Amr], he may obey one of them,
since the command is that he shall not obey the
two. (Zj, T.) ―
-b6-  Fifthly, (Mughnee,) it denotes
unrestricted conjunction. (Mughnee, K.) So in
the saying, in the Kur [iv. 46 and v. 9], أَوْ جَآءَ
أَحَدٌ مِنْكُمْ مِنَ الغَائِطِ [And if any one of you
cometh from the privy]; (TA;) [where, however,
it may also be rendered or, though] meaning
وَجَآءَ; (T, TA;) the و in this explanation being
what is termed a denotative of state. (T.) So,
too, accord. to AZ, in the expression أَوْ يَزِيدُونَ
[And they exceeded that number], in the Kur
[xxxvii. 147]: but see below. (TA.) And so in
the words, أَوْ أَنْ نَفْعَلَ فِى أَمْوَالِنَا مَا نَشَآءُ [And
our doing, in respect of our possessions, what we
will], in the Kur [xi. 89]. (T, TA.) ―
-b7-  Sixthly,
it denotes transition, (Mughnee,) used in the
sense of [the adversative particle] بَلْ, (T, S, M,
Mughnee, K,) in a case of amplification of speech;
(S;) accord. to Sb, on two conditions; that it
shall be preceded by a negation or a prohibition,
and that the agent shall be mentioned a second
time; as in مَا قَامَ زَيْدٌ أَوْ مَا قَامَ عَمْرٌو [Zeyd did
not stand: nay, rather 'Amr did not stand]; and
لَا يَقْمٌ زَيدٌ أَوْ لَا يَقُمْ عَمْرُو [Let not Zeyd stand:
nay, rather let not 'Amr stand]. (Mughnee.)
Accord. to Fr, (Th, M, Mughnee,) it has this
meaning in أَوْ يَزِيدُونَ [Nay, rather they exceeded
that number], (Th, S, M, Mughnee,) in the Kur
[xxxvii. 147, cited above]: (S:) or the meaning
is, or they would exceed [that number] in your
estimation: or these words with those preceding
them in the same verse mean, we sent him to a
multitude of whom, if ye saw them, ye would say,
They are a hundred thousand, or they exceed
[that number]; (M, Mughnee; *) so that it denotes doubt on the part of men, not of God, for
He is not subject to doubt: (M:) or we sent him
to a hundred thousand in the estimation of men,
or they exceeded [that number] in the estimation
of men; for God does not doubt: (S:) or او is
here used to denote vagueness of meaning: (IB,
Mughnee:) or, it is said, to denote that a person
might choose between saying, “they are a hundred
thousand,“ and saying, “they are more;“ but this
may not be when one of the two things is the
fact: or, accord. to some of the Koofees, it has
the meaning of وَ: and each of these meanings,
except the last, has been assigned to او as occurring in the Kur ii. 69 and xvi. 79. (Mughnee.) ―
-b8-
Seventhly, it denotes division; (Mughnee, K; *)
as in the saying, الكَلِمَةُ اسْمٌ أَوْ فِعْلٌ أَوْ حَرْفٌ [The
word is a noun or a verb or a particle]: so said
Ibn-Málik: or, as he afterwards said, in preference, it denotes separation (التَّفرِيق) divested
of the attribute of denoting doubt and vagueness
of meaning and the giving of option or choice;
adducing as one of his exs. of this meaning the
saying, وَقَالُوا كُونُوا هُودًا أَوْ نَصَارَى [in the Kur
ii. 129, And they said, “Be ye Jews” or “Christians”]; because the use of و in division is better;
as when you say, الكَلِمَةُ اسْمٌ وَفِعْلٌ وَحَرْفٌ: or it
denotes, accord. to some, distinction (التَّفْصِيل);
and the meaning of the ex. last cited, say they, is,
and the Jews said, “Be ye Jews,” and the Christians said, “Be ye Christians.” (Mughnee.) It
is [said to be] used in this last sense (that of
التفضيل) in the saying, كُنْتُ آكُلُ اللَّحْمَ أَوِ العَسَلَ
[I used to eat flesh-meat or honey]; i. e. I used
to eat flesh-meat one time and honey another time:
and so in the Kur vii. 3 and x. 13. ―
-b9-  Eighthly,
(Mughnee,) it is used in the sense of the exceptive
إِلَّا, (Mughnee, K,) or إِلَّا أَنْ (M;) and in this
case the aor. after it is mansoob, because of أَنْ
suppressed. (Mughnee, K.) So in the saying,
لَأَقْتُلَنَّهُ أَوْ يُسْلِمَ [I will assuredly slay him or he
shall become a Muslim; i. e., unless he become a
Muslim]. (Mughnee. [And a similar ex. is given
in the M.]) So, too, in the saying,
وَكُنْتُ إِذَا غَمَزْتُ قَنَاةَ قَوْمٍ
كَسَرْتُ كُعُوبَهَا أَوْ تَسْتَقِيمَا
[And I used, when I pinched and pressed the
spear of a people, to break its knots, or joints, or
its internodal portions, (the shaft being a cane,)
or, i. e. unless, it became straight]: (Mughnee,
K: *) a prov., of which the author is Ziyád ElAajam; meaning, when a people behaved with
hardness to me, I endeavoured to soften them:
(TA in art. غمز:) thus related by Sb, the verb
ending it being rendered mansoob by او; and thus
he heard it from some one or more of the Arabs;
but in the original verses, which are but three, it
is تَسْتَقِيمُ, with refa. (IB and TA in art. غمز.)
[And similar to these above are the sayings,] إنَّهُ
لِفُلَانٍ أَوْمَا بِنَجْدٍ قَرظَهُ [Verily it belongs to such
a one or there is not, i. e. unless there be not, in
Nejd, a قَرَظَة (see art. قرظ)]: and لَآتِيَنَّكَ أَوْ مَا
بِنَجْدٍ قَرَظَةٌ [I will assuredly come to thee or there
is not, i. e. unless there be not, in Nejd, a قَرَظَة];
meaning I will assuredly come to thee, in truth.
(T.) ―
-b10-  Ninthly, (Mughnee,) it is used in the
sense of إِلَى, (Mughnee, K,) or إِلَى أَنْ; (S;) in
which case also the aor. after it is mansoob, because of أَنْ suppressed: (Mughnee:) and in the
sense of حَتَّى [which is also syn. with إِتَى]. (Fr,
T, M, K.) So in the saying, لَأَضْرِبَنَّهُ أَوْ يَتُوبَ [I
will assuredly beat him until he repent]. (S.
[And similar exs. of او as explained by حَتَّي are
given in the T (from Fr) and in the M and in the
Mughnee.]) And so in the saying of the poet,
لَأَسْتَسْهِلَنَّ الصَّعْبَ أَوْ أُدْرِكَ المُنَى
فَمَا انْقَادَتِ الآمَالُ إِلَّا لِصَابِرِ
[I will assuredly deem easy what is difficult until
I attain the objects of wish; for hopes become
not easy of accomplishment save to one who
is patient]. (Mughnee.) ―
-b11-  Tenthly, some say,
(Mughnee,) it denotes nearness [of one event
or thing to another]; as in the saying, مَا أَدْرِى
أَسَلَّمَ أَوْ وَدَّعَ [I know not whether he saluted or
bade farewell]: (Mughnee, K: [but in the CK
this ex. is misplaced:]) this, however, is manifestly wrong; او being here used to denote doubt,
and the denoting of nearness being only inferred
from the fact of the saluting being confounded
in the mind with the bidding farewell, since this
is impossible or improbable when the two times
are far apart. (Mughnee.) ―
-b12-  Eleventhly, (Mughnee,) it occurs as a conditional, (T, Mughnee, K,)
accord. to Ks alone; (T;) or rather as a conjunctive and conditional; وَإِنْ being meant to be
understood in its place; though in truth the verb
that precedes it indicates that the conditional
particle [إِنْ] is meant to be understood [before
that verb], and او retains its proper character,
but forms part of that which has a conditional
meaning because conjoined with a preceding conditional phrase. (Mughnee.) So in the saying,
لَأَضْرِبَنَّهُ عَاشَ أَوْ مَاتَ, (Mughnee, K,) i. e., إِنْ
عَاِض بَعْدَ الضَّرْبِ وَ إِنْ مَاتَ [I will assuredly
beat him if he live (after the beating) or if he
die]: so says Ibn-Esh-Shejeree. (Mughnee.) ―
-b13-
Twelfthly, accord. to Ibn-Esh-Shejeree, on the
authority of some one or more of the Koofees,
(Mughnee,) it denotes division into parts, or portions; as in the saying [in the Kur ii. 129, before
cited,] وَقَالُوا كُونُوا هُودًا أَو نَصَارَى, (Mughnee, K,)
i. e. And they said, “Be ye, some of you, Jews,
and, some of you, Christians:” (TA:) but [IHsh
says,] it appears to me that the meaning here is
that of التَّفْصِيل mentioned before. (Mughnee.)
―
-b14-  [In the K it is said to occur also in the sense
of أَنْ: but this is evidently a mistake, app. originating in one of the two principal sources of the
K, namely, the M, in which the same is said, but
is exemplified by a phrase in which it is explained
by إِلَّا أَنْ, the eighth of the meanings of أَوْ mentioned above.] ―
-b15-  See also أَوٌّ below.
أَوَ in أَوَ لَمْ يَرَوْا &c. is [the conjunction] وَ with
the interrogative ا prefixed to it. (Fr, T.)
أَوِّ مِنْ كَذَا (T, M) and أَوَّ (M) [Alas, on
account of, or for, such a thing!] an expression
denoting complaint of distress, or of anxiety, or of
grief or sorrow; (T;) or an expression of grief
or sorrow; (M;) like ↓ آوِ and ↓ آوٍ and ↓ أَوَتَاه
(K and TA in art. اوه,) or ↓ أَوَتَاهُ (CK in that art.,)
or ↓ أَوَّتَاه, or ↓ آوَّتَاه, (S in that art., [the ه in one
copy of which is marked as quiescent,]) and like
آهِ and أَوْهِ &c. (S and Msb and K in art. اوه: see
آهِ in that art.) AZ says, one says, أَوْهِ عَلَى زَيْدٍ
[meaning Alas, for Zeyd!] with kesr to the ه,
and عَلَيْكَ ↓ أَوَّتَا [thus without ه, meaning Alas,
for thee!] with ت; an expression of regret for a
thing, whether of great or mean account. (T.)
أَوٌّ The word ↓ أَوْ when made a noun. (T, K.) So
say the grammarians. (T.) You say, هٰذهِ أَوٌّحَسَنَةٌ
[This is a good أَوْ]. (T.) And to one who uses
the phrase أَفْعَلُ كَذَا أَوْ كَذَا, (T,) you say, دَعِ
الأَوَّجَانِبًا [Let thou, or leave thou, the word أَوْ
alone]. (T, K.)
أَوَّةٌ [A moaning (see its syn. آهَةٌ in art. اوه)] is
said by some to be of the measure فَعْلَةٌ, in which
the ة is the sign of the fem. gender; for they say,
سَمِعْتُ أَوَّتَكَ [I heard thy moaning], making it
ت: and so says Lth; أَوَّةٌ is after the manner of
فَعْلَةٌ: (T:) you say, أَوَّةً لَكَ [May God cause
moaning to thee!], (Lth, T, and S in art. اوه,)
and آهَةً لَكَ: [but accord. to J, the former of these
is cognate with the latter; for he says that] the
former is with the ه suppressed, and with teshdeed
to the و. (S in art. اوه, where see آهَةٌ.) ―
-b2-  أَوَّتَا عَلَيكَ;
and أَوَّتَاه, or آوَّتَاه, or أَوَتَاه, or أَوَتَاهُ: see أَوِّ مِنْ
كَذَا.
أُوَّةٌ i. q. دَاهِيَةٌ [A calamity, a misfortune, &c.:
or, perhaps, very cunning, applied to a man]: pl.
أُوَوْ; (AA, T, K, TA; [but in copies of the K,
written أُوَوٌ;]) which is one of the strangest of the
things transmitted from the Arabs; the regular
form being أُوَّى, like قُوَّي, pl. of قُوَةٌ; but the word
occurring as above in the saying of the Arabs,
مَا هُوَ إِلَّا أُوَّةٌ مِنَ الأُوَوْ [It is no other thing than a
calamity of the calamities: or, perhaps, he is no
other than a very cunning man of the very cunning]. (AA, T, TA.)
آوِ and آوٍ: see أَوِّ: and see آهِ in art. اوه.
أَوَوِىٌّ and آوِىٌّ: see آيَةٌ, in art. اى.
آوَّتَاه: see أَوِّ.
