اف1
أَفَّ, aor. يَؤُفٌّ (IDrd, M, Mgh, K,) and يَئِفُّ,
(IDrd, M, K,) the latter agreeable with analogy,
(TA,) [but the former, though irregular, is the
more common,] inf. n. أَفٌّ; (M, Mgh;) and
↓ أفّف, inf. n. تأْفِيفٌ; (S, Mgh, K;) and ↓ تأفّف;
(M, K;) He said أُفِّ [q. v.], (IDrd, S, M, Mgh,
K,) by reason of anxiety, or disquietude of mind,
or by reason of vexation, distress of mind, or
disgust: (IDrd, M, K:) held by Sb to be of the
same class as سَبَّحَ and هَلَّلَ meaning “ he said
سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ ” and “ he said لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا اللّٰهُ. ” (M.) You
say also, ↓ أَفَّفَهُ, and بِهِ ↓ أَفَّفَ, and بِهِ ↓ تَأَفَّفَ,
meaning He said to him أُفِّ. (M.) And جَعَلَ

say أُفِّ أُفِّ by reason of a smell which he perceived.
(T.) And عَلَيْهِ ↓ إِنَّهُ يَتَأَفَّفُ Verily he is angry

أُفٌّ Dirt, or filth; as also ↓ أُفَّةٌ: (S:) you say,
أُفَّا لَهُ, and ↓ أُفَّةً, Dirt, or filth, to him; in which
the tenween is for the purpose of rendering them
indeterminate; (S;) and أُفَّ لَهُ وَ تُفٌّ; (T;) and
وَتُفَّةً ↓ أُفَّةً; and أُفَّا وَتُفَّا; (T, S;) the latter of
which is an imitative sequent: (S:) or أُفٌّ signifies the dirt of the ear; and تُفٌّ, the dirt of the
nails; (As, T, M, K; but in the last, of the nail;)
the phrases mentioned above being used on the
occasion of deeming a thing dirty or filthy, and
afterwards on the occasion of experiencing annoyance or disgust at anything; (As, T, M,* TA;)
and ↓ أَفَفٌ, also, has the former of these two
meanings: (TA:) or أُفٌّ signifies the dirt around
the nail; (M;) or the dirt of the nail; (K;) and
تُفٌّ, the dirt in the nail: (M:) or the former, a
paring of the nail: and a piece of stick, or a
reed, which one takes up from the ground: (K:)
in these various senses they are explained as used
in the saying, أُفَّا لَهُ وَتُفَّا: (TA:) or the former
signifies stink: (Zj, TA:) or paucity; (T, M,
K) as also ↓ أَفَفٌ; (M;) or from ↓ أَفَفٌ signifying a thing little in quantity; (T; and the
same meaning is assigned to this word in the K;)
and تُفٌّ is an imitative sequent, (T, M, K,) of
the same meaning. (M.) ―
-b2-  أُفّ, also, is a word
expressive of vexation, distress of mind, or disgust;
(M, Mgh;) or of dislike, displeasure, or hatred;
(K;) and has six forms; (T, S;) mentioned by
Akh; (S;) or ten; (M;) or forty; (K;) or
more; (TA;) as follow: أُفِّ and أُفَّ and أُفُّ and
أُفٍّ and أُفَّا and أُفٌّ (T, S, M, K) and أُفِّ and أُفَ
and أُفُ and أُفٍ and أُفًا and أُفٌ (K) and أُفْ (M,
K) and أُفّْ and ↓ أُفَّى, pronounced with imáleh,
(M, K,) i. e. with pure imáleh, and ↓ أُفَّى with
intermediate imáleh, and ↓ أُفَّى without imáleh,
the alif [written ى] in these three denoting the
fem. gender, and ↓ أُفِّى, with kesr to the ف, (K,)
i. e., as a prefixed noun with its complement, [the
latter being the pronoun of the first pers.,] (TA,)
and ↓ أُفُّوْهْ, (K,) with damm to the أ and ف,
which latter is with teshdeed, and with the و and
ه quiescent, (TA,) and ↓ أُفَّةْ [in a copy of the M
↓ أُفَّةً] and ↓ أُفِهْ and ↓ أُفُّهْ (K) and ↓ إِفْ and ↓ إِفّْ
and ↓ إِفِ and ↓ إِفٍ and ↓ إِفًا and ↓ إِفٌ and ↓ إِفٍّ
and ↓ إِفًّ and ↓ إِفٌّ and ↓ إِفُّ, with damm to the
ف, which is with teshdeed, [in a copy of the M
↓ إِفَّ,] and ↓ إِفَّا, like إِنَّا, and ↓ إِفَّى, pronounced
with imáleh, and ↓ إِفِّى, with kesr, (K,) i. e.,
prefixed to the pronoun of the first person,
(IAmb,) and ↓ أَفْ and ↓ أَفِّ (K) and ↓ أَفٍّ or
↓ أَفٍ and ↓ آفِ, or ↓ آفِّ, and ↓ آفٍ, or ↓ آفٍّ,
(accord. to different copies of the K,) [all these
forms, making the number (forty) mentioned by
the author of the K, I have drawn from a comparison of three copies of that work, and I believe
them to be correct: some other forms are mentioned by SM as perhaps indicated in the K; but
I see no good reason for this: he then adds,] and
↓ أَفَهْ and ↓ أَفُوهْ and ↓ أَفَّهْ, the last mentioned by
IB on the authority of IKtt. (TA.) أُفِّ, [with
its variants,] in its primary sense, denotes one's
blowing at a thing that falls upon him, such as
dust or ashes; or at the place, to remove therefrom what is annoying; therefore people say, at
anything that they deem troublesome, or displeasing, or hateful, أُفِّ لَهُ [as though meaning
A puff, or blast of breath, to it]: (Kt, T:) or
[rather] it is a word imitative of a sound; [like
ugh in English, both in sound and meaning; and
in meaning like our interjections foh and faugh;]
(Bd on the ex. in the Kur which will be found
below, and TA;) denoting vexation, or distress
of mind, or disgust; (Bd ubi suprà) or denoting
contempt: (TA:) or it is a verbal noun, meaning
I am vexed, or distressed in mind, or disgusted:
(Bd ubi suprà:) or it is an imperative verbal
noun [denoting disgust or abhorrence, like out,
and away]: (IJ, M:) or he who says أُفَّا لَكَ uses
it in the manner of an imprecation, like as one
says وَيْلًا لِلْكَافِرِينَ; and he who says أُفٌّ لَكَ puts
it in the nom. case because of the ل, like as one
says وَيْلٌ لِلْكَافِرِينَ; and he who says أُفٍّ لَكَ puts
it in the gen. case likening it to words imitative
of sounds. (IAmb.) It is said in the Kur
[xvii. 24], وَلَا تَقُلْ لَهُمَا أُفِّ, (T, S, TA,) or أُفٍّ,
(TA, [in which other readings also are mentioned,]) [And say not thou to them (i. e. to thy
father and mother) Ugh, &c.,] meaning, do not
thou deem anything of their affairs burdensome,
nor be contracted in bosom thereby, nor be rough,
or harsh, or coarse, to them: (Kt, T:) or do not
thou say to them anything expressive of the least
disgust, when they have become old, but take
upon thyself their service; أُفِّ signifying stink.
