اكل1
أَكَلَهُ, [aor.
اَكُلَ,] inf. n. أَكْلٌ and مَأْكَلٌ, [He
ate it,] (S, K,) namely, food. (S.) Er-Rummánee says that أَكْلٌ properly signifies The
swallowing food after chewing it; so that the
swallowing of pebbles is not properly thus termed:
(Msb:) or, accord. to Ibn-El-Kemál, the conveying, or transmitting, to the belly what may be
chewed, whether [the thing be] chewed or not; so
that it does not apply to milk, nor to سَوِيق: and
as to the saying of the poet,
مِنَ الآكِلِينَ المَآءَ ظُلْمًا فَمَا أَرَى
يَنَالُونَ خَيْرًا بَعْدَ أَكْلِهِمُ المَآءَ
(assumed tropical:)  [Of the eaters of what they purchase with the
price of water, wrongfully, I do not see any attain
good after their eating of what they have purchased with the price of the water,] he means

with the price thereof what they would eat:
(TA:) [for you say, أَكَلَ كَذَا as meaning (assumed tropical:)  He
ate the price of such a thing: see another ex. voce
إِكَافٌ; and another voce ثَدْىٌ.] ―
-b2-  The saying,
in the Kur [v. 70], لَأَكَلُوا مِنْ فَوْقِهِمْ وَمِنْ تَحْتِ
أَرْجُلِهِمْ [They should eat things above them and
things beneath their feet] means, their means of
subsistence should be made ample; (Bd, TA;)
by the pouring of the blessings of the heaven and
the earth upon them; or by the abundance of the
fruit of the trees, and the produce of the grains
sown; or by their being blessed with gardens
of ripe fruits, so that they should gather them
from the upper part of each tree, and pick up
what should have fallen upon the ground. (Bd.)
―
-b3-  اِنْقَطَعَ أَكْلُهُ [lit. His eating became cut off,

does so in their absence: (TA:) and the action
thus signified may be [with words, or by making
signs] with the side of the mouth, and with the
eye, and with the head. (TA in art. همز.) It is
said in the Kur [xlix. 12], أَيُحِبُّ أَحَدُكُمْ أَنْ
يَأْكلَ لَحْمَ أَخِيهِ مَيْتًا [lit. Would any one of you
like to eat the flesh of his brother when dead?];

(K:) so the last is written accord. to the correct
copies of the K: accord. to Esh-Shiháb, in the

lexicologists: the same word, أَكِلَةٌ, is also explained in the K as signifying a disease in a limb,
or member, in consequence of which one part is
[as it were] eaten by another; [a meaning which
I believe to be correct, (see أُكَالٌ,) although SM
says,] but this is identical with the itch, or an
itching: and ↓ أَكَلَانٌ is a vulgar term for the
same; and so is ↓ آكِلَةٌ, with medd, given as
correct by Eth-Tha'álibee, in [his book entitled]
the Mudáf and Mensoob, but disallowed by ElKhafájee. (TA.) One says, إِنِّى لَأَجِدُ فِى جَسَدِى

where a similar meaning is assigned to the former
of these two words; and the same seems to be
indicated in the Msb.] ―
