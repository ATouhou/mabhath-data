اخذ1
أخَذَ, (S, A, L, &c.,) in the first pers. of

one writes أَخَذتُّ and the like,] aor.
اَخُذَ, imperative
خُذْ, originally اؤْخُذْ, (S, L,) which latter form

when the ا is pronounced with damm,] (TA,)
inf. n. أَخْذٌ (S, L, Msb, K, &c.) and تَأْخَاذٌ, (S,
L, K,) the latter having an intensive signification;
(MF;) and وَخَذَ is a dial. var., as mentioned
by Ibn-Umm-Kásim and others on the authority
of AHei; (MF in art. تخذ;) He took; he took
with his hand; he took hold of; (S, A, L, Msb,
K;) a thing. (S, L.) You say, خُذِ الخِطَامَ and
خُذْ بِالخِطَامَ Take thou, or take thou with thy

being redundant. (Msb.) [And أَخَذَ بِيَدِهِ, lit.

desired; as though he laid hold upon his hand,

-b6-  [He took and kept;] he

&c.) (assumed tropical:)  [It had an overpowering influence upon

L, B.) ―
-b10-  See also 2, in three places. ―
-b11-  He
gained the mastery over a person, and killed, or

[xl. 5], وَهَمَّتْ كُّلُ أُمَّةٍ بِرَسُولِهِمْ لِيَأْخُذُوهُ, meaning

or exterminated; and ↓ آخذ he punished, or chastised, without extirpating, or exterminating.
(MF.) [For ↓ آخذ,] some say وَاخَذَ, (S, L,)
which is not allowable, (K,) accord. to some; but
accord. to others, it is a chaste form; (MF;) of
the dial. of El-Yemen, and used by certain of the
seven readers [of the Kur-án] in the instance of
لَا يُوَاخِذُكُمُ اللّٰهُ [ii. 225 and v. 91]; and the

-b16-  He took to, set about,
began, or commenced; as in the saying, أَخَذَ يَفْعَلُ
كَذَا He took to, set about, began, or commenced,
doing such a thing; in which case, accord. to Sb,
اخذ is one of those verbs which do not admit of
one's putting the act. part. n. in the place of the
verb which is its enunciative: [i. e., one may not
say فَاعِلًا in the place of يفعل in the phrase above:]
and as in أَخَذَ فِى كَذَا He began, commenced, or
entered upon, such a thing. (L.) ―

↓ آخَذَتْهُ [of which the inf. n. is app. إِيخَاذٌ]. (L,
TA.) A woman says, أُؤَخِّذُ جَمَلِى I captivate,
or fascinate, my husband, by a kind of enchantment, or charm, and withhold him from other
women. (L, from a trad.) And one says, of a
man, يُؤَخِّذُ عَنِ امْرَأَتِهِ He withholds others [by a

captivated hearts in a manner peculiar to it]:
(K in art. حصر: [in the CK, incorrectly, اَخَذَت
and القُلُوبُ:]) and اخذ بِقَلْبِهِ [He, or it, captivated his heart; or] he [or it] pleased him, or

ائتخذ [written with the disjunctive alif
اِيتَخَذَ] occurs in its original form; and is changed
into اتَّخَذَ [with the disjunctive alif اِتَّخَذَ]; this
being of the measure افتعل from أَخْذُ, the [radical]
ء being softened, and changed into ت, and incorporated [into the augmentative ت]: hence, when
it had come to be much used in the form of افتعل
[thus changed], they imagined the [former] ت to
be a radical letter [unchanged], and formed from
it a verb of the measure فَعِلَ, aor. يَفْعَلُ; saying,
تَخِذَ, aor. يَتْخَذُ, (S, L, Msb, *) inf. n. تَخَذٌ and
تَخْذٌ: (Msb:) and ↓ اسْتَخَذَ [written with the disjunctive alif اِسْتَخَذَ], of which exs. will be found
below, is also used for اتّخذ; one of the two ت s
being changed into س, like as س is changed into
ت in سِتٌّ [for سِدْسٌ]: or استخذ may be of the
measure استفعل from تَخِذَ; one of the two ت s
being suppressed; after the manner of those who
say ظَلْتُ for ظَلِلْتُ: (S, L:) and IAth says
that اتّخذ, in like manner, is of the measure افتعل
from تَخِذَ; not from أَخَذَ: (L and K in art.
تخذ:) but IAth is not one who should contradict
J, whose opinion on this point is corroborated
by the fact that they say اتَّزَرَ from إِزَارٌ, and اتَّمَنَ
from أَمْنٌ, and اتَّهَلَ from أَهْلٌ; and there are
other instances of the same kind: or, accord. to
some, اتّخذ is from وَخَذَ, a dial. var. of أَخَذَ,
and is originally اِوْتَخَذَ. (MF.) [The various
significations of اتّخذ and تَخِذَ and استخذ will
be here given under one head.] ―
-b2-  You say,
إِئْتَخَذُوا فِى القِتَالِ, (S, L, K, *) and فى الحَرْبِ,
(Msb,) with two hemzehs, (S, L, K,) or, correctly,
إِيتَخَذُوا, with one hemzeh, [or اِيتَخَذُوا,] as two
hemzehs cannot occur together in one word,
(marginal note in a copy of the S,) [but in a
case of wasl, the first hemzeh being suppressed,
the second remains unchanged,] They took, or
seized, (أَخَذُوا,) one another (S, L, Msb, K) in
fight, (S, L,) and in war; (Msb;) and so
اِتَّخَذُوا. (Msb.) And اِيتَخَذَ القَوْمُ The people,
of company of men, wrestled together, each taking
hold in some manner upon him who wrestled with
him, to throw him down. (L, TA.) ―
-b3-  [اتّخذ,
as also ↓ استخذ, and] تَخِذَ, aor.
اَخَذَ, (K in art.
تخذ,) inf. n. تَخَذَ and تَخْذٌ, (TA in art. تخذ,)
likewise signifies i. q. أَخَذَ, (K in art. تخذ, and
B and TA in the present art.,) as meaning He
took a thing to, or for, himself; took possession
of it; got, or acquired, it; syn. حَازَ and حَصَّلَ.
(B, TA.) Some read, [in the Kur, xviii. 76,]
لَتَخِذْتَ عَلَيْهِ أَجْراً [Thou mightest assuredly have
taken for thyself a recompense for it]: (S, L, K
in art. تخذ, and TA in the present art.:) this
is the reading of Mujáhid, (Fr, TA,) and is
authorized by I'Ab, and is that of Aboo-'Amr
Ibn-El-'Alà and AZ, and so it is written in the
model-copy of the Kur, and so the readers [in
general] read: (AM, L, TA:) so read Ibn-Ketheer
and the Basrees; he and Yaakoob and Hafs
pronouncing the ذ; the others incorporating it
[into the ت]: (Bd:) some read لااتَّخَذتَّ; (L
and K in art. تخذ;) but these read at variance
with the scripture. (AM, L, TA.) أَرْضاً ↓ استخذ
is a phrase mentioned by Mbr as used by some
of the Arabs, (S, L,) and signifies i. q. اِتَّخَذَهَا
[He took for himself a piece of land]. (S, L, K.)
And اتّخذ وَلَدَّا [in the Kur, ii. 110, &c.,] signifies
He got a son, or offspring. (Bd &c. See also
below.) And تَخِذَ, aor.
اَخَذَ, inf. n. تَخَذٌ and تَخْذٌ,
also signifies He gained, acquired, or earned,
wealth, (L, and Msb in arts. اخذ and تخذ,) or
a thing. (Msb.) ―
-b4-  عَلَيْهِمْ يَدًا ↓ استخذ and عِنْدَهُمْ
signify alike, i. q. اتّخذ [He did to them a
benefit, or favour; as though he earned one
for himself in prospect, making it to be incumbent on them as a debt to him]: (ISh:) and
اِتَّخَذْتُ عِنْدَهُ مَعْروفًا means [in like manner,
as also عنده معروفا ↓ أَخَذْتُ, and يَدَّا, (and اِتَّخَذَ
فِيهِ حُسْناً has a similar meaning; see Kur xviii.
85;)] I did to him a benefit, or favour; syn.
أَسْدَيْتُهُ إِلَيْهِ. (Msb in art. سدي.) ―
-b5-  اتّخذ also
signifies He made a thing; syn. عَمِلَ; like تَخِذَ,
[aor.
اَخَذَ,] inf. n. تَخَذٌ and تَخْذٌ: (L:) he made, or
manufactured, a bow, a water-skin, &c., مِنْ كَذَا
of such a thing: he made, or prepared, a dish
of food, a medicine, &c.: either absolutely or
for himself. (The Lexicons passim.) ―
-b6-  Also
He made, or constituted, or appointed; syn.
جَعَلَ; doubly trans.; (B, Msb;) and so تَخِذَ.
(Msb in art. تخذ.) You say, اتّخذهُ صَدِيقًا He
made him [or took him as] a friend; (Msb in
the present art.;) and so تَخِذَهُ. (Idem in art.
تخذ.) And اتّخذهُ هُزُؤًا [in the Kur ii. 63 and
231, &c.,] means He made him, or it, a subject
of derision. (Bd, Jel.) And اتّخذهُ وَلَدًا [in
the same, xii. 21 and xxviii. 8,] He made him,
or took or adopted him as, a son. (Bd. See
also above.)

اسْتَخَذَ, written with the disjunctive alif

↓ إِخْذُهُمْ, and مَنْ أَخَذَ أَخْذُهُمْ [in the CK
اَخْذُهُمْ] and ↓ إِخْذُهُمْ, signify [virtually] the
same: (K:) or مَنْ أَخَذَهُ أَخْذُهُمْ and ↓ إِخْذُهُمْ
signify [properly] مَنْ أَخَذَهُ أَخْذُهُمْ وَسِيرَتُهُمْ [those
whom their way of life took, or influenced]. (ISk,
S L.) One says also, اسْتُعْمِلَ فُلَانٌ عَلَ الشَّامِ
↓ وَمَا أَخَذَ إِخْذَهُ, with kesr, meaning (assumed tropical:)  [Such a
one was appointed prefect over Syria,] and he
did not take to that good way of life which it was
incumbent on him to adopt: you should not say
أَخْذَهُ: (AA, S, L:) or it means and what was
adjacent to it: (Fr, L:) or, accord. to the Wá'ee,
one says, in this case, ↓ وَمَا أَخَذَ إِخْذَهُ and أَخْذُهُ
and ↓ أُخْذُهُ, with kesr and fet-h and damm [to the
hemzeh, and with the ذ marfooah, as in instances
before]. (Et-Tedmuree, MF.) One also says,
↓ لَوْ كُنْتَ مِنَّا لَأَخَذتَّ بِإخْذِنَا, (S, L,) with kesr to
the ا, (L,) [in a copy of the S بِأَخْذِنَا, which

Temeem,] meaning Wert thou of us, then thou
hadst taken to, or wouldst take to, our manners,

فَلَوْ كُنْتُمْ مُنَّا أَخَذْنَا بِإِخْذِكُمْ
IAar explains as meaning And were ye of us, we
had caught and restored to you your camels: but
no other says so. (L.) ―
-b3-  نُجُومُ الأَخْذِ The Mansions of the Moon; (S, L, K;) also called نُجُومُ
الأَنْوَآءٌ; (L; [see art. نوء;]) called by the former
appellation because the moon every night enters
(يَأْخُذُ فِى) one of those mansions: (S, L:) or the
stars which are cast at those [devils] who listen by
stealth [to the conversations of the angels]: (L, K:)
but the former explanation is the more correct.
