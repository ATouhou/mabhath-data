be a people beyond the Deylem; and on the
authority of Az, to be believers in a plurality of
gods; (the Geli and Gelœ of Ptolemy and Strabo,
as observed by Sale, in a note on ch. xviii. v. 93
of the Kur, on the authority of Golius in Alfrag.
p. 207;)]: (Bd in xviii. 93:) [said by the Arabs
to be Scythians of the furthest East; particularly
those on the north of the Chinese: (Golius:) or,
as some say, the descendants of Japheth, and all
the nations inhabiting the north of Asia and of
Europe: (Freytag:)] said in a rad., (TA,) on
the authority of I' Ab, (Msb,) to compose nine
tenths of mankind: (Msb, TA:) or يأجوج is the
name of the males, and مأجوج is that of the
females: (Msb:) he who pronounces them thus,
and makes the أ a radical letter, says that the
former is of the measure يَفْعُولُ, and the latter of
the measure مَفْعُولُ; as though from أَجَيجُ النَّارِ;
(Akh, S, Msb; *) or from مَآءٌ أُجَاجٌ; (TA;) or
from أَجَّ said of an ostrich; and imperfectly decl.
as being determinate and fem.: (Bd ubi suprà:)
he who pronounces them without ء, making the ا
in each an augmentative letter, says that the former
is from يَجَجْتُ, and the latter from مَجَجْتُ:
(Akh, S, K:) this is the case if they be Arabic:
(TA:) but some say that they are foreign names;
(Msb, TA;) their being imperfectly decl. is said
to indicate this; (Bd ubi suprà;) and if so, the ا
in them is similar to that in هَارُوت and مَارُوت and
دَاوُود and the like; and the ء, anomalous, as that
in عَأْلِمٌ and the like; and their measure is فَاعُولُ.
(Msb.) Ru-beh used to read ↓ آجُوجُ and مَاجُوجُ
[in the CK مأجُوج]; and Aboo-Mo'ádh, يَمْجُوجُ.
