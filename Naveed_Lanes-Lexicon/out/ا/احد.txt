احد2
أحّدهُ, [inf. n. تَأْحِيدٌ,] He made it one; or
called it one: as also وحّدهُ. (TA in art. وحد.)
You say, أَحِّدِ الِاثْنَيْنِ Make thou the two to become one. (K.) It is related in a trad., that
Mohammad said to a man who was making a
sign with his two fore fingers in repeating the
testimony of the faith, [There is no deity but God,
&c.,] أَحِّدْأَحِّدْ [meaning that he should make the
sign with one finger only]. (S.) And أَحَدَّ اللّٰهَ
means He declared God to be one; he declared,
or professed, the unity of God; as also وحّدهُ.
(T and L in art. وحد.) ―
-b2-  أَحِّدِ العَشَرَةَ, (S, K,)
inf. n. تَأْحِيدٌ, (K,) Make thou the ten to become
eleven, (S, K,) is a phrase mentioned by Fr on
the authority of an Arab of the desert. (S.)

اِتَّحَدَ: see art. وحد: and see what here
next follows.
10
استأحد He (a man, S) was, or became,
alone, by himself, apart from others, or solitary;
syn. اِنْفَرَدَ; (S, K;) as also ↓ اتَّحَدَ [written with
the disjunctive alif اِتَّحَدَ, originally اِئْتَحَدَ or
اِوتَحَدَ], (K, TA,) or تَوَحَّدَ. (CK.)
-A2-  مَا اسْتَأْحَدَ بِهِ
He did not know it; did not know, or had not
knowledge, of it; did not understand it; did not
know the minute circumstances of it; or did not
perceive it by any of the senses; syn. لَمْ يَشْعُرْ بِهِ;
(L, K;) i. e., a thing, or an affair: of the dial. of
El-Yemen. (L.)
أَحَدٌ, originally وَحَدٌ, the و being changed into أ,
(Msb,) One; the first of the numbers; (S;) syn.
[in many cases] with وَاحِدٌ; (S, Msb, K;) with
which it is interchangeable in two cases, to be
explained below: (Msb:) pl. آحَادٌ and أٌحْدَانٌ
(K) and أَحَدُونَ, which last occurs in a phrase
hereafter to be mentioned; (TA;) or it has no
pl. in this sense; (Msb, K, * TA;) and as to
آحَادٌ, it may be pl. of وَاحِدٌ, [and originally أَوْحَادٌ,]
like أَشْهَادٌ as pl. of شَاهِدٌ, (Th, Msb,) a pl. of
pauc. (Msb.) The fem. is ↓ إِحْدَى only; and
this is only used in particular cases, to be shown
below: (Msb:) most agree that the ى in this
word is the characteristic of the fem. gender: but
some say that it is to render it quasi-coordinate to
the quadriliteral-radical class: [this, however, is
inconsistent with its pronunciation, which is invariably إِحْدَى, not إِحْدَّى:] (TA:) its pl. is
إِحَدٌ, as though the sing. were إِحْدَةٌ, like as is
said of ذِكَرٌ as pl. of ذِكْرَى: one of the expositors
of the Tes-heel writes it أُحَدٌ, with damm and then
fet-h; but a pl. of this measure is not applicable
to a sing. of the measure فِعْلَى, with kesr. (MF.)
The dim. of أَحَدٌ is ↓ أُحَيْدٌ; and that of إِحْدَى is
↓ أُحَيْدَى. (L in art. وحد.) ―
-b2-  It is interchangeable with وَاحِدٌ in two cases: first, when it is
used as an epithet applied to God: (Msb:) for
الأَحَدُ, as an epithet, is applied to God alone,
(Msb, K,) and signifies The One; the Sole; He
who has ever been one and alone: or the Indivisible: or He who has no second [to share] in his
lordship, nor in his essence, nor in his attributes:
(TA:) you say, هُوَ الوَاحِدُ and هُوَ الأَحَدُ: and in
like manner, أَحَدٌ, without the article, is used as
an epithet specially in relation to God, and is
interchangeable in this case [but not in other
cases] with وَاحِدٌ: therefore you do not say
رَجُلٌ أَحَدٌ nor دِرْهَمٌ أَحَدٌ and the like [but رَجُلٌ
وَاحدٌ and دِرهَمٌ وَاحِدٌ &c.] (Msb.) [See also
وَاحِدٌ, in art. وحد.] In the phrase in the Kur
[cxii. 1], قُلْ هُوَ اللّٰهُ أَحَدٌ [Say, He is God, One
God], أَحَدٌ is a substitute for اللّٰهُ; for an indeterminate noun is sometimes a substitute for a
determinate noun, as in another passage in the
Kur, xcvi. 15 and 16. (S.) Secondly, it is interchangeable with وَاحِدٌ in certain nouns of number:
(Msb:) you say أَحَدَ عَشَرَ [masc.] and إِحْدَى عَشْرَةَ
[fem.] (S) [meaning Eleven: and in these two
cases you may not substitute وَاحِدٌ and وَاحِدَةٌ for
أَحَدٌ and إِحْدَى: but] in أَحَدٌوعَشْرُونَ [One and
twenty, and the like,] أَحَدٌ is interchangeable with
وَاحِدٌ. (Msb.) Ks says, When you prefix the
article ال to a number, prefix it to every number;
therefore you should say, مَا فَعَلَتِ الأَحَدَ العَشَرَ
الأَلْفَ الدِّرْهَمَ [What did the eleven thousand
dirhems?]: but the Basrees prefix it to the first
only, and say, ما فعلت الأَحَدَ عَشَرَ أَلْفَ دِرْهَمٍ. (S.)
―
-b3-  In [most] cases differing from these two, there
is a difference in usage between أَحَدٌ and وَاحِدٌ:
the former is used in affirmative phrases as a prefixed noun only, governing the noun which follows it in the gen. case; [as in exs. which will be
found below;] and is used absolutely in negative
phrases; [as will also be seen in exs. below;]
whereas وَاحِدٌ is used in affirmative phrases as a
prefixed noun and otherwise: the fem. إِحْدَى,
also, is only used as a prefixed noun, except in
numbers (Msb) [and in one other instance, which
see below]. Using أَحَدٌ and its fem. in affirmative
phrases as prefixed nouns, you say, قَامَ أَحَدُ الثَّلَاثَةِ
[One of the three stood]; and قَالَتْ إِحْدَا هُمَا [One
of them two (females) said]; and خُذْ إِحْدَى
الثَّلَاثَةِ [Take thou one of the three]. (TA.) The
phrase إِحْدَى بَنَاتِ طَبَقٍ means A calamity:
(K:) or, as some say, (TA, but in the K “ and,”)
a serpent; (K, TA;) so called because it twists
itself round so as to become like a طَبَق. (TA.)
And the phrase إِحْدَى الإِحَدِ, (L, K, TA,) in
which the latter word has kesr to the إ and fet-h
to the ح, and is pl. of the former, also written
الأُحَدِ, but this form is disapproved by MF, as
has been shown above, (TA, [in several copies
of the K incorrectly written الأَحَدِ,]) [lit. means
One of the ones; and] is applied to a great, or
mighty, event; (L, K, TA;) one that is difficult,
distressing, grievous, or terrible. (L, TA.) You
say, أَتَى بِإِحْدَى الإِحَدِ [the last of which words
is here again written in several copies of the K
الأَحَدِ] He brought to pass a grievous, and great,
or mighty, event, (K, TA,) when you desire to
express the greatness and terribleness of an event.
(TA.) You also say, فُلَانُ أَحَدُ الأَحَدِينَ, and
وَاحِدُ الأَحَدِينَ, (K, TA,) the latter in one copy
of the K written وَاحِدُ الوَاحِدِينَ, in which the
latter word is pl. of the former, (TA,) and وَاحِدُ
الآحَادِ, and إِحْدَى الإِحَدِ, (K, TA,) like a phrase
before mentioned, only the former is applied to a
calamity, and this to an intelligent being, and
written in the two manners before mentioned, the
difference being only in application, (TA, [in
several copies of the K here again written إِحْدَى
الأَحَدِ, and in the CK اَحَدِىُّ الاَحَدِ,]) and إِحْدَى
الأَحَدِينَ, (Et-Tes-heel,) and إِحْدَى الآحَادِ, (TA,)
which are expressions of the utmost praise, (IAar,
A Heyth, K,) [lit. Such a man is one of the ones;
meaning] such a one is unique among the uniques;
(TA;) one who has no equal; unequalled; incomparable. (IAar, Tes-heel.) It seems that the
form of pl. used in the phrase أَحَدُ الأَحَدِينَ is
used only as applied to rational beings; but it is
said in the Expositions of the Tes-heel that this
phrase signifies One of the calamities; the form
of the rational pl. being given to nouns significant
of things deemed great, mighty, or grievous.
(AHeyth.) In the phrase إِحْدَى الإِحَدِ, the fem.
forms are said to be used for the purpose of giving
intensiveness to the signification, as though the
meaning were دَاهِيَةُ الدَّوَاهِى, the word داهية being
[an intensive epithet] from دَهَآءٌ as signifying
intelligence, or intelligence mixed with craft or
cunning and forecast; or by داهية being meant a
calamity. (Expositions of the Fs, TA.) AHei
thought أَحَدُ الأَحَدِينَ to be an epithet applied to
a male, and إِحْدَى الإِحَدِ to be applied to a
female: but his opinion has been refuted by EdDemámeenee in the Expos. of the Tes-heel: and
this latter author there remarks, that in expressions
meant to denote praise [of a man], أَحَدٌ and
إِحْدَى are prefixed to their own proper pls., as
أَحَدُونَ and إِحَدٌ; or to an epithet, as in the case
of أَحَدُ العُلَمَآءِ [One of the learned]; but that they
have not been heard prefixed to generic nouns.
(TA.) You say likewise, هُوَ ابْنُ إِحْدَاهَا He is
born of noble, or generous, ancestors, both on the
father's and the mother's side; speaking of a
man and of a camel. (L and K in art. وحد.) And
لَا يَقُومُ بِهٰذَا الأَمْرِ إِلَّا ابْنُ إِحْدَاهَا None will manage
this thing, or affair, but a noble, or generous,
man. (AZ, L in art. وحد.) And ↓ لَا يَسْتَطِيعُهَا
ابْنُ إِحْداتِهَا [None will be able to perform it but
a noble, or generous, man]. (L in art. وحد.) ―
-b4-
One instance is mentioned, of the occurrence, in
a trad., of إِحْدَى not used as a part of a number
[i. e. not as a part of the compound إِحْدَى عَشْرَةَ]
nor as a prefixed noun; viz., إِحْدَى مِنْ سَبْعٍ
[One of seven]; in which سبع is said to mean the
nights of 'Ád [during which that tribe was destroyed], or the years of Joseph [during which
Egypt was afflicted with dearth]. (MF, from the
Fáïk &c.) ―
-b5-  Used in a negative phrase, أَحَدٌ
signifies Any one with whom one may talk or
speak: and in this manner it is used without
variation as sing. and pl. and fem. (S) as well as
masc. (Msb.) You say, لَا أَحَدَ فِي الدَّارِ [There
is not any one in the house]: but you do not say,
فِيهَا أَحَدٌ [as meaning the contrary]. (S.) We
read in the Kur [lxix. 47, this ex. of its use as a
masc. pl.], فَمَا مِنْكُمْ مِنْ أَحَدٍ عَنْهُ حَاجِزِينَ [And
not any persons of you should have withheld me
from punishing him]. (S.) And in the same
[xxxiii. 32, we find this ex. of its use as a fem.
pl.], لَسْتُنَّ كَأَحَدٍ مِنَ النِّسَآءِ [Ye are not like any
others of women]. (S.) ―
-b6-  It is also used in
interrogative phrases; as in the saying, هَلْ أَحَدٌ
رَأَي مِثْلَ هٰذَا [Has any one seen the like of this?];
(A'Obeyd, L;) and in the saying, يَا حَدْ رَآهَا [for
يَا أَحَدٌ, O, has any one seen her, or it?]. (L,
from a trad.) ―
-b7-  It is [said to be] also used in the
sense of شَىءٌ [meaning Anything], applied to an
irrational being; as in the saying, مَا بِا لدَّارِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ
إِلَّا حِمَارًا There is not in the house anything,
rational or irrational, except an ass: so that the
thing excepted is united in kind to that from
which the exception is made [accord. to this rendering; but this instance is generally regarded as
one in which the thing excepted is disunited in
kind from that from which the exception is made].
(Msb.) So too in the Kur lx. 11, accord. to the
reading of Ibn-Mes'ood: (Msb:) but others there
read شَىْءٌ, which may mean any one or any thing.
(Bd, Jel.) ―
-b8-  الأَحَدٌ, (K,) as also يَوْمَ الأَحَدِ, (S,
Msb,) as a proper name, (Msb,) is applied to
A certain day; (K;) [Sunday;] the first day of
the week; or, as some say, [i. e. as some term it,]
the second of the week; (TA;) for the Arabs are
said, by IAar, to have reckoned the Sabbath, or
Saturday, as the first, though they called Sunday
the first of the days: (Msb in art. جمع:) it is
sing., and masc.: (Lh:) pl. [as above, i. e.]
آحَادٌ (S, Msb, K) and أُحْدَانٌ: (K:) or it has no
pl. (K: [but in the TA this last observation is
very properly restricted, as relating only to أَحَدٌ
as syn. with وَاحِدٌ, and as applied to any unknown
person.]) In this sense, it has no dim. (Sb, in S,
art. امس.) ―
-b9-  الآحَادُ in lexicology signifies What
have been transmitted by some of the lexicologists,
but not by such a number of them as cannot be
supposed to have agreed to a falsehood: what has
been transmitted by this larger number is termed
مُتَوَاتِرُ. (Mz 3rd نوع.)
إِحْدَي: fems. of أَحَدٌ, q. v.
إِحْدَاةٌ: fems. of أَحَدٌ, q. v.
أَحَدِيَّةٌ The unity of God; (Msb;) as also
وَحْدَانِيَّةٌ. (L and K in art. وحد.)
أُحَادَ [accus. of أُحَادُ] is imperfectly decl., because of its deviation from its original, (S, K,)
both in form and in meaning; (S;) [being
changed in form from وَاحِدًا, and in meaning
from اوَاحِدًا: (see ثُلَاثَ:)] you
say, جَاؤُوا أُحَادَ أُحَادَ, [احاد being repeated for
the purpose of corroboration,] meaning, They
came one [and] one, one [and] one; or one [by] one,
one [by] one. (S, K.) The dim. of أُحَادُ is ↓ أُحَيِّدٌ,
perfectly decl., like ثُلَيِّثٌ [q. v.] &c. (S, in art.
ثلث.)
أُحَيْدٌ dim. of أَحَدٌ, q. v.
أُحَيِّدٌ: see أَحَادَ.
أُحَيْدَى dim. of إِحْدَى fem. of أَحَدٌ, q. v.
