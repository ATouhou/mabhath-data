آلَ, aor. يَؤُولُ, (T, S, M, &c.,) inf. n. أَوْلٌ
(T, M, Mgh, Msb, K) and مَآلٌ (M, K) and
إِيَالٌ, which last is used as a subst. in relation to
objects of the mind, (Msb,) and أَيْلُولَةٌ [like
دَيْمُومَةٌ], (TA,) He, or it, returned; syn. رَجَعَ;
(T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K;) and عَادَ; (T;) [and
he resorted; (see an instance voce إِيَّلٌ;)] إِلَيْهِ to
it; (M, K;) namely a thing [of any kind; the thing,
or place, whence he, or it, originated, or came; his,
or its, origin, or source; his, or its, original state,
condition, quantity, weight, &c.; any place; and
a former action, or saying, or the like: see رَجَعَ,
by which, as the explanation of آلَ, may be meant
to be implied some other significations, here following, which these two verbs have in common]:
(M:) and آلَ عَنْهُ he (a man, M) returned,
or reverted, from it. (M, K.) ―
-b2-  From آلَ as
syn. with رَجَعَ is the phrase, فُلَانٌ يَؤُولُ إِلَى كَرَمٍ
[meaning either Such a one returns to generosity,
or, as كَرَمٌ is used in the sense of كِرَامٌ, is
referable to generous, or noble, ancestors]. (TA.)
[And hence the phrase,] آلَ إِلَيْهِ بِنَسَبٍ [He bore
a relation to him, as a member to a head, by
kindred], and بِدِينٍ [by religion]. (Ibn-'Arafeh.)
And the saying, in a trad., مَنْ صَامَ الدَّهْرَ فَلَا
صَامَ وَ لَا آلَ, i. e. (tropical:)  [He who fasts ever, or always,
may he neither fast] nor return to what is good.
(TA.) [In the Mgh, art. دهر, for آل I find أَفْطَرَ;
and it is there said that this is an imprecation
uttered by the Prophet, lest a man should believe
this kind of fasting to be ordained by God; or,
through impotence, should become insincere; or
because, by fasting all the days of the year, he
would do so on the days on which fasting is
forbidden. See other readings voce أَلَا in art.
الو.]) ―
-b3-  Hence also the saying, آلتِ الضَّرْبَهُ إِلَى
النَّفْسِ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  The blow, or stroke, resulted
in destroying life; in slaying, or killing. (Mgh.)
―
-b4-  Hence also, آلَ الأَمْرُ إِلَى كَذَا [The affair,
or case, became ultimately reduced to such a state,
or condition; came to such a result; came to
be thus]. (Msb.) ―
-b5-  Hence also, طَبَخْتُ الشَّرَابَ
فَآلَ إِلَى قَدْرِ كَذَا I cooked the wine, or beverage,
and it became reduced (رَجَعَ) to such a quantity.
(S.) And طَبَخَهُ حَتَّى آلَ إِلَى الثُّلُثِ أَوِالرُّبعِ He
cooked it (namely نَبِيذ [i. e. must, or mead, or
wort,]) until it became reduced (رَجَعَ) to the
third, or to the fourth: (T:) or, said of the
same, (Mgh,) or of medicine, (TA,) حَتَّى آلَ
المَنَّانِ مَنَّا وَاحِدًا, (Mgh,) or إِلَى مَنٍّ وَاحِدٍ, (TA,)
until twice the quantity, or weight, of a مَنّ
became [reduced to] (صَارَ) one مَنّ. (Mgh.) ―
-b6-
[Hence also, مَجَازُ الأَوْلِ The proleptic, or anticipative, trope; as فَصِيلٌ applied to “a young
camel” before it is weaned, because it is to be
weaned.] ―
-b7-  [And hence also, app.,] آلَ الشَّىْءُ,
inf. n. مَآلٌ, The thing [became reduced in quantity or size;] decreased; diminished; or became
defective, or deficient. (M, K.) And آلَ لَحْمُ
النَّاقَةِ The flesh of the she-camel went away, so
that she became lean, or slender and lean, or lean
and lank in the belly. (T, K.) ―
-b8-  آلَ, (T, S, M,
K,) inf. n. أَوْلٌ (T, M, K) and إِيَالٌ, (M, K,)
is also said of tar, (T, S, M,) and of honey, (S,)
and of milk, (M,) and of wine, or beverage,
(TA,) and of urine, (M,) or of the urine of
camels that have been contented with green pasture instead of water, at the end of their being in
that state, (T,) and of oil, (M, K,) and other things,
(K,) as meaning It became thick: (T, S, M, K:)
said of milk, it thickened and coagulated: (M:)
said of wine, or beverage, it thickened, and
became intoxicating in its utmost degree: (Az,
TA:) and said of oil, it attained its full perfume,
or sweetness of odour, by being well prepared
or compounded. (T.) ―
-b9-  مَا لَكَ تَؤُولُ إِلَى كَتِفَيْكَ
[written in the TA without any vowel-signs, app.
meaning (tropical:)  What aileth thee that thou shruggest
thy shoulders? lit., drawest thyself together to
thy two shoulder-blades?] is said [to a man] إِذَا
انْضَمَّ إِلَيْهِمَا وَاجْتَمَعَ [when he draws himself together to them, and contracts himself]; and is
a tropical phrase: so says Z. (TA.) ―
-b10-  آلَ مِنْ
فُلَانٍ He escaped, or became safe or secure, from
such a one: a dial. var. of وَأَلَ: (T, K:) of the
dial. of the Ansár. (TA.) ―
-b11-  You say also, آلَ,
aor. يَؤُولُ; (T, Msb;) or أَوِلَ, aor. يَأْوَلُ; (K;)
meaning He, or it, preceded; went before; was,
or became, before, beforehand, first, or foremost;
(T, Msb, K;) and came: (Msb:) with this, also,
وَأَلَ is syn.; and from it [says Az] is most probably derived أَوَّلُ, so that its original form is أَأْوَلُ:
[or, as Fei says,] hence is derived the phrase,
used by the vulgar, العَشْرُ الأَوَّلُ with fet-h to the
hemzeh [as meaning “the first, or preceding, ten
(nights of the month),” for الأُوَلُ, pl. of الأُولَى,
fem. of الأَوَّلُ; but this is generally regarded as
being originally الأَوْأَلُ, from وَأَلَ]. (Msb.)
-A2-
آلَهُ: see 2. ―
-b2-  Accord. to Lth, (TA,) أُلْتُهُ, (M,
K,) aor. أَؤُولُهُ, inf. n. أَوْلٌ, (TA,) signifies I
made it (namely, milk, M, or oil &c., K) to
thicken, (M, K,) and to coagulate; (M;) the
verb being both intrans. and trans.: (K:) but
Az says that it is not known as trans., in this
sense, in the language of the Arabs [of the classical ages]. (TA.)
-A3-  آلَ رَعِيّتَهُ, (S, M, Msb, K,)
aor. يُؤُولُ, inf. n. أَوْلٌ (S) and إِيَالٌ, (S, M, K,)
of which the simple subst. is إِيَالَةٌ, (S, * Msb,)
He (a prince or commander, S, or a king, M, K)
ruled, or governed, his subjects; presided over
their affairs, as commander or governor; (S, M,
Msb, K;) and did so well: (S:) and آلَ عَلَيْهِمْ,
inf. n. أَوْلٌ and إِيَالٌ and إِيَالَةٌ, [or this last, as
said above, is a simple subst.,] he presided over
them; held command, or authority, over them;
(M, K;) namely, a people, or company of men;
(K;) or, over their affairs. (TA.) It is said
in a prov., (M,) قَدْ أُلْنَا وَإِيلَ عَلَيْنَا (T, S, M) We
have ruled and been ruled; (T;) we have presided and been presided over. (M.) ―
-b2-  آلَ مَالهُ,
(T, S, M, * Msb, K,) inf. n. إِيَالَةٌ, (T, Msb,) He
put into a good, or right, state, or condition, and
managed, or tended, his مال [meaning cattle];
(T, S, M, * K;) as also ↓ ائتالهُ [written with the
disjunctive alif اِيتَالَهُ], (K,) inf. n. اِيتِيَالٌ: (S:)
or he managed his camels, and his sheep or goats,
in such a manner that they throve, or became
in a good state or condition, by his management.
(Msb.) Lebeed describes a female singer
إِبْهَامُهَا ↓ بِمُوَتَّرٍتَأْتَالُهُ
(T, S,) meaning with a stringed lute, (EM
p. 169,) which her thumb adjusts; (S, EM;)
from أُلْتُ, (T, S,) signifying I put into a good,
right, or proper, state, or condition. (T. [But
see another reading in the first paragraph of art.
اوي.]) You say also, أُلْتُ الشَّىْءَ meaning I composed, or collected together, the thing, and put
it into a good, right, or proper, state, or condition: and some of the Arabs say, اللّٰهُ عَلَيْكَ ↓ أَوَّلَ
أَمْرَكَ, i. e. May God compose for thee thine
affair: and, by way of imprecation, اللّٰهُ ↓ لَا أَوَّلَ
عَلَيْهِ شَمْلَهُ [May God not compose for him his
discomposed, disorganized, deranged, or unsettled,
affair, or affairs]. (T.) ―
-b3-  أُلْتُ الإِبلَ, inf. n.
أَوْلٌ and إِيَالٌ, also signifies I drove the camels:
(M:) or, accord. to the T, I bound the camels'
udders with the أَصِرَّة (صَرَرْتُهَا) until the time of
milking, when I loosed them. (TA.)
2
أوّلهُ إِلَيْهِ, (M, K,) inf. n. تَأْوِيلٌ, (TA,) He
returned it (namely, a thing, M) to him, or it;
he made it, or caused it, to return to him, or it;
syn. رَجَعَهُ: (M, K: in the CK رَجَّعَهُ:) and ↓ آلَهُ
also signifies the same; syn. رَدَّهُ. (TA.) You
say, أَوَّلَ اللّٰهُ عَلَيْكَ ضَالَّتَكَ May God restore to
thee thy stray; (T, * TA;) cause it to return to
thee; (TA;) bring together thee and it. (T.)
And أَوَّلْتُهُ إِلَى كَذَا I caused him, or it, to come
to such a state or condition; brought, or reduced,
him, or it, thereto; syn. صَيَّرْتُهُ إِلَيْهِ. (T.) ―
-b2-  See
also 1, near the end of the paragraph, in two
places. ―
-b3-  تَأْوِيلٌ also signifies The discovering,
detecting, revealing, developing, or disclosing, or
the explaining, expounding, or interpreting, that
to which a thing is, or may be, reduced, or that
which it comes, or may come, to be: (S, O, TA:)
you say, أَوَّلْتُهُ, inf. n. تَأْوِيلٌ; and ↓ تَأَوَّلْتُهُ, inf. n.
تَأَوُّلٌ; in one and the same sense: and hence the
saying of El-Aashà:
حُبِّهَا ↓ عَلَى أَنَّهَا كَانَتْ تَأَوُّلُ
رِبْعِىِّ السِّقَابِ فَأَصْحَبَا ↓ تَأَوُّلَ
(S:) or حُبَّها ↓ تاوَّل: (so in a copy of the T: [the
former word being, accord. to this reading, a
contraction of تَتَأَوَّلُ; but this does not altogether
agree with what here follows:]) AO says, تَأَوُّلُ حُبِّهَا
means تَفْسِيرُهُ وَمَرْجِعُهُ: [i. e., the explanation of
her love, or of the (poet's) love of her, and the
state, or condition, to which it eventually came,
is this:] (S:) it was small in his heart, and
ceased not to grow until it became great; like as
the little young camel [born in the season called
ربيع, or in the beginning of the breeding-time,]
ceases not to grow until he becomes great like his
mother, (T, * S,) and has a son accompanying
him: (S:) [or] أوّلهُ and ↓ تأوّلهُ, (M, K,) inf. n.
of the former as above, (K,) when said of language, signify دَبَّرَهُ وَقَدَّرَهُ وَفَسَّرَهُ [he considered its
end, or what it might be to which it led or pointed,
and compared one part of it with another, and
then explained, or expounded, or interpreted, it]:
(M, K:) hence, [if the explanation in the M and
K be meant to denote three distinct meanings,
which I do not think to be the case,] it would
seem as though تَأْوِيلٌ and تَفْسِيرٌ were syn.; but
accord. to other authorities, they differ: (TA:)
[Az says,] accord. to Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà, these
two words and مَعْنًى are all one: but تأويل seems
to me to signify the collecting the meanings of
dubious expressions by such expression as is clear,
or plain, without dubiousness: or, accord. to Lth,
it is the interpreting of language that has different
meanings; and this cannot be rightly done but by
an explanation which changes the expression; as
also ↓ تأَوُّلٌ: (T:) or the turning a verse of the
Kur-án from its apparent meaning to a meaning
which it bears, or admits, when the latter is
agreeable with the Scripture and the Sunneh: for
instance, in the words of the Kur [vi. 95, &c.],
يُخْرِجُ الْحَىَّ مِنَ المَيِّتِ, if the meaning be [thus
explained] “He produceth the bird from the egg,”
this is تفسير: and if [it be explained as meaning]
“He produceth the believer from the unbeliever,”
or “the knowing from the ignorant,” this is
تأويل: so says Ibn-El-Kemál: (TA:) [hence,
although it may often be rendered by interpretation, like تفسير, it more properly signifies the
rendering in a manner not according to the letter,
or overt sense; explaining the covert, or virtual,
meaning; interpreting in a manner not according
to the obvious meaning:] or the reducing a thing
to its ultimate intent, whether it be a saying or
an action: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or تفسير signifies
the “discovering, detecting, revealing, or disclosing, what is meant by a dubious expression;”
and تأويل, the reducing one of two senses, or
interpretations, which an expression bears, or
admits, to that which suits the apparent meaning:
(L and K in art. فسر, and TA in that and in the
present art.:) or the former signifies the “expounding, explaining, or interpreting, the narratives which occur collected without discrimination
in the Kur-án, and making known the significations of the strange words or expressions, and
explaining the occasions on which the verses were
revealed;” and the latter, the explaining the
meaning of that which is مُتَشَابِهِ, [or what is
equivocal, or ambiguous,] i. e., what is not understood without repeated consideration. (TA: [in
which are some further explanations; but these
add nothing of importance.]) ―
-b4-  [Hence, أوّل لَفْظًا,
in grammar, He rendered a word, or an expression, or a phrase, in grammatical analysis, by
another word, or expression, or phrase.] ―
-b5-  And
[hence likewise,] تَأْوِيلٌ signifies also The interpretation, or explanation, of a dream; the telling the
final sequel, or result, thereof: (M, K:) as in
the Kur xii. 101. (M.) ―
-b6-  It is also used [as a
simple subst.] to signify The end, issue, result, or
final sequel, of a thing; syn. عَاقِبَةٌ; (Bd in iv. 62
and xvii. 37;) or ↓ مَآلٌ; (Jel in the same places;)
or مَرْجِعٌ, and مَصِيرٌ; as in the Kur [iii. 5], وَمَا
يعْلَمُ تَأْوِيلَهُ إِلَّا اللّٰهُ [But none knoweth the end,
&c., thereof, except God]: (A'Obeyd, T:) or
this phrase means, but none knoweth when will be
the resurrection, and to what the case will eventually come, (T, M,) when the hour shall arrive,
(TA,) except God: (T, M:) so says Aboo-Is-hák:
(T:) and in like manner, [in the Kur vii. 51,]
هَلْ يَنْظُرُونَ إِلَّا تَأْوِيلَهُ means Do they wait for
aught save the result to which their case will come
by the resurrection? (Aboo-Is-hák, T, M:) or,
the result to which it will come (Bd, Jel) in the
manifestation of its truth by the appearance of
the promises and threats of which it has told?
(Bd:) in like manner, also, the saying, تَقْوي اللّٰهِ
أَحْسَنُ تَأْوِيلًا means The fear of God is best in
respect of result; syn. عَاقِبَةً. (TA.)
5
تَاَوَّلَ see 2, in the former half of the paragraph,
in six places. ―
-b2-  تأوّل فِيهِ الخَيْرَ He discovered in
him the existence of good, or goodness, from its
outward signs: and he sought, or looked for,
good, or goodness, in him. (TA.) You say also,
تَأَوَّلْتُ فِى فُلَانٍ الأَجْرَ I sought, or looked for,
recompense in (or of or from) such a one. (T.)
8
إِاْتَوَلَ see 1, near the end of the paragraph, in two
places.
10
استآل الرُّؤْيَا He sought the interpretation of
the dream, by consideration. (TA in art. سوأ.)
آلٌ A man's أَهْل [or family]; (T, S, M, Msb,
K;) i. e. his relations: (Msb:) his عَشِيرَة [or
kinsfolk; or nearer, or nearest, relations by
descent from the same father or ancestor; &c.];
from أَوْلٌ as signifying رُجُوعٌ, because recourse is
had to them in all affairs: (Har p. 578:) and his
household; (S, TA;) the people of his house:
(Msb:) and his followers; (S, Msb, K;) including soldiers: (S, TA:) and his أَوْلِيَآء [i. e.
friends, and the like]: (K:) those who bear a
relation to him, as members to a head, (مَنْ آلَ إِلَيْهِ,)
by religion or persuasion or kindred; as in the
Kur iii. 9 and viii. 54 and 56 &c.: (Ibn-'Arafeh:)
[or in these and many other instances, it may be
rendered people:] but in general it is not used
save in relation to that in which is eminence, or
nobility; so that one does not say, آلُ الإِسْكَافِ,
like as one says أَهْلُهُ: (K:) and it is peculiarly
used as a prefix to the proper names of rational
beings; not to indeterminate nouns, nor to nouns
of places or of times; so that one says, آلُ فُلَانٍ;
but not آلُ رَجُلٍ, nor آلُ زَمَانِ كَذَا, nor آلُ مَوْضَعِ
كَذَا, like as one says, [أَهْلُ رَجُلٍ, and أَهْلُ زَمَانِ
كَذَا, and] أَهْلُ بَلَدِ كَذَا and مَوْضِعِ كَذَا: (TA:)
Ks disallows its being prefixed to a pronoun; so
that one should not say, آلُهُ, but أَهْلُهُ; but his
opinion in this matter is not correct: it is originally أَوَلٌ; the و being changed into ا, (M, *
Msb,) as in قَالَ [which is originally قَوَلَ]: so
say some: (Msb:) or it is originally أَهْلٌ, (T,
M, Msb, K,) then أَأْلٌ, and then آلٌ: (K:) so say
some, arguing thus from its having أُهَيْلٌ for its
dim.: (T, Msb:) but accord. to Ks, it assumes
the form ↓ أُوَيْلٌ as a dim.: (T:) or each of these
is its dim. (M, K.) By the آل of the Prophet
are meant, accord. to some persons, His followers,
whether relations or others: and his relations,
whether followers or not: (Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà,
T:) or, as some say, his family (أَهْلُهُ [q. v.]) and
his wives: [but it seems to be indicated that what
I have rendered “and his wives” is meant as an
explicative adjunct to اهله:] or, as some say, the
people of his religion: (Esh-Sháfi'ee, T:) being
himself asked who were his آل, he answered all
pious persons: (Anas, TA:) but in a trad. in
which it is said that the poor-rates are prohibited
to him and to his آل, by this is meant those to
whom was appropriated the fifth [of the spoils]
instead of the poor-rates; and these were the
genuine descendants of Háshim and El-Muttalib.
(Esh-Sháfi'ee, T.) ―
-b2-  يَا لَزَيْدٍ and يَالَ زَيْدٍ, accord.
to the Koofees, are contractions of يَا آلَ زَيْدٍ [O
family of Zeyd]. (Mughnee, on the letter ل;
and El-Ashmoonee on the Alfeeyeh of Ibn-Málik,
section الاستغاثة. [See the letter ل.]) ―
-b3-  [See
also إِيلَةٌ.]
-A2-  (tropical:)  I. q. شَخْصٌ [meaning The body,
or corporeal form or figure or substance, (of anything, as is said in the T,) which one sees from a
distance; or, in this case, often, though not always,
the person, or self]; (AA, T, S, M, K;) of a
man: a metaphorical application, from آلٌ as
signifying أَهْلٌ and عَشِيرَةٌ; because comprising
the members and the senses. (Har p. 578.) ―
-b2-
Sometimes, it is redundant, or pleonastic; [being
only used for the sake of metre in verse, or to
give more force to an expression;] as in the
following instance:
أُلَاقِى مِنْ تَذَكُّرِ آلِ لَيْلَى
كَمَا يَلْقَى السَّلِيمُ مِنَ العِدَادِ
[I experience, from remembrance of Leylà, or of
Leylà's person or self, the like of what the person
bitten or stung by a venomous reptile experiences
from the paroxysm of pain occasioned by the bits
or sting]. (TA.) [See also another ex., voce
جَأْبٌ; and another, voce مِزْمَارٌ.] ―
-b3-  [Like شَخْصٌ,
it seems to be sometimes applied to Any material
thing that is somewhat high, and conspicuous:
and hence, perhaps, the signification next following.] ―
-b4-  مَا أَشْرَفَ مِنَ البَعِيرِ [app. meaning The
overtopping, or higher, part, or parts, of the
camel]. (M, K.) ―
-b5-  A [tent of the kind called]
خَيْمَة. (M.) ―
-b6-  The poles of the خَيْمَة; (M, K;)
as also ↓ آلَةٌ; of which the pl. is آلاتٌ: (K:) or
↓ آلَةٌ is the sing. of آلٌ and آلَاتٌ, [or n. un. of the
former and pl. of the latter,] which signify the
pieces of wood (خَشَبَات) upon which the خيمة is
raised, or constructed: and hence Kutheiyir
likens the legs of his she-camel to four آلات of
the [wood of the tree called] طَلْح. (S.) ―
-b7-  The
pieces of wood (خَشَب, T, M, K) of خَيْم [or tents],
(M,) stripped [of the tent-cloths]. (T, TA.) ―
-b8-
Also, [app. because rising from the general surface of the ground,] The extremities and sides of
a mountain. (M, K. *)
-A3-  The سَرَاب [or mirage]:
(As, T, M, K:) or peculiarly applied to that which
is in the first part of the day, (K,) as though
raising figures seen from a distance (شُخُوص),
and making them to quiver: (TA:) or that
which one sees in the first part of the day, and in
the last part thereof, as though raising figures
seen from a distance (شخوص); not the same as
the سراب: (S:) or what resembles the سراب:
(Msb:) or, as some say, that which is in the
ضُحَى [or early part of the day when the sun is
yet low], like water between the sky and the earth,
[in appearance] raising figures seen from a distance (شخوص), and making them to quiver;
whereas the سراب is that which is at mid-day,
[apparently] cleaving to the ground, as though
it were running water: Th says, the آل is in the
first part of the day: (M:) As says that the آل
and the سراب are one: but others say that the
former is from the ضُحَى [see above] to the
declining of the sun from the meridian; whereas
the سراب is after the declining of the sun from the
meridian to the prayer of the عَصْر; and in favour
of their assertion they urge, that the former [in
appearance] raises everything so that it becomes
what is termed آل, i. e. شَخْص; for the آل of
everything is its شخص; and that the سراب [in
appearance] lowers every شخص in it so that it
becomes [as though it were] cleaving to the
ground, having no شخص: Yoo says, the Arabs
say that the آل is from the غُدْوَة [or period between the prayer of daybreak and sunrise] to the
time when the sun is very high, or near the meridian; then it is called سراب for the rest of the
day: ISk says, the آل is that which [in appearance] raises figures seen from a distance (شخوص),
and is in the ضُحَى [explained above]; and the
سراب is that which is upon the surface of the
ground, as though it were water, and is at midday: and this, I [namely Az] say, is what I have
found the Arabs in the desert to say: (T:) El-
Hareeree speaks of the glistening of the آل; app.
using this word in the sense of سراب; for it is the
latter that glistens; not the former: (Har p. 363:)
the word is masc. and fem. (Msb, K.) The
phrase يَرفَعُ الْآلَا, ending a verse (S, M) of En-Nábighah, (M, TA,) i. e. Edh-Dhubyánee, (TA,)
or El-Jaadee, (S,) [variously cited in the S and M
and TA,] is an instance of inversion; the meaning
being يَرْفَعُهُ الْآلُ [The آل raising it]: (S, TA:)
or the meaning is, making the آل conspicuous
more than it would otherwise be; the agent of
the verb being a prominent portion of a mountain,
which, being itself raised [in appearance] by the
آل, has the effect of doing this. (M.)

himself or for another: it is both sing. and pl.:

آلَةَ الدِّينِ فِى طَلَبِ الدُّنيَا [lit. He makes use of
the instrument of religion in seeking the goods of
the present world], (assumed tropical:)  science, or knowledge, is

يَوْمًا عَلَى آلَةٍ حَدْبَآءَ مَحْمُولُ
[Every son of a female, though his health, or
safety, long continue, is one day borne upon a
gibbous bier: for the bier of the Arabs of the
desert was generally composed of two poles connected by a net-work of cords upon which the
corpse lay depressed]: (S, M:) or, as some say,

إِيَالٌ The vessel, or receptacle, of thickening,

sentence.

إِيَّلٌ and ↓ أُيَّلٌ (T, S, Mgh, Msb, K, the first
and third and fourth in art. ايل) and ↓ أيِّلٌ, (T,
K,) the last on the authority of IAar, (TA,) but
A'Obeyd says that it is إِيَّلٌ, with kesr, (T,) and
this is the approved form, (TA,) The [animal
called] وَعْل: (K:) or the male وَعْل; (ISh, T,
S, Mgh, Msb;) i. e. the mountain-goat: (Msb:)
accord. to some, (S,) what is called in Persian
كَوَزْن; (S, Mgh;) by which word Sh explains
the word إِيَّلٌ: ISh says, it is the animal that is
very wide between the horns, and bulky, like
the domestic bull: (T:) [see بَقَرُ الوَحْشِ in art.
بقر:] and Lth says, it is called thus because it
resorts (يَؤُولُ) to the mountains: sometimes the
ى is changed into ج: the fem. is of the same
three forms with ة: (TA:) and the pl. is أَيَائِلُ
[like سَيَائِدُ pl. of سَيِّدٌ]. (Lth, T, Mgh, Msb.) ―

M, TA;) applied to the urine of camels that
have been contented with green pasture instead
of water, at the end of their being in that state;
(T;) or to milk, (S, M, TA,) and to oil, and
other things, such as tar, and honey, and wine,
or beverage: (TA:) pl. ↓ أُيَّلٌ: (S, M:) which
last word [in one copy of the M written إِيلٌ,
but this I think a mistranscription,] signifies also
the remains of thickening, or thick, milk; or,
as some say, the [seminal] water in the womb:
(M:) or this same word (أُيَّلٌ) has the last of
these significations; and also, [as a sing. epithet,]
the first of the meanings explained in this paragraph; as also آئِلٌ, applied to milk; (K;) or to
milk thickening, or thick, and mixed; not excessively thick, but in a somewhat good degree, and
changed in its flavour: (AHát, TA:) or it [app.
أُيَّلٌ, as in the TK,] signifies the vessel, or receptacle, thereof; (K;) [a meaning assigned in the
M to إِيَالٌ;] in which milk thickens: (TA:)
Sh says that ↓ إِيَّلٌ signifies the milk of the أَيَائِل
[pl. of إِيَّلٌ]; and so says AA: but AHeyth says
that this is absurd; and that the right word is
↓ أُيَّلٌ, having the signification first explained in
this paragraph, i. e. thickening, or thick, milk:
En-Nadr says that ↓ إِيَّلٌ signifies thick urine of
she-goats of the mountain; which, when drunk
by a woman, excites her venereal faculty: (T:)
or this last word is used to signify milk of an
إِيَّل, which is said to strengthen in the venereal
faculty, and to fatten, as Ibn-Habeeb asserts;
and ↓ أُيَّلٌ, which he affirms to be wrong, is a dial.
var. thereof; and it may also be a quasi-pl. n.
thereof: (M:) as a pl. [of آئِلٌ], applied to milk,

form, of an epithet not applied to an animal; and
as being regularly أُوَّلٌ. (IJ, M.)

above. (M, K, TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence, مَآلُهُ إِلَى كَذَا His,
or its, return, or course, or transition, is to such
a state or condition.]
-A2-  Also, [as a noun of place
&c.,] i. q. مَرْجِعٌ [as signifying A place, and
a state, or condition, to which a person, or thing,
returns; and, to which he, or it, ultimately, or
eventually, comes]. (TA, [where this is given as
a signification not mentioned in the K; so that
مرجع is not here used as an inf. n.: it is, moreover, a signification well known.]) See also 2,
last sentence. ―
-b2-  A refuge: applied in this sense
to God. (Har p. 361.)
هُوَ مُؤْتَالٌ لِقَوْمِهِ مُقْتَالٌ عَلَيْهِمْ He is ruler, or

Veracious: opposed to مُتَقَوِّلٌ. (Har p. 256.)
