الاأَلَا [in its primitive acceptation, being composed
of the interrogative hemzeh and the negative لا,]
denotes an interrogation respecting a negative,
as in the saying [of the poet],
أَلَا اصْطِبَارَ لِسَلْمَى أَمْ لَهَا جَلَدٌ
إِذَا أُلَاقِى الَّذِى لَاقَاهُ أَمْثَالِى
[Is there not any patience belonging to Selmà,
or has she hardiness, when I experience what
persons like me have experienced?]: (Mughnee,
K:) and when used in this manner, it is put
before a nominal proposition only, and governs
like the negative لا [when used without the
interrogative hemzeh]. (Mughnee.) ―
-b2-  It also
denotes a wish; as in the saying [of the poet],
أَلَا عُمْرَ وَلَّى مُسْتَطَاعٌ رُجُوعُهُ
فَيَرْأَبَ مَا أَثْأَتْ يَدُ الغَفَلَاتِ
[May there not be a life which has declined
whereof the returning is possible, so that it may
repair what the hand of negligences hath marred?];
for which reason يرأب is mansoob, because it is
the complement of a wish, coupled with فَ: and
used in this manner, also, it is put before a
nominal proposition only, [ولّى in the verse
above being a qualificative, like an epithet,] and
it governs like the negative لا [without the interrogative hemzeh], and has no enunciative
either expressed or understood. (Mughnee.) ―
-b3-
It also denotes reproof, or reproach, (T, Mughnee,
K,) and disapproval; as in the saying [of the
poet],
أَلَا ارْعِوَآءَ لِمَنْ وَلَتْ شَبِيْبَتُهُ
وَاذَنَتْ بِمَشِيبٍ بَعْدَهُ هَرَمُ
[Is there no self-restraint to him whose youth
hath declined, and announced hoariness, after
which is to follow decrepitude?]: (Mughnee,
K:) and used in this manner, also, it is put
before a nominal proposition only, and governs
as in the cases mentioned above, (Mughnee,) or
before a verb [also], which is always marfooa;
as in the phrase أَلَا تَنَدَّمَ عَلَى فِعَالِكَ [Dost not
thou repent of thine actions?] and أَلَا تَسْتَحْيِى
مِنْ جِيرَانِكَ [Art not thou ashamed for thyself,
or of thyself, with respect to thy neighbours?]
and أَلَا تَخَافُ رَبَّكَ [Dost not thou fear thy Lord?].
(T.) ―
-b4-  It also denotes عَرْضٌ, (T,) or العَرْضُ,
and التَّحْضِيضُ, both of which signify the asking,
or requiring, a thing; (Mughnee, K; *) but the
former means the doing so with gentleness;
(Mughnee, K;) and the latter, the doing so
with urgency: (Mughnee:) and when used in
this manner, [also,] it is said to be composed of
لا with the interrogative hemzeh; (TA;) and
is put before a verbal proposition only; (Mughnee;) as in the saying [in the Kur xxiv. 22],
أَلَا تُحِبُّونَ أَنْ يَغْفِرَ اللّٰهُ لَكُمْ [Do not ye, or wherefore do not ye, (see أَمَا,) like that God should
forgive you?] (Mughnee, K,) and [in the same,
ix. 13,] أَلَاتُقَاتِلُونَ قًوْمًا نَكَثُوا أَيْمَانَهُمْ [Will not
ye, or wherefore will not ye, fight a people who
have broken their oaths?]; (Mughnee;) or
before a mejzoom or marfooa aor., both of these
forms being mentioned on the authority of the
Arabs, as in أَلَا تَنْزِلْ تَأْكُلْ and أَلَا تَنْزِلُ تَأْكُلُ
[Wilt not thou, or wherefore wilt not thou, alight
and eat?]. (Ks, T.) ―
-b5-  It is also an inceptive
particle, (S, Mughnee, K,) of which those who
parse show the place but neglect the meaning,
(Mughnee,) used to give notice of something
about to be said, [like as Now, and why, (by
the former of which I think it is generally best
rendered when thus used,) are often employed
in our language, and like as
ἀλλὰ (which is
remarkable for its near agreement with it in
sound) is often used in Greek,] (S, Mughnee, K,)
and importing averment, because it is composed
of the interrogative hemzeh and the negative لا
which, when thus composed, have this import,
(Mughnee, K,) like أَلَمْ, and أَلَيْسَ, because the
interrogative particle resembles the particle of
negation, and the negation of a negation is an
affirmation, (Ham p. 589,) and like أَمَا before
an oath: (Z, Mughnee:) [it may therefore be
further rendered by our word surely;; for this
word (as Dr. Johnson says in his Dictionary)
"is often used rather to intend and strengthen
the meaning of the sentence, than with any
distinct and explicable meaning:"] or it signifies
حَقًّا [verily, or truly]: (M voce أَمَا:) it is put
before both the [kinds of] propositions, [the
nominal and the verbal;] (Mughnee;) as in
the saying [in the Kur ii. 12], أَلَا إِنَّهُمْ هُمُ السُّفَهَآءُ
[meaning Now surely it is they who are the
lightwitted], (Mughnee, K,) and [in the same,
xi. 11,] أَلَا يَوْمَ يَأْتِيهِمْ لَيْسَ مَصْرُوفًا عَنْهُمْ [meaning
Now surely, on the day of its coming to them,
it shall not be averted from them], (Mughnee,)
in which يَوْمَ يَأْتِيهِمْ appears to be the object
of government of مَصْرُوفًا, which is the enunciative of لَيْسَ whence it has been argued that,
as the object of government of the enunciative
of ليس precedes that verb, the enunciative itself
may precede it: (I 'Ak pp. 74 and 75:) [J says,]
you say, أَلَا إِنَّ زَيْدًا خَارِجٌ [Now surely Zeyd is
going forth], like as you say, إِعْلَمْ أَنَّ زَيْدًا خَارِجٌ
[Know thou that Zeyd is going forth]: (S:)
Ks says, أَلَا is used to give notice of what is
about to be said, and is followed by a command
and a prohibition and an enunciation, as in أَلَا قُمْ
[Now stand thou], and أَلَا لَا تَقُمْ [Now stand
not thou], and أَلَا إِنَّ زَيْدًا قَدْ قَامَ [Now surely
Zeyd has stood, or has just now stood]. (T.)
When it is put before the particle [يَا] used to
give notice of what is about to be said, it is
merely an inceptive, as in the saying. [of the
poet],
أَلَا يَا اسْلَمِى يَا دَارَ مَىَّ عَلَى البِلَى
[Now be thou free from evil, O abode of Meiyà,
during wear and tear]. (AAF, M.) ―
-b6-  Lth says,
sometimes أَلَا is immediately followed by another
لا; and he cites the following ex.:
فَقَامَ يَذُودُ النَّاسَ عَنَّا بِسَيْفِهِ
يَقُولُ أَلَا لَا مِنْ سَبِيلٍ إِلَى هِنْدِ
[Then he began to drive away the people from us,
saying, Now is there no way to Hind?]: and
one says to a man, "Did such and such things
happen?" and he answers, أَلَا لَا [Why no]:
he holds الا to be used to give notice of what
is about to be said, and لا to be a negative. (T.)
أُلَا and الأُلَا, and أُلَآءِ &c.: see art. الى.
أَلَّا is a particle denoting تَحْضِيض; (Msb in
art. حض, Mughnee, K;) i. e., when followed by
a future, exciting to an action, and seeking or
desiring or demanding the performance of it;
and when followed by a preterite, reproof for not
doing a thing; (Msb ubi suprà;) syn. with هَلَّا;
(T, TA;) and peculiar to enunciative verbal propositions, (Mughnee, K,) like the other particles
used for the same purpose. (Mughnee.) You
say, [أَلَّا تَفْعَلُ كَذَا Wherefore wilt not thou do
such a thing? and] أَلَّا . فَعَلْتَ كَذَا [Wherefore
didst not thou such a thing?] (T, TA,) meaning,
(TA,) or as though meaning, (T,) لِمَ لَمْ تَفْعَلْ كَذَا.
(T, TA.)
-A2-  It also means أَنْ لَا; the ن being
incorporated into the ل, which is written with
teshdeed: (T, TA:) in which case, it is not to be
confounded with the foregoing particle. (Mughnee.) You say, أَمَرْتُهُ أَلَّا يَفْعَلَ ذَاكَ [I commanded
him that he should not do that]; and you may
say, أَمَرْتُهُ أَنْ لَا يَفْعَلَ ذَاكَ: it occurs in the old
copies of the Kur written in the former manner
in some places, and in the latter manner in other
places. (T, TA.) In the saying in the Kur
[xxvii. 31], أَلَّا تَعْلُوا عَلَىَّ, [which may mean That
ye exalt not yourselves against me, or exalt ye not
yourselves against me,] it may be a compound of
أَنْ governing a mansoob aor. and the negative لَا,
or of the explicative أَنْ and the prohibitive لا.
(Mughnee.) [It often has لِ prefixed to it, forming
the compound لِئَلَّا, which signifies That, or in
order that,... not; and may frequently be
rendered by lest; as in the Kur ii. 145, لِئَلَّا يَكُونَ
لِلنَّاسِ عَلَيْكُمْ حُجَّةٌ That, or in order that, there
may not be, or lest there should be, to men,
against you, any allegation.]
إِلَّا, [regarded as a simple word,] not to be
confounded with the compound of the conditional
إِنْ and the negative لَا, (Mughnee at the end of
the article on this word,) is used in four manners.
(The same in the beginning of the art.) First,
(Mughnee,) it is used (as a particle, S, Msb,) to
denote exception; [meaning Except, save, or
saving; and sometimes but; and sometimes but
not; as will be seen below;] (T, S, Msb, Mughnee, K; [in which last it is mentioned in art. ال,
and again, as in the S, in the last division of
the work;]) and to denote exception, it is used
in five manners; after an affirmation, and a
negation, and a portion of a sentence devoid of
the mention of that from which the exception is
made, and when the thing excepted precedes that
from which the exception is made, and when these
two are disunited in kind, in which last case it
has the meaning of لٰكِنَّ [but when the sentence
is negative, and but not when the sentence is
affirmative]. (S, TA.) You say, قَامَ القَوْمُ إِلَّا زَيْدًا
[The people, or company of men, stood, except
Zeyd]; i. e., Zeyd was not included in the predicament of the people, or company of men:
(Msb:) and it is said in the Kur [ii. 250], (T,)
فَشَرِبُوا مِنْهُ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا مِنْهُمْ [And they drank of it,
except a few of them]: (T, Mughnee, K:) here
قليلا is governed in the accus. case by الّا, (Mughnee, K,) accord. to the most correct opinion:
(Mughnee:) accord. to Th, it is so because there
is no negation in the beginning of the sentence.
(T.) And it is also said in the Kur [iv. 69], (T,)
مَا فَعَلُوهُ إِلَّا قَلِيلٌ مِنْهُمْ [They had not done it, or
they would not do it, except a few of them]: (T,
Mughnee, K:) here قليل is in the nom. case as
being a partial substitute, (Mughnee, K,) accord.
to the Basrees, (Mughnee,) i. e., as being a
[partial] substitute for the [pronoun] و [in فعلوه],
for it may here be so without perversion of the
meaning, whereas it cannot be so without such
perversion when the sentence is affirmative:
(TA:) accord. to the Koofees, الّا is a conjunction,
like the conjunctive لَا: (Mughnee:) accord. to
Th, قليل is here in the nom. case because the
sentence commences with a negative: (T:) or in
a sentence [like this,] which is not affirmative, in
which the thing excepted is united in kind to that
from which the exception is made, accord. to the
opinion which is generally preferred and which
commonly obtains, the noun signifying the thing
excepted is a substitute for the noun signifying
that from which the exception is made; but it is
allowable to put it in the accus. case according to
the general rule respecting exception; so that one
says, مَا قَامَ أَحَدٌ إِلَّا زَيْدٌ and إِلَّا زَيْدًا [There stood
not any one, except Zeyd]: and the same is the
case in a prohibitive sentence; as in لَا يَقُمْ أَحَدٌ
إِلَّا زَيْدٌ and إِلَّا زَيْدًا [Let not any one stand, except
Zeyd]; and in an interrogative sentence; as in
هَلْ قَامَ أَحَدٌ إِلَّا زَيْدٌ and إِلَّا زَيْدًا [Did any one stand,
except Zeyd?]; when, in such sentences, the thing
excepted is united in kind to that from which the
exception is made. (I 'Ak p. 162.) You say also,
مَا جَآءَنِى إِلَّا زَيْدٌ [There came not to me any, save
Zeyd], without mentioning that from which the
exception is made; (TA;) and مَا ضَرَبْتُ إِلَّا زَيْدًا
[I beat not any, save Zeyd]; and مَا مَرَرْتُ إِلَّا بِزَيْدٍ
[I passed not by any, save by Zeyd]; (I' Ak
p. 164;) the case of the noun signifying the thing
excepted being the same as if الّا were not mentioned: (I' Ak ubi suprà, and TA:*) but you
may not say, affirmatively, ضَرَبْتُ إِلَّا زَيْدًا, or the
like. (I 'Ak ubi suprà.) When the thing excepted
precedes that from which the exception is made,
if the sentence is affirmative, the noun signifying
the former must be in the accus. case; as in
قَامَ إِلَّا زَيْدًا القَوْمُ [Except Zeyd, the people, or
company of men, stood]: and so, accord. to the
usage generally preferred, when the sentence is
not affirmative; as in مَاقَامَ إِلَّا زَيْدًا القَوْمُ [Except
Zeyd, the people, or company of men, stood not];
but recorded instances allow one's saying also,
مَا قَامَ إِلَّا زَيْدٌ القَوْمُ. (I 'Ak p. 163.) When the
thing excepted is disunited in kind from that from
which the exception is made, if the sentence is
affirmative, the noun signifying the former must
likewise be in the accus. case; as in قَامَ القَوْمُ إِلَّا
حِمَارًا [The people, or company of men, stood, but
not an ass], and ضَرَبْتُ القَوْمَ إِلَّا حِمَارًا [I beat the
people, but not an ass], &c.: (I' Ak p. 162:) and
so, accord. to the generality of the Arabs, when
the sentence is negative; as in مَا قَامَ القَوْمُ إِلَّا حِمَارًا
[The people stood not, but an ass]; (I' Ak p. 163;)
and مَا رَأَيْتُ القَوْمَ إِلَّا حِمَارًا [I saw not the people,
but an ass]; الّا being here syn. with لٰكِنَّ; as
also in the Kur [xlii. 22], where it is said,
لَا أَسْأَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ أَجْرًا إِلَّا الْمَوَدَةَ فِى القُرْبَى [I ask
not of you a recompense for it, but affection in
respect of relationship]; (Msb;) and in the same
xx. 1 and 2, مَا أَنْزَلْنَا عَلَيْكَ القُرْآنَ لِتَشْقَى إِلَّا تَذْكِرَةً
[We have not sent down unto thee the Kur-án
that thou shouldest suffer fatigue, but as an
admonition]; (Bd, Jel;) or it is here syn. with
بَلْ [which in this case means the same as لكنّ]:
(S:) so, too, when the sentence resembles a
negative, being prohibitive or interrogative; (I' Ak
p. 163, explained in p. 162;) [thus, لَا تَضْرِبِ القَوْمَ
إِلَّا حِمَارًا means Beat not thou the people, but an
ass; and] فَلَولَا كَانَتْ قَرْيَةٌ آمَنَتْ فَنَفَعَهَا إِيمَانُهَا إِلَّا
قَوْمَ يُونُسَ [in the Kur x. 98] means And wherefore did not any inhabitants of a town believe,
before the punishment befell them, and their
belief profit them, but the people of Jonas? for
these were different from the former. (T.) When
إِلَّا is repeated for the purpose of corroboration, it
has no effect upon what follows it, except that of
corroborating the first exception; as in مَا مَرَرْتُ
بِأَحَدٍ إَلَّا زَيْدٍ إِلَّا أَخِيكَ [I passed not by any one,
except Zeyd, except thy brother], in which اخيك
is a substitute for زيد, for it is as though you said,
مَا مَرَرْتُ بِأَحَدٍ إِلَّا زَيْدٍ أَخِيكَ; and as in قَامَ القَوْمُ
إِلَّا زَيْدًا وَ إِلَّا عَمْرًا [The people stood, except Zeyd,
and except' Amr], originally إِلَّا زَيْدًا وَ عَمْرًا. When
the repetition is not for that purpose, if the sentence is devoid of the mention of that from which
the exception is made, you make the governing
word [which is the verb] to affect one, whichever
you please, of the nouns signifying the things
excepted, and put the others in the accus. case,
so that you say, مَا قَامَ إِلَّا زَيْدٌ إِلَّا عَمْرًا إِلَّا بَكْرًا
[There stood not any, save Zeyd, save' Amr, save
Bekr]; but if the sentence is not devoid of the
mention of that from which the exception is made,
different rules are observed accord. as the things
excepted are mentioned before that from which
the exception is made or after it: in the former
case, all must be put in the accus., whether the
sentence be affirmative or not affirmative; as in
قَامَ إِلَّا زَيْدًا إِلَّا عَمْرًا إِلَّا بَكْرًا القَوْمُ [Except Zeyd,
except' Amr, except Bekr, the people stood], and
مَاقَامَ إِلَّا زَيْدًا إِلَّا عَمْرًا إِلَّا بَكْرًا القَوْمُ [Except Zeyd,
except' Amr, except Bekr, the people stood not]:
in the latter case, when the sentence is affirmative,
all must likewise be put in the accus., so that you
say, قَامَ القَوْمُ إِلَّا زَيْدًا إِلَّا عَمْرًا إِلَّا بَكْرًا [The people
stood, except Zeyd, except' Amr, except Bekr];
but when the sentence is not affirmative, the same
rule is observed with respect to one of them as
when the exception is not repeated, accord. to the
usage generally preferred, or it may be put in the
accus., which is rarely done, and the rest must be
put in the accus., so that you say, مَا قَامَ أَحَدٌ إِلَّا
زَيْدٌ إِلَّا عَمْرًا إِلَّا بَكْرًا [There stood not any one,
except Zeyd, except' Amr, except Bekr, accord.
to the more approved usage], زيد being a substitute for احد, or you may make the other
nouns which remain to be substitutes. (I' Ak
pp. 164 — 166.) ―
-b2-  Secondly, (Mughnee,) it is
used as a qualificative, (S, Msb, Mughnee, K,)
in the manner of غَيْرُ, (Mughnee, K,) [i. e.]
in the place of غَيْرُ, (S,) [i. e.] as syn. with غَيْرُ,
(T, Msb,) and سِوَى; (T;) [both meaning the
same, i. e. Other than; or not, as used before a
subst. or an adjective;] but its primary application
is to denote exception, and its use as a qualificative
is adventitious; whereas the primary application
of غَيْرُ is as a qualificative, and its use to denote
exception is adventitious. (S.) It [generally]
follows an indeterminate, unrestricted pl.; (Msb;)
or an indeterminate pl., or the like thereof, is
qualified by it and by that which follows it;
(Mughnee, K;) the noun which follows it being
put in the same case as that which precedes it.
(S.) The following is an ex. of the indeterminate
pl.: (Mughnee, K:) لَوْ كَانَ فِيهِمَا آلِهَةٌ إِلَّا اللّٰهُ
لَفَسَدَتَا [If there had been in them (namely the
heavens and the earth) deities other than God, or
not God, assuredly they would have become in a
state of disorder, or ruin; occurring in the Kur
xxi. 22]; (Fr, T, S, Msb, Mughnee, K;) الّا here
meaning سَوِى, (Fr, T,) or غَيْرُ, (Msb, TA,) and
الّا اللّه being a qualificative of آلهة. (TA.) And
the following is an ex. of the like of an indeterminate pl.:
أُنِيخَتْ فَأَلْقَتْ بَلْدَةً فَوْقِ بَلْدَةٍ
قَلِيلٍ بِهَا الأَصْوَاتُ إِلَّا بُغَامُهَا
[She (the camel) was made to lie down, and threw
her breast upon a tract of ground in which were
few sounds other than her broken yearning cry
for her young one]; for the determination of
الاصوات [by the article ال] is generical: (Mughnee, K:) this verse is by Dhu-r-Rummeh. (S in
art. بلد.) The following is an ex. of the like of a
pl..: (Mughnee:) it is by Lebeed: (T:)
لَوْ كَانَ غَيْرِى سُلَيْمَى اليَوْمَ غَيَّرَهُ
وَقْعُ الحَوَادِثِ إِلَّا الصَّارِمُ الذَّكَرُ
[If it had been other than I, (O) Suleymà, today, the befalling of misfortunes would have
altered him; other than the sharp sword diversified
with wavy marks or streaks or grain, or of which
the edge is of steel and the middle of the broad
side of soft iron]. (T, Mughnee. [But in the
latter, in the place of اليَوْمَ, I find الدَّهْرَ, i. e.
ever.]) What Sb says necessarily implies its not
being a condition that the word qualified must be
a pl. or the like thereof; for he gives as an ex.,
لَوْ كَانَ مَعَنَا رَجُلٌ إِلَّ [If there had been
with us a man other than Zeyd, we should have
been overcome]. (Mughnee.) Another ex. of the
same usage of إِلَّا is the following: جَآءَنِى القَوْمُ إِلَّا
زَيْدٌ [The people came to me, others than Zeyd, or
not Zeyd]. (S.) [And مَ أَنْتُمْ إِلَّا بَشَرٌ مِثْلُنَا Ye
are no other than human beings like us. (Kur
xxxvi. 14.)] And the saying [in the Kur xliv. 56],
لَا يَذُقُونَ فِيهَا الْمَوْتَ إِلَّا المَوْتَةَ الْأُولَى [They shall
not taste therein death, other than the first death];
الّا here meaning سِوَى: (T:) or, accord. to some,
it here means بَعْدَ [after]. (Jel.) And the saying
of 'Amr Ibn-Maadee-kerib,
وَ كُلُّ أَخٍ مُفَارِقُهُ أَخُوهُ
لَعَمْرُ أَبِيكَ إِلَا الفَرْقَدَانِ
[And every brother, his brother forsakes him, or
separates himself from him, by the life of thy
father, other than the Farhadán; which is the
name of the two stars b and r of Ursa Minor];
as though he said غَيْرُ الفَرْقَدَيْنِ: (S:) but Ibn-El-Hájib regards this instance as a deviation from
a general rule; for he makes it a condition of the
use of الّا as a qualificative that it must be impossible to use it for the purpose of denoting exception: (Mughnee:) Fr says that this verse has the
meaning of a negation, and therefore الّا here
governs the nom. case; as though the poet said,
There is not any one but his brother forsakes him,
except the Farkadán. (T.) When it is used as a
qualificative, it differs from غَيْرُ inasmuch as that
the noun qualified by it may not be suppressed;
so that one may not say, جَآءَنِى إِلَّا زَيْدٌ [meaning
There came to me not Zeyd]; whereas one says,
جَآئَنِى غَيْرُ زَيْدٍ: and, accord. to some, in this also;
that it may not be used as such unless it may be used
to denote exception; so that one may say, عِنْدِى
دِرْهَمٌ إِلَّا دَانِقٌ [I have a dirhem, not a dánik],
because one may say إِلَّا دَانِقًا [except a dánik];
but not إِلَّا جَيِّدٌ [not a good one], because one
may not say إِلَّا جَيِّدًا [except a good one]; but
it may be said that this is at variance with what
they assert respecting the phrase لَوْ كَانَ فِيهِمَا آلِهَةٌ,
and with the ex. given by Sb, and with the saying
of Ibn-El-Hájib mentioned above. (Mughnee.)
―
-b3-  Thirdly, (Mughnee,) sometimes, (S, Msb,) it
is used as a conjunction, (Mughnee, K,) in the
manner of وَ (S, Mughnee, K,) consociating both
literally and as to the meaning, as mentioned by
Akh and Fr and AO, (Mughnee,) [i. e.] as syn.
with وَ [And]. (Msb.) Thus in the saying,
لِئَلاَّ يَكُونَ لِلنَّاسِ عَلَيْكُمْ حُجَةٌ إِلَّا الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا
[That there may not be to men, against you, any
allegation, and (meaning nor) to those who have
acted wrongfully]; (Msb, Mughnee, K;) occurring
in the Kur [ii. 145]; (Msb;) so accord. to Akh
and Fr and AO; (Mughnee;) i. e., and those
who have acted wrongfully also, to them there
shall not be, against you, any allegation: (Msb:)
Fr explains it as meaning that the wrongdoer has
no allegation of which account should be taken;
and this is correct, and is the opinion held by Zj.
(T.) Thus, too, in the saying [in the Kur xxvii.
10 and 11], لَا يَخَافُ لَدَىَّ الْمُرْسَلُونَ إِلَّا مَنْ ظَلَمَ
ثُمَّ بَدَلَ حُسْنًا بَعْدَ سُوءٍ [The apostles shall not fear
in my presence, and neither shall he who hath
acted wrongfully, then hath done good instead,
after evil; as some explain it; but others say
that وَلَا مَنْ ظَلَمَ here denotes exception]. (Mughnee, in
which it is explained as meaning ; and
K.) And thus in the saying of the poet, [namely,
El-Mukhabbal Es-Saadee, (S in art. خلد,)]
وَأَرَى لَهَا دَارًا بِأَغْدِرَة السْ??
سِيدَانِ لَمْ يَدْرُسْ لَهَا رَسْمُ
إِلَّا رَمَادًا هَامِدًا دَفَعَتْ
عَنْهُ الرِّيَاحَ خَوَالِدٌ سُحْمٌ
[And I see a dwelling formerly belonging to her,
at the pools of Es-Seedán, (a hill so called,) the
remains of which have not become effaced, and
ashes wasted and compacted together, from which
three black pieces of stone whereon the cooking-pot
was wont to be placed turned back the winds]:
he means, أَرَى لَهَا دَارًا وَ رَمَادًا. (S.) ―
-b4-  Fourthly,
(Mughnee,) it is redundant, as in the following
verse, (S in art. فك, Mughnee, K,) of Dhu-rRummeh, (S ubi suprà, Mughnee,) accord. to As
and IJ: (Mughnee:)
حَرَاجِيجُ مَا تَنْفَكُّ إِلَّا مُنَاخَةٌ
عَلَى الخَسْفِ أَوْ نَرْمِى بِهَا بَلَدًا قَفْرَا
[She-camels long-bodied, or lean, (but other meanings are assigned to the word which I thus
render,) that cease not to be made to lie down
in a state of hunger, or with which we direct
our course to a desert region]; (S ubi suprà,
Mughnee; [but in one copy of the former, in
the place of نَرْمِى, I find يَرْمِى; and in my copy
of the latter, تَرْمِى;]) meaning, ما تنفكّ مناخةً:
(S ubi suprà:) but it is said that this is a mistake
of the poet: (Mughnee:) so says Aboo-'Amr
Ibn-El-'Alà; for, he says, الّا is not to be introduced after تَنْفَكُّ and تَزَالُ: (TA:) and some
say that the right reading is إِلًّا, with tenween,
[perhaps a mistranscription, for آلًا,] meaning
شَخْصًا [in a pl. sense]: and some, that تنفكّ
is a complete [or an attributive] verb, and مناخة
is a denotative of state; [consequently, that إِلَّا
is a compound of إِنْ and لَا, as in some other
instances hereafter to be mentioned;] the meaning
being, that are not disengaged, or not free, from
fatigue [unless when made to lie down]. (Mughnee.) The following is also given as an ex. of
the same kind:
أَرَى الدَّهْرَ إِلَّا مَنْجَنُونًا بِأَهْلِهِ
[I see fortune, or time, to be like a water-wheel,
with its people]: but the reading which is remembered to have been heard is وَمَا الدَّهْرُ: and if
the former be correct, it may be explained on
the supposition that ارى is the complement of
an oath meant to be understood, and that لا is
suppressed, as in [the saying in the Kur xii. 85,]
تَاللّٰهِ تَفْتَأُ تَذْكُرُ يُوسُفَ; [so that the meaning is,
I see not fortune, or time, to be aught save a
water-wheel, with its people;] the form of the
exceptive sentence which is devoid of the mention
of that from which the exception is made indicating such an explanation. (Mughnee.) ―
-b5-
[Fifthly,] it occurs as syn. with لضَا [as a particle
denoting exception, equivalent to our But;
meaning both except and (after an oath or the like)
only, or nothing more than]; as in the saying
in the Kur [xxxviii. 13], إِنْ كُلٌّ إِلَّا كَذَّبَ الرُّسُلَ
[There was not any one but such as accused the
apostles of lying], in which 'Abd-Allah reads,
in its place, لَمَّا; and for كُلٌّ he reads كُلُّهُمْ;
and as in the saying, أَسْأَلُكَ بِاللّٰهِ إِلَّا أَعْطَيْتَنِى [I
ask, or beg, or beseech, thee by God but that
thou give me; i. e., I do not ask of thee anything save thy giving me; the preterite here,
as in many instances in which it is preceded by
لَمَّا (q. v.), not being a preterite in meaning];
for which one says also لَمَّا اعطيتنى. (T.)
-A2-  It
is also a particle [or rather a compound of two
words] denoting the complement of a condition;
originally إِنْ لَا, which form a compound that
does not admit of [the pronunciation termed]
imáleh, because إِنْ and لَا are particles. (T.)
[It signifies, lit., If not.] It is followed by a
fut., which it renders mejzoom; [and in this
case it may be rendered as above, or by unless;]
as in the saying in the Kur [viii. 74], إِلَا تَفْعَلُوهُ
تَكُنْ فِتْنَةٌ فِى الأَرْضِ [If ye do it not, or unless ye
do it, there will be a weakness of faith and an
appearing of unbelief in the earth]. (T.) [In
like manner,] in a saying such as the following, [in
the Kur ix. 40,] إِلَّا تَنْصُرُوهُ فَقَدْ نَصَرَهُ اللّٰهُ [If ye
do not, or will not, aid him, certainly God aided
him], it is only a compound of two words, the
conditional إِنْ and the negative لَا, and is distinct
from إِلَّا of which the usages have been mentioned
before, though Ibn-Málik has included it therewith. (Mughnee.) [Often in post-classical works,
and perhaps in classical also, but seldom except
when it is preceded by a condition with its complement, the verb or verbal proposition which
should immediately follow it is suppressed; as
in the like of the saying, إِنْ فَعَلْتَ كَذَا عَفَوْتُ
عَنْكَ وَ إِلَّا قَتَلْتُكَ If thou do such a thing, I forgive
thee, or cancel thine offence; but if thou wilt not
do it (i. e., إِلَّا تَفْعَلْهُ,) I kill thee: sometimes
also it ends a sentence, by an aposiopesis; the
whole of what should follow it being suppressed:
and sometimes the complement of the condition
which precedes, as well as the verb or verbal
proposition which should immediately follow it,
is suppressed; so that you say, إِنْ فَعَلْتُ كَذَا
وَ إِلَّا قَتَلْتُكَ If thou do such a thing, excellent
will it be, or the like, فَنِعِمَّا هُوَ, or the like,
being understood,) but if not, I kill thee.
Hence,] it sometimes has the meaning of إِمَّا,
[signifying Or, denoting an alternative, corresponding to a preceding إِمَّا, which signifies
“either,”] as in the saying, إِمَّا أَنْ تُكَلِّمَنِى وَ إِلَّا
فَاسْكُتْ [Either do thou speak to me or else
(meaning وَ إِلَّا تُكَلِّمَنِى or if thou wilt not speak
to me) be silent], i. e., وَ إِمَّا أَنْ تَسْكُتَ. (S.) [It
is also followed by أَنْ, as in إِلَّا أَنْ يَشَآءَ اللّٰهُ Unless
God should please; in the Kur vi. 111, &c.
And by و as a denotative of state, as in لَا تَمُوتُنَّ
إِلَّا وَ أَنْتُمْ مُسْلِمُونَ Do not ye die unless ye be
Muslims; in the Kur ii. 126 and iii. 97. And
sometimes it is preceded by اَللّهُمَّ; for the effect
of which, in this case, see art. اله.]
