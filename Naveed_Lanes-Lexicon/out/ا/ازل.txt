أَزَلٌ i. q. قِدَمٌ [i. e. Eternity, with respect to
past time, or considered retrospectively; existence
from eternity; or ancientness] (S, K, TA) that
is without beginning; (TA;) or the continuance
of existence in decreed times interminable in
respect of the past; like as أَبَدٌ is the continuance
of existence in decreed times interminable in
respect of the future; (KT;) or that [existence,
or time,] which has no extremity in its beginning;
like قِدَمٌ; and أَبَدٌ is that which has no extremity
in its latter part; like بَقَآءٌ: the former is existence
without any beginning: (Kull p. 31:) said to be
from the phrase لَمْ يَزَلْ [“he, or it, has not
ceased” to be &c.; i. e. “has ever” been &c.
(see أَزَلِىٌّ)]: or, accord. to some, from أَزْلٌ signifying “narrowness;” because the intellect is prevented by its narrowness from perceiving its
beginning: (MF:) ازل is a name for that of
which the mind is prevented by its narrowness
from determining the limit of the beginning;
from أَزْلٌ meaning “narrowness;”; and ابد is a
name for that of which the mind shrinks from,
or shuns, the determining the limit of the end;
from أُبُودٌ meaning the act of “shrinking” from a
thing, or “shunning” it. (Kull pp. 30 and 31.)
Hence the saying, كَانَ فِى الأَزَلِ قَادِرًا عَالِمًا [He
was, or has been, ever, powerful, knowing]. (A,
TA.) The phrase أَزَلَ الآزَالِ [During the space,
without beginning, of all past times; or ever, in
all past times;] is like the phrase أَبَدَ الآبَادِ; said
to be no evidence of the use of آزَالٌ as a pl. of أَزَلٌ
in a general way by the Arabs of the classical
ages, as it is here added merely as a corroborative.
(MF in art. ابد.) [See also أَزَلِىٌّ.]
أَزِلٌ: see آزِلٌ.
أَزَلِىٌّ [Eternal, with respect to past time; existing from eternity; or ancient without beginning;
as is implied in the S and K &c.;] a thing, or
being, which has not been preceded by non-existence: it is applied to God: and to [his] knowledge: that which exists must be one of three
kinds only: أَزَلِىٌّ أَبَدِىٌّ [existing from eternity,
and consequently existing to eternity]; and this
is God [who is also called القَدِيمُ الأَزَلِىُّ the
Ancient without beginning]: and لَا أَزَلِىٌّ وَ لَا أَبَدِىٌّ
[not existing from eternity nor existing to eternity]; and such is the present world: and أَبَدِىٌّ
غَيْرُ أَزَلِىّ [existing to eternity without existing
from eternity]; and such is the world to come;
the reverse of which [last] is impossible: (TA:)
it is a rel. n. from أَزَلٌ: or, accord. to some, it is
not [genuine] Arabic: (TA:) or it is originally
يَزَلِىٌّ, a rel. n. from لَمْ يَزَلْ, (S, K,) a phrase
applied to that which is قَدِيم; and is formed by
contraction; (S;) then, the ى is changed into ا,
as being easier of pronunciation; as in أَزَنِىٌّ,
applied to a spear, in relation to ذُو يَزَن; (S, K,*
Sgh, TA;) and as in أَثْرَبِىٌّ, applied to a blade,
(S, Sgh, TA,) in relation to يَثْرِب: (TA:) so say
some of the learned. (S.)
أَزَلِيَّةٌ The quality, or attribute, of أَزَلٌ [eternity,
with respect to past time, &c.]: but it is a forged
term, not of the [genuine] language of the Arabs.

strait, or narrow. (Lh.)
