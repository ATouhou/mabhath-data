أَبَوْتُ, [third pers. أَبَا,] (T, S, M, K,) and
أَبَيْتُ, [third pers. أَبَى,] (T, M, K,) the latter accord. to Yz, (T,) aor. آبُو, (TK,) inf. n. أُبُوَّةٌ, (Yz,
T, S, Msb,) or this is a simple subst., (M,) I became a father. (T, * S, * M, K.) ―
-b2-  أَبَوْتُهُ, (ISk, T,
M, K,) aor. آبُوهُ, (IAar, ISk, T,) inf. n. إِبَاوَةٌ,
(M, K,) I was, (IAar, ISk, T,) or became, (M,
K,) a father to him. (IAar, ISk, T, M, K.) ―
-b3-
[Hence, I fed him, or nourished him; and reared
him, or brought him up.] You say, فُلَانٌ يَأْبُو هٰذَا
اليَتِيمَ, inf. n. إِبَاوَةٌ, Such a one feeds, or nourishes,
this orphan, like as the father does his children.
(Lth, T.) And مَالَهُ أَبٌ يَأْبُوهُ (ISk, T, S) He has
not a father to feed him, or nourish him, and to
rear him, or bring him up. (S.)
2
أَبَّيْتُهُ, inf. n. تَأْبِيَةٌ, I said to him بِأَبِى [meaning فُدِيَتِ بِأَبِى Mayest thou be ransomed with my
father! or the like: see أَبٌ, below]. (K, TA.
[In the CK, erroneously, يا اَبِى.])
5
تأبّاهُ He adopted him as a father; (M, K,
TA;) as also ↓ استأباهُ; (M in art. اب;) and so
تأبّاهُ أَبًا, accord. to A'Obeyd: (TA:) [or,] accord.
to A'Obeyd, you say, تَأَبَّيْتُ أَبًا I adopted a father:
(T:) and you say also, اِسْتَأَبَّ أَبًا and اِسْتَأْبَبَ أَبًا
he adopted a father. (TA.)

إِسْتَاْبَوَ see 5.
أَبٌ is originally أَبَوٌ, (S, Msb, K,) as is shown
by the first of its dual forms and of its pl. forms
mentioned below; (S, Msb;) and signifies A
father [in the ordinary sense: and also as meaning (assumed tropical:)  an ancestor]: (M:) as also ↓ أَبًا, a dial. var.,
(M, K,) the same in the nom. and accus. and gen.
cases, like قَفًا: (M:) and أَبٌّ is a dial. var. of the
same, [the second letter being doubled to compensate for the و suppressed, as is the case in أَخٌّ,
(TA voce أَخٌ)] but is rare. (Msb.) Accord. to
the dial. commonly obtaining, when you use it as
a prefixed noun, you decline it with the letters و
and ا and ى, saying, هٰذَاأَبُوهُ [This is his father],
(Msb,) and أَبُوكَ [thy father]; (M;) and رَأَيْتُ أَبَاهُ
[I saw his father]; and مَرَرْتُ بِأَبِيهِ [I passed by
his father]: (Msb:) but accord. to one dial.,
you say, هٰذَا أَبَاهُ, (Msb:) and أَبَاكَ; (M;) and
رَأَيْتُ أَبَاهُ; and مَرَرْتُ بِأَبَاهُ: (Msb:) and accord.
to one dial., which is the rarest of all, it is defective in every case, like يَدٌ and دَمٌ; (Msb;) and
[thus] you say, هٰذَا أَبُوكَ [&c.]. (M.) The dual is
أَبَوَانِ, (S, M, Msb,) meaning [two fathers, and]
father and mother; and some say أَبَانِ: (S, M:)
you say, هُمَاأَبَوَاهُ, meaning They two are his
father and mother; and in poetry you may say,
هُمَا أَبَاهُ; and in like manner, رَأَيْتُ أَبَيْهِ [I saw his
father and mother], (T,) and أَبَيْكَ [thy father
and mother]; (S;) but the usual, or chaste, form
is رَأَيْتُ أَبَوَيْهِ. (T.) The pl. is آبَآءٌ, (T, S, M, Msb,
K,) the best form, (T,) and أَبُونَ, (T, S, M, K,)
and أُبُوٌّ (M, K, [in the CK الاَبْوٌ is erroneously
put for الأُبُوٌّ,]) and أُبُوَّةٌ, (Lh, T, S, M, K, *) like
عُمُومَةٌ and خُؤُولَةٌ: (T, S:) you say, هٰؤُلَآءِ أَبُوكُمْ,
meaning آبَاؤُكُمْ [These are your fathers]; (T;)
and hence, in the Kur [ii. 127], accord. to one
reading, وَإِلٰهَ أَبِيكَ إِبرٰهِيمَ وَإِسْمٰعِيلَ وَإِسْحٰقَ [And
the God of thy fathers, Abraham and Ishmael
and Isaac], meaning the pl. of أبٌ, i. e. أَبِينَكَ, of
which the ن is suppressed because the noun is
prefixed [to the pronoun]; (S;) and some of the
Arabs say, أَبُوَّتُنَا أَكْرَمُ الآبَآءِ [Our fathers are the
most generous of fathers]. (T.) The dim. is ↓ أُبَّىٌّ;
originally أُبَيْوٌ, with the final radical letter restored.
(Msb.) ―
-b2-  مَا يَدْرِى لَهُ مِنْ أَبٍ, and مَا أَبٌ, mean-
ing He knows not who is his father, and what is
his father, are sayings mentioned by Lh on the
authority of Ks. (M.) ―
-b3-  لَا أَبَا لِكَ, (T, S, M, K,
&c.,) [accord. to the dial. of him who says أَبًا instead of أَبٌ,] as also لَا أَبَ لَكَ, and لَا أَبَاكَ, (S, K,)
[the last, accord. to J, because the ل (meaning
the ل in لك in the preceding phrases) is as though
it were redundant, but he seems not to have
known the dial. var. أَبًا, and I rather think that
لَا أَبَاكَ, is for لَا أَبْقَى اللّٰهُ أَبَاكَ, or the like,] and
لَا أَبَكَ, (Mbr, Sgh, K,) and لَابَ لَكَ, (K,) which
is for لَا أَبَ لَكَ, (M,) means Thou art, in my estimation, one deserving of its being said to him,
Mayest thou have no father! it is used in the
manner of a proverb, is of frequent occurrence in
poetry, (M,) is said to him who has a father and
to him who has not a father, and is an imprecation as to the meaning, of necessity, though enunciative as to the letter; (M, K;) and hence the
saying of Jereer,
يَا تَيْمُ تَيْمَ عَدِىٍّ لَا أَبَا لَكُمْ
[O Teym, Teym of 'Ades, may ye have no
father!]; which is the strongest evidence of its
being a proverb, and not having a literal meaning;
for all of [the tribe of] Teym could not have one
father, but all of them were fit objects of imprecation and rough speech: (M:) it is an expression
of praise: (S:) [i. e.] it is an imprecation against
him to whom it is addressed, not, however, said
with the desire of its having effect, but on an
occasion of intense love, like لَا أُمَّ لَكَ, &c.: (Har
p. 165:) and sometimes in dispraise, like لَا أُمَّ لَكَ:
and in wonder, like لِلّهِ دَرُّكَ: (TA:) or, as A
Heyth says, on the authority of Aboo-Sa'eed Ed-
Dareer, it expresses the utmost degree of reviling;
[meaning Thou hast no known father;] and
لَا أُمَّ لَكَ expresses reviling also, but means Thou
hast no free, or ingenuous, mother: (Meyd in
Har p. 165: [see أُمَّ:]) sometimes it means
Strive, or exert thyself, in thine affair; for he
who has a father relies upon him in some circumstances of his case: (TA:) accord. to Kh, it means
Thou hast none to stand thee in stead of thyself:
(ISh, TA:) Fr says that it is a phrase used by
the Arabs [parenthetically, i.e.,] to divide their
speech: (TA:) [thus, for instance,] Zufar Ibn-El-Hárith says,
أَرِينِى سِلَاحِى لَا أَبَا لَكَ إِنَّنِى
أَرَى الحَرْبَ لَا تَزْدَادُ إِلَّا تَمَادِيَا
[Show thou me my weapons: (mayest thou have
no father! or thou hast no father: &c.:) verily
I see the war, or battle, increases not save in perseverance]. (TA.) [Aboo-'Alee, as cited in the M,
observes that the ا (meaning the final ا) in أَبَا, in
the phrase لَا أَبَا لَكَ, indicates that it is a prefixed
noun, and determinate; whereas the ل in لك
together with the government exercised upon the
noun by لا indicates that it is, on the contrary,
indeterminate, and separate from what follows it:
but it seems that he was unacquainted with the
dial. var. أَبَّا; for لَا أَبَا لَكَ in the dial. of him who
uses the form أَبَّا instead of أَبٌ is the same grammatically as لَا أَبَ لَكَ in the dial. of him who uses
the form أَبٌ.] Suleymán Ibn-'Abd-El-Melik
heard an Arab of the desert, in a year of drought,
say, أَنْزِلْ عَلَيْنَا الغَيْثَ لَا أَبَا لَكَ, and Suleymán put
the best construction upon it, [as though it meant,
Send down upon us rain: Thou hast no father],
and said, I testify that He hath no father nor
female companion nor offspring. (TA.) They say
also, in paying honour [to a person], لَا أَبَ لِشَانِئِكَ,
and لَا أَبَ لِشَانِئِكَ, (TA,) i. e. May thy hater have
no father! or, accord. to ISk, each is a metonymical expression for لَا أَبَا لَكَ. (S in art. شنأ,
q. v.) ―
-b4-  One also says, on the occasion of an
occurrence that is approved and commended, by
way of expressing wonder and praise, لَلِّهِ أَبُوكَ,
meaning To God, purely, is attributable [the
excellence of] thy father, seeing that he begat thee
a generous son, and produced the like of thee!
(TA;) [or to God be attributed (the excellence
of) thy father!] it means that to God [alone]
belongs the power to create the like of this man
[to whom it relates], from whom has proceeded
this wonderful action. (Har p. 44.) ―
-b5-  And
هِىَ بِنْتُ أَبِيهَا, meaning She resembles her father
in strength of mind, or spirit, and sharpness of
disposition, and in hastening, or striving to be
first, to do things: said of Hafsah, by 'Áïsheh.
(TA.) ―
-b6-  بِأَبِى, (TA,) or بِأَبِى أَنْتَ, (T in art. بأ,)
[said to a person,] means [فُدِيتَ بِأَبِى Mayest
thou be ransomed with my father! (see the next
sentence but one;) or] أَفْدِيكَ بِأَبِى [I will ransom thee with my father]; (T ubi suprà;) or
أَنْتَ مَفْدِىٌّ بِأَبِى Thou art, or shalt be, ransomed
with my father]; or فَدَيُتُكَ بِأَبِى [I have in my
heart ransomed thee, or I would ransom thee, with
my father]; the ب being dependent upon a word
suppressed, which, accord. to some, is a [pass.
participial] noun, and accord. to others, a verb;
and this word is suppressed because of the frequent usage of the phrase. (TA.) You say also,
بِأَبِى أَنْتَ وَ أُمِّى [With my father mayest thou be
ransomed, and with my mother!]. (TA.) And
بِأَبِى مَنْ وَدَدتُّهُ, i. e. فُدِىَ بِأَبِى مَنْ وَدَدتُّهُ [May
he whom I love be ransomed with my father!],
meaning may he [my father] be made a ransom
for him [whom I love]! (El-Wáhidee on the
Deewán of El-Mutanebbee, in De Sacy's Chrest.
Arabe, sec. ed. vol. iii. p. 35 of the Arabic text.)
Sometimes they change the ى into ا: a poet
says,
وَقَدْ زَعَمُوا أَنِّى جَزِعْتُ عَلَيْهِمَا
وَهَلْ جَزَعٌ أَنْ قُلْتُ وَا بِأَبَا هُمَا
[And they have asserted that I have become impatient on account of them two: but is it an evidence of impatience that I said, Alas, with my
father may they two be ransomed?]; meaning
وَا بِأَبِى هُمَا. (S.) And some of the Arabs used to
say, وَا بِأَبَا أَنْتَ [Alas, with my father mayest thou
be ransomed!]: this, says AM, being like يَا وَيْلَتَا
for يَا وَيْلَتِى; as also يَا بَيْبَا, with the hemzeh
changed into ى, originally يَا بِأَبَا, meaning يَابِأَبِى:
and hence what is related, in a trad., of Umm-
'Ateeyeh; that she used not to mention the Prophet without saying, بِيَبَا [for بِأَبِ هُوَ]. (TA in
art. بأ.) A woman said,
يَا بِأَبِى أَنْتَ وَ يَا فَوْقَ البِيَبْ
[O thou to whom I would say, With my father
mayest thou be ransomed! and O thou who art
above him to whom I would address the saying,
With my father mayest thou be ransomed!]; respecting which Fr observes that the two words
[بِ and أَب] are made as one [by prefixing the
article] because of their frequent occurrence; (S;)
and Aboo-'Alee says that the ى in بِيَب is substituted for ء, not necessarily; but ISk quotes the
words as commencing with يَا بِيَبَا, which is the
right reading, in order that this expression may
agree with البِئَبْ, which is derived from it: EtTebreezee, however, relates Abu-l-'Alà's reciting
the words as ending with البِئَبْ; saying that this
is compounded from the phrase بِأَبِي, and that
therefore the ء is preserved. (TA.) [See also the
first paragraph in art. بأ.] ―
-b7-  You say also, يَا أَبَتِ
[meaning O my father], (S, M, K,) as in يَا أَبَتِ
افْعَلْ [O my father, do thou such a thing]; (S;)
and يَا أَبَتَ; (S, M, K;) and يَاأَبَتُ; (Z in the
Ksh xii. 4;) and يَا أَبَهْ (S, M, K) when you pause
after it. (S, M.) The ة, [here written ت,] (Kh,
M,) the sign of the fem. gender, (S, Z,) is substituted for the [pronominal] affix ى, (Kh, S, M, Z,)
as in يَاأُمَّتِ; (S;) and is like the ة in عَمَةٌ and
خَالَةٌ, as is shown by your saying, in pausing,
يَا أَبَهٌ, like as you say, يَا خَالَةٌ: (Kh, M:)
the annexing of the fem. ت to a masc. noun
in this case is allowable, like as it is in حَمَامَةٌ ذَكَرٌ
and شَاةٌ ذَكَرٌ and رَجُلٌ رَبْعَةٌ and غَلَامٌ يَفَعَةٌ: its
being made a substitute for the affix ى is allowable because each of these is an augmentative
added at the end of a noun: and the kesreh is the
same that is in the phrase يَا أَبِى: (Z ubi suprà:)
the ت does not fall from اب in the phrase يَا أَبَتِ
when there is no pause after it, though it [sometimes] does from أُمّ in the like phrase in that
case, because the former word, being of [only]
two letters, is as though it were defective. (S.)
يَا أَبَتَ is for يَا أَبَتَا, (Aboo-'Othmán El-Mázinee,
S, * M, [the latter expression mentioned also in
the K, but not as being the original of the former,])
the ا [and ه] being suppressed; (the same Aboo-
'Othmán and M;) or for يَا أَبَتَا, the ا being suppressed, like as the ى is in يَا غُلَامِ; or it may be
after the manner of يَاأَبِىَ. (Z ubi suprà.) يَا أَبَتُ
is thus pronounced after the usual manner of a
noun ending with the fem. ة, without regard to
the fact that the ت is in the former a substitute
for the suffix ى. (Z ubi suprà.) يَا أَبَهْ is said in a
case of pause, except in the Kur-án, in which, in
this case, you say, يَا أَبَهْ, following the written
text; and some of the Arabs pronounce the fem. ة,
in a case of pause, ت [in other instances], thus
saying, يَا طَلْحَتُ. (S.) يَا أَبَاهُ is also said; (M,
K;) though scarcely ever. (M.) A poet uses the
expression يَا أَبَاتَ, for يَا أَبَتَاهْ: (S, M:) IB says
that this is used only by poetic license, in a case
of necessity in verse. (TA.) ―
-b8-  أَبٌ is tropically
applied to signify (tropical:)  A grandfather, or any ancestor. (Msb.) ―
-b9-  It is also applied to signify (assumed tropical:)  A
paternal uncle; as in the Kur ii. 127, quoted
before. (M.) ―
-b10-  [It is also (like أُمّ and اِبْن and
بِنْت) prefixed to nouns of various significations.
Most of the compounds thus formed will be found
explained in the arts. to which belong the nouns
that occupy the second place. The following are
among the more common, and are therefore here
mentioned, as exs. of different kinds.] ―
-b11-  أَبُو المَرْأَةِ
(assumed tropical:)  The woman's husband: (Ibn-Habeeb, M:) it is
said in the TS that الأَبُ, in certain of the dials.,
signifies the husband: MF deems this meaning
strange. (TA.) أَبُو المَثْوَى (assumed tropical:)  The master of the
dwelling, or of the place of abode: (TA:) and
(assumed tropical:)  the guest. (K in art. ثوى.) أَبُو الأَضْيَافِ (assumed tropical:)  The
very hospitable man. (TA.) ―
-b12-  أَبُو الحَارِثِ (assumed tropical:)  The
lion. (TA.) أَبُو جَعْدَةَ (assumed tropical:)  The wolf. (TA.) أَبُو
الحُصَيْنِ (assumed tropical:)  The fox. (TA.) ―
-b13-  أَبُو جَابِر (assumed tropical:)  Bread. (S
and K in art. جبر.) ―
-b14-  أَبُو مَالِكٍ (assumed tropical:)  Extreme old age:
(TA:) and (assumed tropical:)  hunger. (MF in art. جبر.)

of fathership]. (S.)
