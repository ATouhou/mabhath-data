أَثَاثٌGoods; or utensils and furniture of a
house or tent; household-goods; syn. مَتَاعٌ; (T,
M;) or مَتَاعُ بَيْت; (S, Msb, K;) of whatever
kind; consisting of clothes, and stuffing for
mattresses or the like, or outer garments [&c.]:
(M, TA:) or (so accord. to the M and K, but in
the T “also,”) all property, (AZ, T, S, M, K,)
[consisting of] camels, and sheep or goats, and
slaves, and utensils and furniture or householdgoods: (AZ, T, S:) or abundant property: or
abundance of property: (M, TA:) [in which last
sense it is an inf. n. used as simple subst.:] or
what is made, or taken, for use, and i. q. مَتَاعٌ;
not what is for merchandise: or what is new, of
the utensils and furniture of a house or tent; not
what is old and worn out: (TA:) [it is a coll.
gen. n., and] the n. un. is with اثر: (AZ, T, S, M,
Msb, K:) or it has no n. un.: (Fr, T, S, Msb,
K:) if you form a pl. from اثاث, you say, ثَلَاثَةُ
آثَّةٍ, [originally أَأْثِثَة, like أَطْعِمَة, pl. of طَعَام,]
and أُثُثٌ كَثِيرَةٌ. (Fr, T.)
أَثِيثٌMuch in quantity, abundant, or numerous: and great, or large: as also ↓ أَثٌّ; (M, K;)
which is, in my opinion, [says ISd, originally
أَثِثٌ,] of the measure فَعِلٌ: (M:) the fem. is
أَثِيثَةٌ: and the pl. is إِثَاثٌand أَثَائِثُ; (M, K; *)
both being pls. of the masc. and of the fem.; (K;)
or the latter is pl. of the fem. only; (M, * MF;)
but the former is [pl. of the masc.,] like كِرَامٌas
pl. of كَرِيمٌ, (TA,) and is pl. of the fem. also.

tangled, or luxuriant: (S:) or abundant (T, M) and
long. (M.) And لِحْيَةٌ أَثِيثَةٌ, and ↓ أَثَّةٌ, A thick beard.
(M, TA.) And اِمْرَأَةٌ أَثِيثَةٌA fleshy woman: (M,
TA:) pl. أَثَائِثُ, (M,) signifying fleshy women;
(S, M, K;) as also إِثَاثٌ: (M:) or the former of
these pls. signifies tall, full-grown, women. (K.)
أَثَاثِىُّi. q. أَثَافِىُّ, (K,) i. e. The [three] stones
which are set up and upon which the cooking-pot
is placed: the [second] ثis said to be a substitute for ف, and some hold the hemzeh to be augmentative. (TA.)
