اثم1
أَثِمَ, (Lth, S, M, &c.,) aor.
اَثَمَ, (Lth, M, Msb,
K,) inf. n. إِثْمٌ, (S, K,) or أَثَمٌ, the former being a
simple subst., (Msb,) and مَأْثَمٌ, (S, K,) He fell
into what is termed إِثْمٌ [i. e. a sin, or crime, &c.];
(Lth, T, S, M, Msb, * K *;) [he sinned; committed
a sin, or crime;] he did what was unlawful:
(M, * K:) and ↓ تَأْثِيمٌ signifies the same as إِثْمٌ:
(K:) it may be either an inf. n. of ↓ أَثَمَ, which
[says ISd] I have not heard, or, as Sb holds it to
be, a simple subst. like تَنْبِيتٌ: (M:) and is said
to be used in the sense of إِثْم in the Kur lii. 23
[and lvi. 24]. (TA.) [It should be added also,
that ↓ تأْثَامٌ, like تَكْذَابٌ, is syn. with تأْثِيمٌ and
إِثْمٌ; and, like تأثيم, may be an inf. n. of ↓ أَثَّمَ, or
a simple subst.: see an ex. voce بَرُوقٌ.] In the
dial. of some of the Arabs, the first letter of the
aor. is with kesr, as in تِعْلَمُ and نِعْلَمُ; and as the
hemzeh in إِثْمٌ is with kesr, the radical hemzeh [in
the aor.] is changed into ى; so that they say
إِيثَمُ and تِيثَمُ [for آثَمُ and تَأْثَمُ.] (TA.) In the saying,
لَوْ قُلْتَ مَا فِى قَوْمَهَا لَمْ تِيثَمِ
يَفْضُلَهَا فِى حَسَبٍ وَمِيسَمِ
the meaning is, [Shouldst thou say, thou wouldst
not sin, or do wrong, in so saying,] There is not,
among her people, any one who excels her [in
grounds of pretension to respect, and in impress, or
character, of beauty]. (M.)
-A2-  أَثَمَهُ اللّٰهُ فِى كَذَا,
aor.
اَثُمَ (S, K) and
اَثِمَ, (S,) or
اَثَمَ, (K,) but there
is no other authority than the K for this last, nor
is there any reason for it, as the medial radical
letter is not faucial, nor is the final, and in the
Iktitáf el-Azáhir the aor. is said to be
اَثِمَ and
اَثُمَ,
(MF, TA,) [God reckoned him to have sinned,
or committed a crime or the like, in such a thing;
or] God reckoned such a thing against him as an
إِثْم: (S, K:) or أَثَمَهُ, aor.
اَثِمَ (Fr, T, M, Msb)
and
اَثُمَ, (Msb,) inf. n. أَثْمٌ (Fr, T, Msb) and أَثَامٌ
(Fr, T, TA) and إِثَامٌ, (Fr, TA,) He (God) requited him, (Fr, T,) or punished him, (M,) for
what is termed إِثْمٌ [i. e. sin, or crime, &c.]: (Fr,
T, M:) [see also أَثَامٌ below:] or he (a man)
pronounced him to be آثم [i. e. a sinner, or the
like]: (Msb:) [or] ↓ آثَمَهُ, aor. يَؤْثِمُهُ, has this last
signification, said of God; and also signifies
He found him to be so. (T.) ―
-b2-  You say also,
أَثَمَتِ النَّاقَةُ المَشْىَ, aor.
اَثِمَ, inf. n. أَثْمٌ, The she-camel was slow. (M.)
2
أثّمهُ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَأْثِيمٌ, (Msb, K,)
He said to him أَثِمْتَ [Thou hast fallen into a sin,
or crime, &c.; hast sinned, &c.]. (S, Msb, K.)
-A2-  See also 1, first and second sentences.
4
آثمهُ He made him, or caused him, to fall
into what is termed إِثْمٌ [i. e. a sin, or crime, &c.],
(Zj, S, M, K,) or what is termed ذَنْبٌ. (Msb.) ―
-b2-
See also 1, last sentence but one.
5
تأثّم He abstained from what is termed إِثْمٌ
[i. e. sin, or crime, &c.]; (T, S, M, Msb, K;)
like تَحَرَّجَ meaning “ he preserved himself from
what is termed حَرَجٌ: ” (Msb:) or he did a work,
or deed, whereby he escaped from what is termed
إِثْمٌ: (TA:) and he repented of what is so termed,
(M, K,) and begged forgiveness of it; as though
he removed the إِثْم itself by repentance and by
begging forgiveness; or sought to do so by those
two means. (M.) You say also, تأثّم مِنْ كَذَا
He abstained from such a thing as a sin, or
crime; syn. تَحَّنَثَ, q. v. (S, K, in art. حنث.)
إِثْمٌ [accord. to some, an inf. n.; see أَثِمَ: accord.
to others, only a simple subst., signifying] A sin,
a crime, a fault, an offence, or an act of disobedience, syn. ذَنْبٌ, (S, M, Msb, K,) for which
one deserves punishment; differing from ذَنْبٌ
inasmuch as this signifies both what is intentional
and what is unintentional: (Kull:) or [so accord.
to the M, but in the K “ and,”] an unlawful deed:
(M, K:) or a deed which retards from recompense:
or, accord. to Fr, what is exclusive of the [punishment termed] حَدّ: accord. to Er-Rághib, it is a
term of more general import than عُدَوانٌ: (TA:)
↓ مَأْثَمٌ [which is originally an inf. n. of أَثِمَ] is
syn. with إِثْمٌ; (T, * Mgh;) and so, too, is ↓ أَثَامٌ,
(Msb,) or ↓ إِثَامٌ, signifying a deed retarding
recompense: (TA:) the pl. of إِثْمٌ is آثَامٌ: (M:)
and the pl. of ↓ مَأْثَمٌ is مَآثِمُ. (T.) ―
-b2-  [Sometimes
it is prefixed to a noun or pronoun denoting its
object: ―
-b3-  and sometimes it means (assumed tropical:)  The punishment of a sin &c.: see explanations of a passage
in the Kur v. 32, voce بَآءَ.] ―
-b4-  Wine: (Aboo-Bekr El-Iyádee, T, S, M, K:) sometimes used in
this sense; (S;) but tropically; not properly:
(IAmb:) I think, [says ISd,] because the drinking
thereof is what is thus termed. (M.) ―
-b5-  [And for
a like reason,] (assumed tropical:)  Contention for stakes, or wagers,
in a game of hazard; syn. قِمَارٌ; (M, K;) which
is a man's destruction of his property. (M.) It
is said in the Kur [ii. 216, respecting wine and
the game called المَيْسِر], قُلْ فِهِيمَا إِثْمٌ كَبِيرٌ وَ مَنَافِعُ
لِلنَّاسِ [Say thou, In them both are great sin and
means of profit to men]: and Th says, when they
contended in a game of this kind, and won, they
gave food and alms, and these were means of
profit. (M.)
أَثَامٌ: see إِثْمٌ. ―
-b2-  Also The requital, or recompense, of إِثّم [i. e. sin, or crime, &c.]: (T, S, M,
Msb:) so says Zj, (T, M,) and in like manner
say Kh and Sb: (T:) or punishment (Yoo, Lth,
T, M, K) thereof: (Lth, T, M:) and ↓ إِثَامٌ and
↓ مَأْثَمٌ signify the same; (M, K;) the latter like
مَقْعَدٌ. (TA. [In the CK this is written مَأثِم.])
So in the Kur [xxv. 68], يَلْقَ أَثَامَا [He shall find
a requital, or recompense, or a punishment, of sin]:
(T, S, M:) in my opinion, [says ISd,] the correct
meaning is, he shall find the punishment of آثَام
[or sins]: but some say, the meaning is that which
here follows. (M.) ―
-b3-  A valley in Hell. (M, K.)
إِثَامٌ: see إِثْمٌ: ―
-b2-  and أَثَامٌ.
أَثُومَّ: see آثِمٌ; and أَثِيمٌ.
أَثِيمٌ: see آثِمٌ. ―
-b2-  Also A great, or habitual, liar;
or one who lies much; and so ↓ أَثُومٌ. (K.) So
in the Kur ii. 277: or it there signifies Burdened
with إثْم [or sin, &c.]. (TA.) In the Kur xliv. 44,
it means, accord. to Fr, The unrighteous, or
sinning; like ↓ آثِمٌ: (T:) or the unbeliever:
(TA:) or, accord. to Zj, in this instance, (M,) by
the اثيم is meant Aboo-Jahl. (M, K.)
-A2-  Also
The commission of إِثْم [sin, or crime, &c.,] much,
or frequently; and so ↓ أَثِيمَةٌ. (M, K.)
أَثِيمَةٌ: see أَثِيمٌ.
أَثَامٌ: see آثِمٌ.
آثِمٌ Falling into what is termed إِثمٌ [i. e. a sin,
or crime, &c.]; (S, Msb, * K; *) [sinning; committing a sin, or crime;] doing what is unlawful:
(K:) and in like manner, (S, Msb, K,) but having
an intensive signification, (Msb,) ↓ أَثِيمٌ, and
↓ أَثُومٌ, (S, M, Msb, K,) and ↓ أَثَّامٌ: (M, Msb, K:
[in the CK, erroneously, without teshdeed:]) the
pl. of the first of these three is أُثَمَآءُ; that of the
second, أُثُمٌ; and that of the third, أَثَّامُونَ. (M.)
See also أَثِيمٌ. ―
-b2-  آثِمَةٌ, (S,) and آثِمَاتٌ, (S, M, K,
[in the CK, erroneously, اَثِماتٌ.]) A she-camel,
(S,) and she-camels, slow, or tardy; (S, M, K;)
weary, fatigued, or jaded. (K. [In the CK, we
find مُعِيْباتٌ erroneously put for مُعْيِيَاتٌ.]) Some
pronounce it with ت. (Sgh.) [In like manner,]
↓ مُؤَاثِمٌ signifies That is slack, or slow, in pace, or
going; اَلَّذِى يَكْذِبُ فِى السَّيْرِ. (Sgh, K. [In Golius's Lex., as from the K, اَلَّذِى يُكَذِّبُ السَّيْرَ.
Both are correct, signifying the same.])
تَأْثَامٌ: see 1.
تَأْثِيمٌ: see 1.
مَأْثَمٌ: see إِثْمٌ, in two places: ―
-b2-  and see أَثَامٌ.
مَأْثُومٌ [Reckoned to have sinned, or the like;]
having a thing reckoned against him as an إِثْم:
(S:) or requited for what is termed إِثْمٌ. (Fr, T.)
مُوَاثِمٌ: see آثِمٌ.
