أَجِنَ]. (MF)

(PS:) [it probably received this last meaning,
and some others, in post-classical times: Golius
explains it as meaning “ lagena, phiala, crater: ”
adding, “hinc vulgo Fingiána [i. e. فِنْجَانَة] calix
vocatur: item Urceus: hydria: [referring to
John ii. 6:] Vas dimidiœ seriœ simile, in quo
aqua et similia ponuntur: ” on the authority of Ibn-Maaroof: and, on the same authority, “Labrum

for beating used by the قَصَّار [or whitener of cloth,
in washing]: but better without ء, [written مِيجَنةٌ,]
