S, or a man, K) to his repast, or banquet; (S, K;)

[or يُؤْدِبُ], (AZ, S,) inf. n. إِيدَابٌ [originally
إِئْدَابٌ]. (AZ, S, K.) You say, أَدَبَ القَوْمَ, (S,)
or أَدَبَ عَلَى القَوْمِ, aor. as above, (T,) He invited
the people to his repast. (T, S.) And أَدَبَهُمْ عَلَى
الأَمرِ He collected them together for the affair.
(A.) And جِيرَانَكَ لِتُشَاوِرَهُمْ ↓ أُودِبُ [I will collect

أَدْبٌ is The act of inviting. (T.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,]
أَدَبٌ, aor.
اَدِبَ; (Msb, K;) or أَدِبَ, aor.
اَدَبَ; (so in a
copy of the M;) inf. n. أَدْبٌ, (M, Mgh, Msb,) or
أَدَبٌ; (K;) He made a repast, or banquet, (M,
Msb, K,) and invited people to it; (Msb;) as
also ↓ آدَبَ, (M,) aor. and inf. n. as above:
(TA:) or he collected and invited people to his
repast. (Mgh.) ―
-b3-  [Hence also, as will be seen
below, voce أَدَبٌ] أَدَبَهُ, aor.
اَدِبَ, inf. n. أَدْبٌ, He
taught him the discipline of the mind, and the
acquisition of good qualities and attributes of
the mind or soul; (Msb;) and ↓ أدّبهُ, [inf. n.
تَأْدِيبٌ, signifies the same;] he taught him what
is termed أَدَب [or good discipline of the mind
and manners, &c.; i. e. he disciplined him, or
educated him, well; rendered him well-bred, wellmannered, polite; instructed him in polite accomplishments; &c.]: (S, M, A, Mgh, K:) or
the latter verb, inf. n. تَأْدِيبُ, signifies he taught
him well, or much, the discipline of the mind,
and the acquisition of good qualities and attributes
of the mind or soul: and hence, this latter also
signifies he disciplined him, chastised him, corrected him, or punished him, for his evil conduct;
because discipline, or chastisement, is a means
of inviting a person to what is properly termed
الأَدَبُ. (Msb.)

أَدَبٌ, so termed because it invites men to the

evil, (T, Mgh,) signifies Discipline of the mind;

soul: (Msb:) or every praiseworthy discipline
by which a man is trained in any excellence: (AZ,

manners; good education; good breeding; good
manners; politeness; polite accomplishments:]

mind, manners, address, and speech]: and a good
manner of taking or receiving [what is given or
offered or imparted, or what is to be acquired]:

the mind or soul, and the doing of generous or
honourable actions: (El-Jawáleekee:) or the

and actions: or the holding, or keeping, to those

below one: (Towsheeh:) or a faculty which preserves him in whom it exists from what would
disgrace him: (MF:) it is of two kinds, أَدَبُ
النَّفْسِ [which embraces all the significations explained above], and أَدَبُ الدَّرْسِ [which signifies
the discipline to be observed in the prosecution of
study, by the disciple with respect to the preceptor,
and by the preceptor with respect to the disciple:
see ‘Haji Khalfæ Lexicon,’ Vol. I. p. 212]:
(S, Btl, Mgh:) [also deportment, or a mode of
conduct or behaviour, absolutely; for one speaks
of good أَدَب and bad أَدَب:] the pl. is آدَابٌ
[which is often employed, and so is the sing. also,
as signifying the rules of discipline to be observed
in the exercise of a function, such as that of a
judge, and of a governor; and in the exercise of
an art, such as that of the disputer, and the orator,

الأَدَبُ: which is also used to signify polite literature: but in this sense, and like wise] as applied to
the sciences relating to the Arabic language, [or

↓ العُلُومُ الأَدَبِيَّاتُ,] الأَدَبُ is a post-classical term,
innovated in the time of El-Islám. (El-Jawá-
leekee.)

مَأْدُبَةٌ A repast, or banquet, to which guests are

made on account of a wedding: (M, K:) as also
↓ مَأْدُبَةٌ, (S, M, Msb, K,) or, accord. to A 'Obeyd,
this latter has a different signification, as will be
seen below, (TA,) and ↓ مَأْدُبَةُ, (IJ,) and ↓ أُدْبَةٌ:
(M, K:) pl. مَآدِبُ. (S.) In a trad., the Kur-án
is called مَأْدُبَةُ اللّٰهِ فِى الأَرْضِ, or ↓ مَأْدَبَة; and
A 'Obeyd says that, if we read مأدُبة, the meaning
is, God's repast which He has made in the earth,
and to which He has invited mankind; but if we
read مأدَبة, this word is of the measure مَفْعَلَةٌ from
الأَدَبُ, [and the meaning is, a means which God
has prepared in the earth for men's learning good
discipline of the mind, &c.; it being a noun
similar to مَثْرَاةٌ and مَكْثَرَةٌ &c.:] El-Ahmar, however, makes both words synonymous. (T, M, *
