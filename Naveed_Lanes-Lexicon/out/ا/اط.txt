and أَطٌّ, (TA,) It produced, made, gave, emitted,
or uttered, a sound, noise, voice, or cry; (S, K;)
[and particularly, it creaked; and it moaned;]
said of a camel's saddle, (S, * K, [in the CK,
الرَّجُلُ is put by mistake for الرَّحْلُ ]) [and particularly of a new camel's saddle,] and the like,
(K,) such as a [plaited or woven girth called]
نِسْع and of everything of which the sound
resembles that of a new camel's saddle, (TA,) and
of a palm-trunk, and of a tree of the kind called
سِدْر, (S TA,) or of the kind called سَرْح, (TA,)
and of a cane or reed on the occasion of its being
straightened, [in which instance it is said to be
tropical, but if so it is tropical in several other
instances,] and of a bow, (TA,) and of the belly
by reason of emptiness, (S,* TA,) and, in a trad.
of Aboo-Dharr, (tropical:)  of heaven, or the sky, notwithstanding there being [really] no أَطِيط in this
instance, for it is meant to denote [the presence
of] multitude, and confirmation of the majesty of
God. (TA.) [It is also said of other things, as
will be shown by phrases here following, and by
explanations of أَطِيطٌ below.] You also say, أَطَّتِ
الإِبِلُ, (K,) aor. as above, inf. n. أَطِيطٌ, (TA,)
The camels moaned by reason of fatigue, or
uttering their yearning cry to their young, (K,
TA,) and sometimes by reason of fulness of their
udders with milk. (TA.) And لَا آتِيكَ مَا أَطَّتِ الإِبِلُ
I will not come to thee as long as camels utter cries
[or moan] by reason of the heaviness of their loads.
(S.) And لَا أَفْعَلُ ذٰلِكَ مَا أَطَّتِ الإِبِلُ, meaning
I will not do that ever. (TA.) And مَا لَنَا بَعِيرٌ يَئِطُّ
We have not a camel that moans, or cries; meaning we have not any camel; for the camel cannot
but do so. (TA, from a trad.) [See also أَطِيطٌ,
below.] And أَطَّتْ لَهُ رَحِمِى (tropical:)  [My feeling of
relationship, or sympathy of blood,] became
affected with tenderness, or compassion, and became moved, [or rather pleaded,] for him [or in
his favour]: (K, TA:) and hence ↓التَّأَطُّطُ [inf. n.
of the verb in the syn. phrase تَأَطَّطَتْ لَهُ رَحِمِى].
(Sgh, TA.) And أَطَّتْ بِكَ الرَّحِمُ [The feeling of
relationship, or sympathy of blood, pleaded, or
hath pleaded, in thee;] i. e., inclined thee to
favour. (Ham p. 765.) [See another ex. voce
حَاسَّةٌ.]

نُسُوعٌ أُطَّطٌ [pl. of آطٌّ, part. n. of 1,] Creaking
[plaited, or woven, thongs]. (K.)
أَطِيطٌ [as explained in what here follows seems
to be properly an inf. n., though, like all inf. ns.,
it may be used as a subst.:] The sounding, or the
like, or the sound, or the like, [and particularly
the creaking, or creaking sound, and the moaning,
or moaning sound,] of a camel's saddle (S, K,
TA) when new; (TA;) and so ↓أَطٌّ of the litters
and saddles of camels when the riders are heavy
thereon; and the former, also, of a door; said, in
a trad., of the gate of paradise, by reason of its
being crowded; (TA;) and of a plaited or woven
thong when stretching; (Ez-Zejjájee, TA;) and

reason of hunger, (K,) or by reason of vehement
hunger; (TA;) and of camels, (S, K,) by reason
of their burdens, (K,) or by reason of the heaviness of their burdens; (S;) and the prolonging
of the cries of camels: (TA:) but 'Alee Ibn-
Hamzeh says that the cry of camels is termed
رُغَآءٌ, and that أَطِيطٌ signifies the sounding, or
sound, of their bellies, or insides, by reason of
repletion from drinking. (IB, TA.) أَهْلٌ صَهِيلٍ
ؤَأَطِيطٍ, occurring in a trad., means (assumed tropical:)  Possessors
of horses and of camels. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also (assumed tropical:) Hunger, (K, TA,) itself, as well as the sound of the
bowels or belly by reason thereof: from EzZejjájee. (TA.)
أَطَّاطٌ Sounding much; noisy; (K, TA;) having
a sound: applied [to any of the things mentioned
above in the explanations of أَطَّ and أَطِيطٌ; and]
to a hide; and to a camel repleted with drink;
and to a road: fem. with ة: which, applied to a
woman, signifies one whose فَرْج has a sound
إِذَا جُومِعَتْ. (TA.)
