and with teshdeed and fet-h to the و, and with
the ه quiescent, (TA,) [or,] accord. to Aboo-
Tálib, آوَّهْ, with medd, thus pronounced by the
vulgar, is wrong, (T in art. او,) and ↓ أَوَّاه, and
↓ أَوُّوه, [in both of which, and in some other forms
which follow, it is doubtful whether the ه be

(TA,) [Ah! or alas!] a word imitative of the
voice, cry, or exclamation, of the مُتَأَهِّه; (Az and
TA in explanation of آهِ;) [i. e.] a word expressive
of pain, grief, sorrow, lamentation, complaint, or
moaning; (S, Mgh, Msb, K, TA;) denoting the
prolongation of the voice with complaint: (S,
TA, after أَوَّهْ or آوَّهْ:) sometimes, also, a man
says آهِ from a motive of affection, or pity, or
compassion, and of impatience: (Az, TA:) [and
it is also said that] آهًا is a word expressive of
grief or lamentation, or of most intense grief
or lamentation or regret; [that] it is put in
the accus. case as being used in the manner
of inf. ns.; and [that] the hemzeh is originally
و: but IAth says, آهًا is a word expressive of
pain, grief, sorrow, lamentation, complaint, or
moaning, used in relation to evil, like as وَاهًا
is used in relation to good: (TA in art. اه:)
and آوَّهْ and آوِ and آوٍ are cries uttered to horses,
to make them return. (ISh and TA in art. اوى.
See 2 in that art. in the present work.) You say,
آهِ مِنْ كَذَا [Ah, or alas, on account of, or for,
such a thing!]; (S, Msb;) and in like manner,
أَوْهِ [&c.], followed by مِنْ, and by لِ, (S, TA,)
and by عَلَى. (TA.) [See also أَوِّ in art. او.]
آهَةٌ a subst. from تَأَوَّهَ; occurring in the saying
of El-Muthakkib El-'Abdee,
إِذَا مَاقُمْتُ أَرْحَلُهَا بِلَيْلٍ
تَأَوَّهُ آهَةَ الرَّجُلِ الحَزِينِ
[When I arise to saddle her, by night, she moans
with the moaning of the sorrowful man]: (S,
ISd:) ISd says that, in his opinion, the subst. is
here put in the place of the inf. n., i. e. تَأَوُّه: (TA:)
but some recite the verse differently, saying, أَهَّةَ,
from أَهَّ meaning تَوَجَّعَ: (S:) and some say,
تَهَوَّهُ هَاهَةَ. (TA.) And hence the saying, in imprecating evil on a man, آهَةً لَكَ [May God cause
moaning to thee!], and أَوَّةً لَكَ, with the ه suppressed, and with teshdeed to the و. (S.) [See
also أَوَّةٌ in art. او.] And see آهِ above.
-A2-  [Also]
Measles: thus in the phrase, used in imprecating
evil on a man, آهَةً وَمَاهَةً [May God cause] measles
and small-pox [to befall thee]! (K, * TA,) mentioned by Lh on the authority of Aboo-Khálid.
(TA.)

from a motive of affection, or pity, or compassion,
and fear: or mourning, or sorrowing, much, or
often: (TA:) or compassionate; tender-hearted:
or often praying, or frequent in prayer: (K, *
TA:) or one who celebrates the praises of God,
or praises Him greatly, or glorifies Him: or who
praises much, or often: or who abases himself, or
addresses himself with earnest supplication, [to
God], confident of his prayer's being answered:
(TA:) or one having certain knowledge (K, TA)
of his prayer's being answered: (TA:) or inviting
much, or often, to what is good: (TA:) or skilled
in the law: or a believer; so in the Abyssinian
