حوب1
حَابَ, (Msb, K,) sec. pers. حُبْتُ, (S,) aor.
يَحُوبُ, (S, Msb,) inf. n. حَوْبٌ (S, Msb, K) and
حَوْبَةٌ and حِيَابَةٌ, (S, K, accord. to one copy of
the K حِيَابٌ,) and حِيبَةٌ (TA) and حُوبٌ; (K;)
or this last is a simple subst.; or, as some say, it
and حَوْبٌ are two dial. vars.; that with damm,
of the dial. of El-Hijáz; and that with fet-h,
of the dial. of Temeem; (Msb;) accord. to Zj,
that with damm signifies “ sin, or crime; ” and
that with fet-h, the “ act ” of a man; [i. e. the
“ act of committing a sin, or crime; ”] (TA;)
He sinned; committed a sin, or crime; did what
was unlawful; (S, Msb, K;) بِكَذَا [by such a
thing]. (S, K.) ―
-b2-  Also, aor. as above, [inf. n.
not mentioned,] He, or it, became in an evil condition, or state. (TA.) ―

تحوّب He abstained from, shunned, or
avoided, sin, or crime; put it away from himself:
(A 'Obeyd, S, K, TA:) he applied himself to acts,
or exercises, of devotion; became devout, or a
devotee. (IJ, TA.) Here the form تَفَعَّلَ is deprived of the radical signification, as in the cases
of the syn. words تَأَثَّمَ and تَحَنَّثَ; though its
property is oftener to confirm the radical signification. (TA. [See تحنّث.]) You say, تحوّب
مِنْ كَذَا He abstained from such a thing as a
sin, or crime. (A 'Obeyd, S, TA. [See also
another explanation below.]) ―
-b2-  He humbled himself in his prayer, or supplication. (TA.) ―
-b3-  He
expressed pain, grief, or sorrow; lamented, or
complained. (S, K, * TA.) And تحوّب مِنْ كَذَا

sorrow, or lamented, or complained, by reason of
such a thing. (TA. [See another explanation
above.]) ―
-b4-  He cried out, expressing pain or
grief or sorrow, or lamenting, or complaining:
he cried aloud, or vehemently, in prayer, or supplication. (TA.) He wept, in impatience, or
sorrow, and with loud crying: and sometimes,
in a general sense, he cried out, or aloud, (TA.)
―
-b5-  He (a jackal) cried, or howled: because his
cry is like that of a person expressing pain or
grief or sorrow, or lamenting, or complaining,
as though he were writhing from the pain of
hunger or beating. (S, TA.)

a cry by which a male camel is chidden, (Lth,
IAth, K,) to urge him on; (Lth, TA;) like as
a she-camel is by the cry حَلْ and حَلِ and حَلِى:
the first form (حَوْبِ) is that used by the Arabs
[in general]; but the other forms are allowable:
حَوْبْ حَوْبْ also occurs, with the ب quiescent;
and حَوْبًا حَوْبًا occurs in a trad., in the same sense:
also, لَا مَشَيْتُ ↓ حَبْ and ↓ حَبِ and ↓ حَابْ and
↓ حَابِ [On! mayest thou not walk, or mayest
thou not be rightly directed; حب &c. being syn.
with حَوْبِ, and followed by an imprecation].

milk much diluted with water, wherefore tardiness? a prov., applied to him who delays the

called from the cry حَوْبِ, by which he is urged;

↓ وَاغْسِلْ حَوْبَتِى (T, TA) i. e. [O my Lord, accept
my repentance, and wash away] my sin, or crime.
