him therein: (see 6:) or] I proposed to him an

دَاعَيْتُهُ فَغَلَبْتُهُ: (S:) so in the handwriting of

[or proposed enigmas, one to another: or contended, one with another, in proposing an enigma,
or enigmas: (see 3:)] from حِجًى [or حِجًا]
meaning “ intelligence. ” (Har p. 189.) You say,
يَتَحَاجَوْنَ بِأُحْجِيَّةٍ [They try one another with an
enigma: or contend, one with another, in proposing an enigma]: (S, TA:) التَّحَاجِى signifying

-A2-  Bubbles upon water,
arising from the drops of rain: pl. [or rather
coll. gen. n.] of ↓ حَجَاةٌ: (S, K: [in the CK,
erroneously, حِجاة:]) the latter word, which is
like حَصَاةٌ, is explained by Az as signifying a
bubble that rises upon water, like a flask; and as
having for its pl. حَجَوَاتٌ: and the same word
(حجاة) signifies also a pool of water, itself, such
as is left by a torrent. (TA.)
-A3-  See also حَجِىٌّ.
-A4-  حَجَا is also used, by poetic license, for حَجَاج,
q. v. (TA in art. حج.)
حَجٍ: see حَجِىٌّ.

means لَا جِئٌ لَهُمْ [i. e. Verily he is betaking himself for refuge, or protection, to the sons of such

حِجًا or حِجًى Intelligence, or understanding;
(S, Msb, K;) sagacity, or skill and knowledge:
(K:) [said to be] from حَجَا meaning “ he, or it,

withholds, a man from doing that which is bad,
or corrupt. (TA.)
-A2-  And i. q. مِقْدَارٌ [Quantity,
measure, &c.]: pl. أَحْجَآءٌ. (K.)
-A3-  See also حَجًا.
-A4-  [Also said by Golius, as on the authority of
J, to signify “ an enigma,” as though syn. with
أُحْجِيَّةٌ; but I have not found it in this sense in
any copy of the S, nor in any other lexicon.]
حَجَاةٌ: see حَجًا.
حَجْوَى a subst. signifying مُحَاجَاةٌ [i. e. A
contention in intelligence &c.; and particularly,
in trying with an enigma or enigmas; in proposing an enigma or enigmas; or simply the
proposal of an enigma; see 3]; (T, TA;) the
subst. denoted by حَاجَيْتُهُ فَحَجَوْتُهُ; (K;) [or
rather by the verb حَاجَيْتُ, agreeably with the
foregoing explanation from the T;] as also ↓ حُجَيَّا,
(S, K, TA,) with a dammeh, (K, TA,) and with
teshdeed of the ى; (TA; [in some copies of the
K erroneously written حُجْيُا;]) and ↓ أُحْجِيَّةٌ:
(S:) or ↓ حُجَيًّا is the dim. of حَجْوَى: (T, TA:)
and ↓ أُحْجِيَّةٌ signifies a saying of which the meaning differs from the letter, as also ↓ أُحْجُوَّةٌ, (K,)
but احجيّة is preferable, (T, TA,) and كَلِمَةٌ
↓ مُحْجِيَةٌ, (K,) like مُحْسِنَةٌ; (TA; [in the CK,
erroneously, مُحْجِيَّةٌ;]) [i. e.] ↓ أُحْجِيَّةٌ signifies
an enigma; a riddle; (MA, PS, TK;) and so
↓ حُجَيَّا; (PS;) or a question put to one with the
view of causing him to make a mistake; (TA;)
and is from حِجًى [or حِجًا] meaning “ intelligence,” because مُحَاجَاةٌ is like a vying, or contending, in intelligence: (Har p. 9:) the pl. of
↓ أُحْجِيَّةٌ is أَحَاجِىُّ and أَحَاجٍ, (MA, and Har ubi
suprà,) agreeably with a general rule relating to
words of its measure, as أُثْفِيَّةٌ and أُمْنِيَّةٌ. (Seer,
in Har ubi suprà.) One says, مَاكَانَ ↓ حُجَيَّاكَ
كَذَا وَكَذَا [The question of contention with thee
in trying thine intelligence by an enigma, or the
enigma proposed to thee, is, What is, or was,
such a thing, and such a thing?]: it means a
certain game, and a question put with the view of
causing one to make a mistake: A 'Obeyd says,
It is like their saying, Disclose what is in my
hand, and thou shalt have such a thing. (S.)
One says also, فِى هٰذَا ↓ أَنَا حُجَيَّاكَ, meaning مَنْ
يُحَاجِيكَ [i. e. I am he who contends with thee in
intelligence, or in trying with an enigma, &c.,
respecting this thing]. (S.) And ↓ بَيْنَهُمْ أُحْجِيَّةٌ
يَتَحَاجَونَ بِهَا [Between them is a contention in
intelligence, or in proposing enigmas, or between
them is an enigma, with which they try one another]. (S.)
هُوَحَجِىٌّ بِهِ He is adapted, disposed, apt,
meet, suited, suitable, fitted, fit, competent, or
proper, for it; or worthy of it; as also ↓ حَجٍ,
(S, M, K, TA,) of which the pl. is حَجُونَ; (TA;)
and ↓ حَجًى, (S, M, K, TA,) which last has no
fem. nor dual nor pl. form, (S, M,) retaining the
same form as fem. and dual and pl.: (M:) and
in like manner you say, أَنْ يَفْعَلَ ذٰلِكَ ↓ إِنَّهُ لَمَحْجَاةٌ
Verily he is adapted, &c., to do that; (S, K; *) and
إِنَّهَا لَمَحْجَاةٌ; and إِنَّهُمْ لَمَحْجَاةٌ. (S.) ―
-b2-  حَجِىٌّ is
also syn. with حَرِيصٌ [Vehemently desirous, eager,
&c.]. (KL.)
حُجَيَّا: see حَجْوَى, in five places.
-A2-  Respecting
this word in the phrase حثجْ حُجَيَّاكَ, see حَاجَةٌ (in
art. حوج), near the end of the paragraph.
أحْجَى More, and most, adapted, disposed, apt,
meet, suited, suitable, fitted, fit, competent, proper,
or worthy: (TA, Ham p. 523:) so in the saying,
هُوَ أَحْجَى أَنْ يَكُونَ كَذَا [He is more, or most,
adapted, &c., to be thus; or worthy of being
thus]: (TA:) and فُلَانٌ أَحْجَى بِكَذَا [Such a one
is more, or most, adapted, &c., for such a thing;
or worthy of it]. (Ham ubi suprà.) Hence, in
a trad., مَعَاشِرُ هَمْدَانَ أَحْجَى حَىٍّ بِالكُوفَةِ [The
companies of Hemdán are the most worthy tribe
in El-Koofeh]: or, as some say, the meaning is,
the most intelligent tribe. (TA.)
أُحْجُوَّةٌ: see حَجْوَى.
أُحْجِيَّةٌ: see حَجْوَى, in five places.
مَحْجًى: see حَجًا.
مُحْجٍ Niggardly, tenacious, or avaricious.
