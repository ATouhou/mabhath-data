حب1
حَبَّ [signifying He, or it, was, or became,
loved, beloved, an object of love, affected, liked,
or approved, is originally حَبُبَ or حَبِبَ]. You
say, حَبَّ إِلَىَّ هٰذَا الشَّىْءُ, [aor.
حَبُ3َ or
حَبَ3َ,] inf. n.
حُبٌّ, This thing was, or became, an object of love
to me. (K. [The meaning is there indicated, but
not expressed. In the CK, الشَّىءَ is erroneously
put for الشَّىْءُ.]) And حَبُبْتُ إِلَيْهِ I became loved,
beloved, or an object of love, to him: [said to be]
the only instance of its kind except شَرُرْتُ and
لَبُبْتُ. (K.) And مَا كُنْتَ حَبِيبًا وَلَقَدْ حَبِبْتَ, with
kesr, Thou wast not loved, and thou hast become
loved. (S.) See also 5. ―
-b2-  حَبَّ, formed from
حَبُبَ, by making the former ب quiescent and incorporating it into the latter, is also a verb of
praise [signifying Beloved, lovely, pleasing, charming, or excellent, is he, or it]; (TA;) and so حُبَّ,
[which is more common,] formed from the same,
by incorporating the former ب into the latter
after transferring the dammeh of the former to the
ح. (ISk, S, TA.) A poet says,
وَزَادَهُ كَلَفًا فِى الحُبِّ أَنْ مَنَعَتْ
وَحَبَّ شَيْئًا الَى الانْسَانِ مَا مُنِعَا
[And her denying increased his devotion in love:
for lovely, as a thing, to man, is that which is
denied]. (TA.) And Sá'ideh says,
هَجَرَتْ غَضُوبُ وَحَبَّ مَنْ يَتَجَنَّبُ
وَعَدَتْ عَوَادٍ دُونَ وَلْيِكَ تَشْعِبُ
[Ghadoob hath forsaken thee, (and lovely is the
person who withdraweth far away,) and obstacles
in the way of thy drawing near have occurred to
separate thee and her]. (S, TA.) [See also حَبَّذَا,
below.] ―
-b3-  [Both are also verbs of wonder.] You
say, حَبَّ بِفُلَانٍ, (As, S, and so in copies of the
K,) and حُبَّ, (I 'Ak p. 236, [where both forms
are mentioned as correct,] and so in the CK,)
How beloved, or lovely, &c., is such a one (As,
S, K) to me! (As, S.) [See also 4.] A'Obeyd
and Fr read this حَبَّ, saying that it means حَبُبَ
بفلان, and that the former ب is rendered quiescent by the suppression of its dammeh, and incorporated into the latter. (S, * TA.)
-A2-  See also
4, in two places.
-A3-  Also حَبَّ, [aor., accord. to

حبّبهُ إِلَىَّ He, or it, [rendered him, or it,

pleasure in, him, or it. (K.) You say, حبّبهُ إِلَىَّ
إِحْسَانُهُ [His beneficence made him an object of
love to me]. (A, TA.) And حَبَّبَ اللّٰهُ إِلَيْهِ الإِيمَانَ
[God made faith lovely to him]. (A, TA.) And

approved, or took pleasure in, one another.] And

manner with him, or to him. (A, TA.) ―

and ↓ حَبَّهُ, (S,) first pers. حَبَبْتُهُ, (Msb, K,) aor.
حَبِ3َ,
which is anomalous, (S, Msb, K,) the regular
aor. being
حَبُ3َ, which is unused, (Msb,) [said to
be] the only instance of a trans. verb whose
second and third radical letters are the same
having the measure يَفْعِلُ as that of its aor. without having also the measure يَفْعُلُ, (S,) and
therefore by some disapproved, as not chaste, and
disallowed by Az, though he allows the pass.

simple subst., (Msb,) and حِبٌّ; (K;) and [↓ حَبَّهُ,]

حَبَ3َ; and ↓ حَابّهُ, inf. n. حِبَابٌ,
of the dial. of Hudheyl; (Msb;) and ↓ استحبّهُ;

him, or it, above another, or others; preferred
him, or it, to another, or others. (K, A, * TA.)
مَا أَحَبْتُ ذٰلِكَ, in the dial. of the tribe of Suleym,
is for ما أَحْبَبْتُهُ [I loved not, or liked not, that];
like ظَنْتُ for ظَنَنْتُ, and ظَلْتُ and ظِلْتُ for
ظَلِلْتُ. (Lh, TA.) [أُحِبُّ أَنْ يَكوُنَ كَذَا may be
rendered I would that it were thus, or that such
a thing were.] It is said of Ohod, in a trad.,
هُوَ جَبَلٌ يُحِبُّنَا وَنُحِبُّهُ, meaning It is a mountain
whose inhabitants love us, and whose inhabitants we
love: or it may mean we love the mountain itself,
because it is in the land of people whom we love.
(IAth, TA.) And one says فِى سَاعَةٍ يُحِبُّهَا
الطَّعَامُ for يُحَبُّ فِيهَا [In an hour, or a time, in
which food is loved, or liked]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  مَا أَحَبَّهُ
إِلَىَّ i. q. حَبَّ بِهِ [How beloved, lovely, pleasing,
charming, or excellent, is he, or it, to me!]; (As,
S, K, * TA;) and so أَحْبِبْ إِلَىَّ بِهِ. (A, TA.) [De
Sacy, in his Gram. Ar., sec. ed., ii. 221, mentions
the saying, مَا أَحَبَّ المُؤْمِنَ للّٰهِ وَمَا أَحَبَّهُ إِلَى اللّٰهِ,
as meaning How greatly does the believer love
God! and how great an object of love is he to
God!]
-A2-  احبّ, (S, K,) inf. n. as above, (S,)
also signifies He (a camel) kneeled and lay down,
and would not spring up: (K:) or was restive:
or kneeled and lay down: (S:) or was afflicted
by a fracture, or disease, and would not move

(K.) ―
-b4-  He (an ass &c.) became filled with

says, شَرِبَتِ الإِبِلُ حَتَّى حَبَّبَتْ The camels drank
until they were satiated. (S.)

of the cattle, or camels &c., retained the water

[the periods of] الطَّرْف and الجَبْهَة [the ninth and
tenth of the Mansions of the Moon, which, in
central Arabia, about the commencement of the
era of the Flight, took place on the 12th of
August, O. S., (see مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ, in art. نزل,)]
when Canopus rises with them. (TA. [الصَّرْفَة is
there put for الطَّرْف; but evidently by a mistake
of a copyist. There is also another mistake,
though a small one, in the foregoing passage: for
Canopus rises, in central Arabia, after الطرف,
and before الجبهة; and rose aurorally, in that
latitude, about the commencement of the era of
the Flight, on the 4th of August, O. S.])

to beans, (as in the Mgh in art. بقل,) and peas
and the like; and kernels; and] the stones of
grapes, dates, pomegranates, and the like: (Mgh
voce عجَمٌ:) by some it is applied even [to berries; as, for instance,] to grapes: you say حَبَّةٌ
مِنْ عِنَبٍ, as well as مِنَ البُرِّ, and مِنَ الشَّعِيرِ, and
the like: (TA:) [and hence, to beads: (see
حِبٌّ:)] the pl. (of حَبٌّ, Msb) is حُبُوبٌ (S, Msb,
K) and حُبَّانٌ, like تُمْرَانٌ, (K,) pl. of تَمْرٌ; (TA;)
and (of حَبَّةٌ, Msb) حَبَّاتٌ (Msb, K) and حِبَابٌ,
[or this is pl. of حَبٌّ also,] like كِلَابٌ as pl. of

[Hence likewise,] حَبٌّ also signifies Pimples, or
small pustules: [so in the present day: and any
similar small extuberances: a coll. gen. n.: n. un.
with ة.] (S and K * in art. حثر.)
حُبٌّ Love; affection; syn. وُدٌّ, (A,) or وِدَادٌ;
(K;) inclination of the nature, or natural disposition, towards a thing that pleases, or delights;
(Kull p. 165;) contr. of بُغْضٌ: (Mgh, TA:) حُبٌّ

be syn. with حُبٌّ and in the K to be syn. with
مَحَبَّةٌ, and it is used as an inf. n. in an ex. cited
voce دَاحٌ in art. دوح,] and ↓ حُبَابٌ (S, K) and
↓ حِبَابٌ (K) and ↓ مَحَبَّةٌ (S) signify the same;
(S, K;) i. e., as above. (K.) The degrees of
حُبّ are as follow: first, هَوًى, the “ inclining of
the soul, or mind; ” also applied to the “ object
of love itself: ” then, عَلَاقَةٌ, “love cleaving to the
heart; ” so termed because of the heart's cleaving
to the object of love: then, كَلَفٌ, “violent, or
intense, love; ” from كُلْفَةٌ signifying “ difficulty,
or distress, or affliction: ” then, عِشْقٌ, [“ amorous
desire; ” or “ passionate love; ”] in the S, “excess
of love; ” and in the language of the physicians,
“ a kind of melancholy: ” then, شَغَفٌ, “ardour
of love, accompanied by a sensation of pleasure; ”
like لَوْعَةٌ and لَاعِجٌ; the former of which is
“ ardour of love; ” and the latter, “ardent love: ”
then, جَوًى, “inward love; ” and “ violence of
amorous desire,” or “ of grief, or sorrow: ” then,
تَتَيُّمٌ, “a state of enslavement by love: ” then
تَبْلٌ, “lovesickness: ” then, وَلَهٌ, “distraction, or
loss of reason, in love: ” and then, هُيَامٌ “ a state
of wandering about at random in consequence of
overpowering love. ” (Kull ubi suprà.) [Accord.
to the Msb, it is a simple subst.: but accord. to
the K, an inf. n.; and hence,] حُبًّا لِمَا أَحْبَبْتُمْ,
meaning أُحِبُّ حُبًّا [I love with loving, i. e. much,
what ye have loved]. (Har p. 186.) Hence the
phrase, وَكَرَامَةً ↓ نَعَمْ وَحُبَّةً [Yea; and with love
and honour will I do what thou requirest: or for
the sake of the love and honour that I bear thee:
or حبّة may be here used for حُبًّا to assimilate it
in termination to كرامة: see what follows]. (S,
TA.) Hence also the saying of Abu-l-' Atà EsSindee,
فَوَاللّٰهِ مَا أَدْرِى وَإِنِّى لَصَادِقٌ
أَدَآءٌ عَرَانِى مِنْ حُبَابِكِ أَمْ سِحْرُ
[And by God, I know not (and indeed I am
speaking truth) whether disease have befallen me
in consequence of love of thee, or enchantment]:
(S, TA:) but IB says that the reading best known
is ↓ مِنْ حِبَابِكِ; and that حِباب, here, may be an
inf. n. of حَابَبْتُهُ; or it may be pl. of حُبٌّ, like as
عِشاشٌ is of عُشٌّ; (TA;) or it may be an inf. n.
of حَبَبْتُهُ: some also read ↓ مِنْ حَبَابِكِ, with fet-h
to the ح, said to mean on account of the love of
thee, and of the main amount thereof: (Ham
p. 26:) and some read مِنْ جَنَابِكِ “ from thy
part ” [or “ from thee ”]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  See also
حَبِيبٌ.
-A2-  Also a Persian word, arabicized,
(AHát, S, Msb,) from خُنْب, (AHát, TA,) [or
خُبْ or خُپْ,] i. q. خَابِيَةٌ, (S, Msb,) A jar, (K,
MF,) whether large or small, used for preparing
wine: (MF:) or a large jar: (K:) or one for
water: (IDrd, TA:) or the four pieces of wood
upon which is placed a two-handled, or two-eared,
jar: (K, TA: [in the CK, by a misplacement
of words, this last signification is assigned to
حَبَاب:]) pl. [of pauc.] أَحْبَابٌ (K) and [of mult.]
حِبَابٌ and حِبَبَةٌ. (S, Msb, K.) From this last
signification is [said to be] derived the phrase
حُبًّا وَكَرَامَةً [pronounced حُبًّا وَكَرَامَهْ, lit. A jarstand and a cover will I give thee, or the like],
كرامة signifying the “ cover ” of a jar, (K, TA,)
whether of wood or of baked clay. (TA.) [If
this be the true derivation, the phrase may have
originated from a person's asking of another the
loan or gift of a jar, and the latter's replying
“ Yea; and I will give thee a jar-stand and a
cover; ” meaning “ I will do what thou requirest,
and more: ” but this phrase is now, and perhaps
was in early times, generally used, agreeably with
the more common significations of the two words,
in the sense assigned above to the phrase حُبَّةً
وَكَرَامَةً.]

-b2-  حَبَابٌ also signifies (tropical:)  Dew-drops; (A;)
the dew (IAth, K) that is on trees &c. in the
evening. (IAth, TA.) It is said in a trad., of
the inhabitants of Paradise, that their food shall
turn into a sweat like حباب المسْك, by which is
meant Musky dew: or, perhaps, musky bubbles.
(IAth, TA.)
حُبَابٌ: see حُبٌّ, in two places: ―
-b2-  and حَبِيبٌ.
-A2-  Also The serpent: (S, IAth, K:) or a serpent
not of a malignant species: (TA:) and the name
of a devil, (S, K,) accord. to some; (S;) but
said to be so only because a serpent is called
شَيْطَان. (A 'Obeyd, S, TA.) ―
-b2-  And a pl. [or
rather coll. gen. n.] of which the sing. [or n. un.]
is حُبَابَةٌ [accord. to the CK حُبَابَةُ], meaning A
certain black aquatic insect or small animal. (K.)
-A3-  أُمُّ حُبَابٍ (tropical:)  The present world; (K, TA;)
metonymically used in this sense. (TA.)
حِبَابٌ: see حُبٌّ, in two places:
-A2-  and حِبٌّ.
حَبِيبٌ A person loved, beloved, affected, liked,
or approved; (S, * A, Msb, * K;) as also ↓ مَحْبُوبٌ
and ↓ مُحَبٌّ, (S, Msb, K,) of which two the
former is generally used for the latter, (S, K, TA,)
in like manner as are used مَزْكُومٌ and مَحْزُونٌ
and مَجْنُونٌ and مَكْزُوزٌ and مَقْرُورٌ, each of which
has its proper verb of the measure فُعِلَ, (TA,)
and ↓ حِبٌّ (S, K) and ↓ حُبَابٌ and ↓ حُبًّةٌ, which
last is also applied to a female, and has for its
pl. حُبَبٌ: (K:) the fem. of حَبِيبٌ is with ة;
(Msb, K;) and so is that of ↓ مَحْبُوبٌ, (K, TA,)
[and that of ↓ مُحَبٌّ,] and that of ↓ حِبٌّ: (TA:)
the pl. of حَبِيبٌ is أَحِبَّآءُ, instead of حُبَبَآءُ, which
would be the reg. pl. but for the repetition of the
ب; and the pl. of حَبِيبَةٌ is حَبَائِبُ: (Msb:) the
pl. of ↓ حِبٌّ is أَحْبَابٌ [a pl. of pauc.] and حِبَّانٌ
(K) and حُبَّانٌ (MF) and حُبُوبٌ and حِبَبَةٌ and
↓ حُبٌّ, which last is rare (عَزِيزٌ) [as a pl.], or is a
quasi-pl. n. (K.) Though ↓ مُحَبٌّ is uncommon
it occurs in the following verse of 'Antarah:
وَلَقَدْ نَزَلْت فَلَا تَظُنّى غَيْرَهُ
مِنِّى بِمْنْزِلَةِ المُحَبِّ المُكْرَمِ
[And thou hast taken (and imagine not otherwise), in respect of me, i. e. of my heart, the
place of the beloved, the honoured; or become in
the condition of the beloved, &c.]. (T, TA.) ―
-b2-
Also, (IAar, KL, TA,) and ↓ حِبٌّ, (K, KL,) A
person loving; a lover; a friend; (KL;) i. q.
↓ مُحِبٌّ: (IAar, K, TA:) [fem. of each with ة:]
the pl. of the first (i. e. حبيب) is أَحْبَابٌ (TA)
[and أَحِبَّآءُ and أَحِبَّةٌ, mentioned by Golius as
from the S, but not in my copies of the S: both,
however, are correct: the former, the more common: the latter, a pl. of pauc.]. You say اِمْرَأَةٌ
لِزَوْجِهَا ↓ مُحِبَّةٌ and ↓ مُحِبٌّ [A woman loving to
her husband]. (Fr, S, K. *) ―
-b3-  أَبُو حَبِيبٍ The kid.
(Har p. 227.) ―
-b4-  الحَبِيبَةُ: see مُحَبٌّ.
حُبَاحِبٌ, (K,) or أَبُو حُبَاحِبٍ, (S,) [A kind of
fire-fly;] a fly that flies in the night, (K,) resembling fire, (S,) emitting rays like a lamp:
(K:) AHn says that حباحب and ابوحباحب
were both unknown to him, and that nothing
respecting them had been heard by him from the
Arabs; but that some people asserted the insect
thus called to be the يَرَاع, a moth that, when it
flies by night, no person not knowing it would
doubt to be a spark of fire: Aboo-Tálib says,
as on the authority of Arabs of the desert, that
حباحب is the name of a flying thing longer than
the common fly, and slender, that flies between
sunset and nightfall, resembling a spark of fire:
(TA:) or, accord. to As, it is a flying thing, like
the common fly, with a wing that becomes red;
when it flies appearing at a distance like a lighted
piece of fire-wood. (Har p. 500.) نَارُ الحُبَاحِبِ
(S, K) and نَارُأَبِى حُبَاحِبٍ and simply الحُبَاحِبُ
(S) mean The fire of the fly above mentioned:
or of El-Hobáhib or Aboo-Hobáhib: (TA:)
[for] El-Hobáhib, (S,) or Aboo-Hobáhib, (K,)
is said to have been a niggardly man, who never
lighted any but a faint fire, fearing to attract
guests, so that his fire became proverbial. (S, K.)
El-Kumeyt says, describing swords,
يَرَى الرَّاؤُونَ بِالشَّفَرَاتِ مِنْهَا
كَنَارِ أَبِى حُبَاحِبَ وَالظُّبِينَا
[The beholders see, in the sides of the blades
thereof, and the extremities, the semblance of the
fire of the fire-fly]: (S:) here the poet has made
حباحب imperfectly decl., regarding it as a fem.
[proper] name [of the fly above mentioned]. (TA.)
Or نارالحباحب (S, K) and simply الحباحب (S)
signify The fire that is struck by a horse's hoofs:
(Fr, S:) or the sparks of fire that are made to
fly forth in the air by the collision of stones:
or the sparks that fall from the pieces of wood
that are used for producing fire [by means of
friction]: (K:) or they are derived from حَبْحَبَةٌ,
(IAar, K,) signifying “ weakness,” (IAar, TA,)
[and their meaning is faint fire.] ―
-b2-  أُمُّ حُبَاحِبٍ
A flying insect resembling the [species of locust
called] جُنْدَب, (K, * TA,) spotted with yellow
and green: when people see it, they say, بَرِّدِى
يَا حُبَاحِبُ [Spread forth thy wings (بُرْدَيْكِ),
hobáhib]; whereupon it spreads its two wings,
which are adorned with red and yellow. (TA.)
حَبَّذَا, meaning حَبِيبٌ, as in the phrase حَبَّذَا
الأَمْرُ [Loved, beloved, affected, loved, or approved,
is the thing, or affair; or lovely, charming, or
excellent, is it]; (K;) and in حَبَّذَا زَيْدٌ [Loved,
beloved, &c., is Zeyd]; (S;) is composed of
حَبَّ, (Sb, Fr, S, K,) a verb of praise, in the
pret. form, invariable, originally حَبُبَ, (Fr, S,)
and ذَا, (Sb, Fr, S, K,) its agent, (S,) which
together constitute it a single word, (Sb, S, K,)
a noun, (Sb, K,) or occupying the place of a
noun, (S,) governing the noun [particularized
by praise] that follows it in the nom. case; (Sb,
S, K;) the place that it occupies in construction
making it virtually in the nom. case as an inchoative, and the noun that follows it being its
enunciative: (S:) [but see what follows.] It is
used in the same manner as a prov.; (Sb, K;)
[i. e., it is not altered to agree in number or
gender with the noun particularized by praise,
which follows it;] remaining the same when
used in the dual and pl. and fem. sense; so that
one says, حبّذا زَيْدٌ and الزَّيْدَانِ and الزَّيْدُونَ
and هِنْدٌ and أَنْتَ and أَنْتُمَا and أَنْتُمْ [&c.];
(Ibn-Keysán, TA;) and حبّذا امْرَأَةٌ, not حَبَّذِهِ
المَرْأَةُ; (Sb, S, K; *) which shows that the noun
that follows it may not be regarded as a substitute
for ذا: (S:) [but see what follows.] It is allowable, but bad, to say, زَيْدٌ حَبَّذَا. (TA.) [There
are, however, various opinions respecting حبّذا
and the noun that follows it.] Some hold that
حبّذا is a noun, composed of حَبَّ and ذا, and
is an inchoative, and that the noun particularized
by praise is its enunciative; or that the former is
an enunciative, and the latter an inchoative,
reversing the usual order: others hold that حَبَّ
is a verb in the pret. form; and ذا, its agent;
and that the noun particularized by praise may
be an inchoative, of which حبّذا is the enunciative; or it may be an enunciative of which the
inchoative is suppressed, so that حبّذا زَيْدٌ is for
حبّذا هُوَ زَيْدٌ [Loved, or beloved, &c., is this
person: he is Zeyd], or حبّذا المَمْدُوحُ زَيْدٌ [loved,
&c., is this person: the person praised is Zeyd]:
others hold that حبّذا is a pret. verb, composed
of حَبَّ and ذا, and that the noun following it
is its agent; but this is the weakest of opinions:
one also says, in dispraise, لَاحَبَّذَا زَيْدٌ. (I 'Ak
p. 235.)
حَابٌّ An arrow that falls [in the space] around
the butt: pl. حَوَابُّ. (K.)
أَحَبُّ [More, and most, loved, beloved, &c.
You say, هٰذَا أَحَبُّ إِلَىَّ مِنْ ذَاكَ This is more
an object of love, affection, liking, or approval,
or is more lovely, charming, or pleasing, to me
than that. And هُوَ أَحَبُّهُمْ إِلَىَّ He is the most
beloved of them to me.]
