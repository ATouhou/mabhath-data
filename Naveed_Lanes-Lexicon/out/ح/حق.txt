حق1
حَقَّ, aor.
حَقِ3َ (S, Msb, K, &c.) and
حَقُ3َ, (IDrd,
Msb, K,) [the latter irregular,] inf. n. حَقَّةٌ (K,
TA) and حَقٌّ (IDrd, TA) and حُقُوقٌ, (TA,)
i. q. صَارَ حَقًّا [i. e., accord. to the primary meaning of حَقٌّ, as explained below, on the authority
of Er-Rághib, It was, or became, suitable to the
requirements of wisdom, justice, right or rightness, truth, or reality or fact; or to the exigencies
of the case]: (TA:) it was, or became, just,
proper, right, correct, or true; authentic, genuine,
sound, valid, substantial, or real; established, or
confirmed, as a truth or fact: and necessitated,
necessary, requisite, or unavoidable; binding,
obligatory, incumbent, or due: syn. وَجَبَ; (T,
S, Msb, K, &c.;) and ثَبَتَ: (Msb, TA:) it was, or
became, a manifest and an indubitable fact or event;
as explained by IDrd in the Jm; (TA;) it happened, betided, or befell, surely, without doubt or
uncertainty. (K.) It is said in the Kur xxxvi. 6,
لَقَدْ حَقَّ القَوْلُ عَلَى أَكْثَرِهِمْ, i. e. The saying,
“ I will assuredly fill Hell with genii and men
together,” [Kur xi. 120 and xxxii. 13,] (Bd,) or
the sentence of punishment, (Jel,) hath become
necessitated [as suitable to the requirements of
justice, or as being just or right,] to take effect
upon the greater number of them; syn. وَجَبَ,
(Jel, TA,) and ثَبَتَ. (TA.) And this, namely,
ثَبَتَ, is the meaning of the verb in the phrase,
حَقَّ عَلَيْكَ القَضَآءُ [The sentence was, or, emphatically, is, necessitated as suitable to the requirements of justice to take effect upon thee; or it
was, or is, necessary, just, or right, that the
sentence should take effect upon thee]. (TA.)
[In like manner,] one says, يَحِقُّ عَلَيْكَ أَنْ تَفْعَلَ
كَذَا It is necessary for thee [as suitable to the
requirements of wisdom or justice or the like],
or incumbent on thee, or just or proper or right
for thee, that thou shouldst do such a thing.
(TA.) [Thus one says,] الحَقِيقَةُ مَا يَحِقُّ عَلَيْكَ
أَنْ تَحْمِيَهُ [The حقيقة is that which it is necessary
for thee &c., or that which it behooveth thee,
that thou shouldst defend it, or protect it]. (S, *
K.) Accord. to Sh, the Arabs said, حَقَّ عَلَىَّ أَنْ
أَفْعَلَ ذٰلِكَ and حُقَّ: but accord. to Fr, when you
say حَقَّ, you say عَلَيْكَ; and when you say حُقَّ,
you say لَكَ. (TA.) [Accordingly] one says,
حُقَّ لَكَ أَنْ تَفْعَلَ ذَا and حُقِقْتَ أَنْ تَفْعَلَهُ: both
mean the same: (Ks, S, K:) [i. e., each has one,
or the other, or both, of the meanings next following:] or the former means It was, or, emphatically, is, rendered حّقّ [or suitable to the
requirements of wisdom or justice &c.] for thee,
or necessary for thee, or incumbent on thee, or
just or proper or right for thee, [or it behooved
or behooves thee,] that thou shouldst do, or to
do, this, or that: and [the latter, or] حُقِقْتَ بِأَنْ
تَفْعَلَ, Thou wast, or, emphatically, art, rendered
حَقِيق [or adapted, disposed, apt, meet, suited,
suitable, fitted, fit, proper, competent, or worthy,]
that thou shouldst do, or to do, this, or that]:
(A, TA:) and in like manner, حُقَّتْ signifies in
the Kur lxxxiv. 2 and 5: (Bd, Jel: *) or حُقِقْتَ
بِأَنْ تَفْعَلَ may mean thou wast, or art, known
by the testimony of thy circumstances to be حَقِيق
&c. (A, TA.) And مَا كَانَ يَحُقُّكَ أَنْ تَفْعَلَهُ
[virtually] means the same as مَا حُقَّ لَكَ [best
rendered in this case It did not behoove thee
to do it]. (TA.) One says also, حَقَّ أَنْ تَفْعَلَ
[It was, or, emphatically, is, necessary &c. that
thou shouldst do or to do such a thing]: but they
did not say, حَقَقْتَ أَنْ تَفْعَلَ. (Fr, TA.) ―
-b2-  But
حَقَّ عَلَىَّ أَنْ تَفْعَلَ كَذَا means Thy doing so
distressed, or hath distressed, or afflicted, me;
or, emphatically, distresses, or afflicts, me; like
عَزَّ عَلَىَّ. (S and K and TA in art. عز.) And in
like manner, حَقَّ أَنَّكَ ذَاهِبٌ [or حَقَّ مَا أَنَّكَ ذَاهِبٌ]
means عَزَّ مَا أَنَّكَ ذَاهِبٌ [It is distressing to me
that thou art going away]. (TA in art. عز.)
And لَحَقَّ مَا is used in the same manner as لَعَزَّ مَا,
q. v. (A and TA in art. عز.) You say also,
حَقَّتِ الحَاجَةُ Want befell, or betided, or happened,
and was severe, or distressing: (Msb, TA:)
[which is said to be] from the phrase, حَقَّتِ
القِيَامَةُ, aor.
حَقُ3َ, The resurrection included, or shall
include, within its sphere [all] the created beings.
(Msb.)
-A2-  حَقَّتْ, aor.
حَقِ3َ, (K,) inf. n. حِقَّةٌ (S, *
Msb, K,) and حِقٌّ, (K,) or, accord. to ISd, it should
rather be حَقَاقَةٌ and حُقُوقَةٌ, because حِقَّةٌ is used
as an epithet, [as will be seen below,] and the
inf. n. in a case like this, by rule, should differ
from the epithet, (TA,) She (a camel) became
a حِقّ, or حِقَّة; i. e., entered the fourth year:
(K:) and ↓ أَحَقَّ, inf. n. إِحْقَاقٌ, he (a camel)
became a حِقّ: because, so they say, he is then
fit to be laden: (Msb:) and ↓ احقّت she (a
young camel) completed three years; (Aboo-Málik, K;) became a حِقَّة; (Ibn-'Abbád, K;)
like حَقَّتْ. (TA.) You say, هُوَ حَقٌّ بَيِّنُ الحِقَّةِ
[He is a حقّ, bearing evidence of being such]:
(S:) and هِىَ حِقٌّ (K) and حِقَّةٌ (Msb, K) بَيِّنَةُ
الحِقَّةِ [she is a حقّ or حقّة, bearing evidence
&c.]: (Msb:) [a phrase] to which a parallel
is scarcely known, (Msb,) or to which there is
no parallel (K) except أَسَدٌ بَيِّنُ الأَسَدِ [a lion
bearing evidence of being like a lion in boldness].
(TA.) ―
-b2-  حِقٌّ [as inf. n. of حَقَّتْ] also signifies
A she-camel's overpassing the days [corresponding
to those] in which she was covered [in the preceding year]: (K:) or her completing [the time
of] her pregnancy; as also ↓ اِسْتِحْقَاقٌ. (TA.)
―
-b3-  And حَقَّتْ and ↓ احقّت and ↓ استحقّت She
(a camel) became fat. (TA. [See also 8, last
signification.])
-A3-  حَقَّهُ, (K,) aor.
حَقُ3َ, inf. n. حَقٌّ,
(TA,) He, or it, rendered it [suitable to the
requirements of wisdom, justice, rightness, truth,
or reality or fact; or to the exigencies of the
case; (see the first of the significations in this
art.;) or] necessary, requisite, or unavoidable;
binding, obligatory, incumbent, or due; or just,
proper, or right; syn. أَوْجَبَهُ; (K;) [whence
حُقَّ لَكَ أَنْ تَفْعَلَ ذَا, explained above;] as also
↓ حقّقهُ (K) and ↓ احقّهُ; (S, K;) which last some
explain by صَيَّرَهُ حَقًّا [meaning as above; or he
rendered it true;] or صيّره حقًّا لَا شَكَّ فِيهِ [he
rendered it true, so that there was no doubt
respecting it]; as also حَقَّهُ, inf. n. حَقٌّ: and حَقَّهُ
signifies also he established it so that it became
true and undoubted in his estimation: (TA:)
or حَقَّهُ signifies, (S, Msb,) or signifies also, (K,)
he assured, or certified, himself of it; he ascertained it; he was, or became, sure, or certain,
of it; (A 'Obeyd, S, Msb, * K; *) and so ↓ تحقّقه
(A 'Obeyd, S, K) and ↓ احقّهُ: (S, Msb: *) or he
pronounced it, or held or believed it, to be established as a necessary truth or fact; as also
↓ احقّهُ: and ↓ حقّقهُ has a similar, but intensive,
signification: (Msb:) or ↓ احقّهُ signifies he
established it as true; or he judged, or decided,
it to be so: (TA: [contr. of أَبْطَلَهُ: see an ex.,
from the Kur viii., voce أَبْطَلَ:]) and ↓ حقّقهُ,
inf. n. تَحْقِيقٌ, signifies صَدَّقَهُ [as meaning he
verified it, or proved it to be true or veritable; or
he found it to be true or veritable; both of which
significations are of very frequent occurrence];
(S, K;) as also حَقَّهُ, inf. n. حَقٌّ: and accord.
to IDrd, ↓ حقّقهُ signifies [also] صَدَّقَ قَائِلَهُ [he
proved, or found, or pronounced, the sayer of
it to be ture]: and حقّق is also said to signify
he said, “This thing is the truth; ” like صَدَّقَ.
(TA.) You say, حَقَقْتُ عَلَيْهِ القَضَآءَ, aor.
حَقُ3َ, inf. n.
حَقٌّ, I necessitated the sentence [as suitable to
the requirements of justice] to take effect upon
him; or necessitated [as suitable &c.] the taking
effect of the sentence upon him; syn. أَوْجَبْتُهُ; as
also ↓ أَحْقَقْتُهُ, inf. n. إِحْقَاقٌ. (TA.) And ↓ أُحِقَّ
عَلَيْكَ القَضَآءُ The sentence was, or, emphatically,
is, necessitated [as suitable to the requirements
of justice] to take effect upon thee; syn. أُثْبِتَ.
(TA.) And حَقَقْتُ حَذَرَهُ, (S, K,) or حِذْرَهُ, (so
in one copy of the S,) aor. and inf. n. as above,
(S,) [I rendered his caution, or fear, necessary;
or justified it; meaning] I did that of which
he was cautious, or that which he feared; (S, K;)
as also حذره ↓ أَحْقَقْتُ: (S:) or, accord. to Az,
the latter only is right. (TA.) And حَقَقْتُ ظَنَّهُ;
(Ks, TA;) and ↓ حَقَّقْتُهُ, (Ks, S, TA,) inf. n.
تَحْقِيقٌ: (S:) both signify the same; (Ks, TA;)
i. e. صَدَّقْتُ; (S;) which means I found his
opinion to be true; (Ksh and Bd and Jel, in
xxxiv. 19;) or proved it to be true: (Ksh, ibid.:)
and so قَوْلَهُ his saying: (S:) and تَحْقِيقٌ signifies
[also] the strengthening, or confirming, a saying;
or making it strong, or firm. (KL.) And أَنَا
أَحَقُّ لَكُمْ هٰذَا الخَبَرَ I will know, or ascertain,
the truth, or real nature, of this piece of news
or information, for you. (TA.) And أَظُنُّهُ وَ لَا
أَحُقُّهُ [I think it, but I do not know the truth
of it, or am not certain of it]. (T in art. إِيَّا;
&c.) And حَقَقْتُ العُقْدَةَ, [written in the TA
without any syll. signs, so that it may be either
thus or ↓ حَقَّقْتُهُ; but it is most probably the
former, as the quasi-pass. is not تحقّقت, but
انحقّت: it signifies lit. I made the knot right,
or sure; meaning] (tropical:)  I tied, or made fast, or
tightened, the knot; (Ibn-'Abbád, TA;) or I
tied, or tightened, firmly the knot. (A, TA.)
―
-b2-
[He, or it, rendered him حَقِيق, i. e. adapted,
disposed, apt, meet, suited, suitable, fitted, fit,

signifies also The weaving a garment, or piece of

اِسْتَوْجَبَهُ: (S, Msb, K:) or these two verbs are
nearly the same; (TA;) [the former meaning
he was, or became, adapted, disposed, apt, meet,
suited, suitable, fitted, fit, competent, or proper,
for it; which is the most proper meaning of the
phrase صَارَ حَقِيقًا بِهِ, as well as of the verb استحقّ;
but this verb has also the former of these two
meanings.] When a man purchases a house, and
another lays claim to it, and establishes a just
evidence of his claim, and the judge decides for
him according to his evidence, one says of him,
قَدِ اسْتَحَقَّهَا عَلَى المُشْتَرِى [He has a right to it in
preference to the purchaser]; meaning that he is
to possess it in preference to the purchaser. (TA.)
And of a camel such as is termed حِقّ one
says, استحقّ أَنْ يُرْكَبَ [He was, or has become,
fit to be ridden], (K,) and أَنْ يُحْمَلَ عَلَيْهِ [to be
laden]: (S, Msb:) and استحقّ الضِّرَابَ [He was,
or has become, fit for covering]. (L, K.) ―

it, merited it, or required it.] And استحقّ إِثْمًا
He did what necessitated sin; (Ksh and Bd and
Jel in v. 106;) [was guilty of a sin;] and deserved its being said of him that he was a sinner;
(Ksh ibid.;) i. q. اِسْتَوْجَبَهُ. (TA.) And استحقّوا
They committed sins for which he who should
punish them would be excusable, because they deserved punishment; like أَوْجَبُوا, and أَعْذَرُوا, and
اِسْتَلَاطُوا. (IAar, TA in art. لوط.) ―
-b3-  استحقّت
إِبِلُنَا رَبِيعًا: see 4, last sentence. ―
-b4-  استحقّت النَّاقَةُ
لَقَاحًا The she-camel conceived, or became pregnant; and استحقّ لَقَاحُهَا [signifies the same].
(TA.) ―

R. Q. 1
حَقْحَقَ, inf. n. حَقْحَقَةٌ, He went the
pace, or in the manner, termed حَقْحَقَةٌ; (TA;)
which means a pace, or manner of going, in which
the beast is made to exert himself to the very utmost, and which is the most fatiguing to the ظَهْر
[meaning the camel that is ridden, or the beast
that carries one]: (S, Mgh, K:) or a journeying
in the beginning, or first part, of the night; (Lth,
S, K;) which is forbidden: (Lth, S, TA:) or, as
some say, the fatiguing a while, and abstaining a
while: (Lth, TA:) but Az says that Lth is not
correct in either of his explanations of this word:
(TA:) or an obstinate persisting in journeying:
or an obstinate persisting in journeying until the
camel that one is riding perishes or breaks down:
(K:) or, accord. to Az, the correct meaning, confirmed by what the Arabs said, is the making the
camel to go on, and urging him to that which fatigues him, and that which is beyond his power,
until he breaks down with his rider: or, accord.
to IAar, the jading of the weak [beast] by hard
journeying. (TA.) It is related in a trad., that
Mutarrif Ibn-Esh-Shikhkheer said to his son,
when he took extraordinary pains in religious
exercises, (S, TA,) and was immoderate therein,
(TA,) خَيْرُ الأُمُورِ أَوْسَاطُهَا وَ الحَسَنَةُ بَيْنَ الشَّيْئَيْنِ
وَ شَرُّ السَّيْرِ [The best of affairs, or actions,
or cases, are such of them as are between two extremes; and the good action is between the two
things; and the worst kind of journeying is that
in which the beast is made to exert himself to the
very utmost, &c.]: (S, TA:) meaning, pursue
thou the middle course in religious exercises, and
burden not thyself, lest thou become disgusted;
for the best of works is that which is continued,
though it be small. (TA.)
حَقٌّ contr. of بَاطِلٌ [used as a subst. and as an
epithet or act. part. n.]: (S, Msb, K:) or, as an
inf. n. [and used as a simple subst.], contr. of
بُطْلَانٌ; and as an act. part. n., and a simple
epithet, contr. of بَاطِلٌ. (Kull.) [As a subst.,]
its primary signification is Suitableness to the requirements of wisdom, justice, right, or rightness,
truth, reality, or fact; or to the exigencies of the
case; as the suitableness of the foot of a door in
respect of its socket, for turning round rightly:
(Er-Rághib, TA:) [and particularly] the suitableness of a judgment, and of what involves, or implies, a judgment, [i. e., of a saying, and a religion,
and a persuasion, or the like, (as will be shown by
one of the explanations of its meanings as an
epithet,)] to reality or fact; and the suitableness
of reality or fact to a judgment: (Kull:) [the
state, or quality, or property, of being just, proper, right, correct, or true; justness, propriety,
rightness, correctness, or truth; reality, or fact;
the state, &c., of being established, or confirmed,
as a truth or fact; of being necessary, requisite,
or unavoidable; of being binding, obligatory, incumbent, or due: (as shown above: see 1, first
sentence:)] and existence in relation to substances,
absolutely: and everlasting existence [in relation
to God]: (Kull:) pl. حُقُوقٌ and حِقَاقٌ: it has no
pl. of pauc. (TA.) As an act. part. n. and a
simple epithet, it is applied to a judgment [as
meaning] suitable to reality or fact; and to a
saying, and a religion, and a persuasion, considered
as involving, or implying, such a judgment:
(Kull:) to that which is suitable to the requirements of wisdom, justice, right, or rightness; as
when one says that every act of God is حَقّ: to a
belief, in a thing, suitable to the reality of the case;
as when one says that belief in the resurrection is
حَقّ: and to an action, and a saying, accordant
to what is requisite or obligatory, in quality and
measure and time; as when one says that the
action of another is حَقّ, and that his saying is حَقّ:
(Er-Rághib, TA:) [thus it signifies just, proper,
right, correct, or true; authentic, genuine, sound,
valid, substantial, or real; established, or confirmed, as a truth or fact: and necessary, requisite, or unavoidable: and binding, obligatory,
incumbent, or due:] also the necessarily-existing
by his own essence [applied to God; as an epithet
of Whom it has other meanings assigned to it by
some, as will be seen below]: and anything
existing, of an objective kind: (Kull:) existing
as an established fact, or truth, (K, TA,) so as to
be undeniable. (TA.) In the saying, هٰذَا عَبْدُ اللّٰهِ
الحَقَّ لَا البَاطِلَ [This is 'Abd-Allah, truly; not
falsely], the article ال is prefixed as it is in the
phrase, أَرْسَلَهَا العِرَاكَ; but sometimes it is dropped,
so that one says حَقًّا لَا بَاطِلًا. (Sb, TA.) And in
the phrase, لَحَقُّ لَا آتِيكَ, a form of oath, the nom.
case is used without tenween; but when the ل is
dropped, one says, حَقًّا لَا آتِيكَ: (S, TA:) [the
latter means Truly I will not come to thee: the
former seems to be best explained by what here
follows:] accord. to the A, لَحَقُّ لَا أَفْعَلُ is originally لَحَقُّ اللّٰهِ لَا أَفْعَلُ [The truth, or existence,
of God is that by which I swear, I will not do
such a thing]; the affixed noun [اللّٰه] being suppressed, and meant to be understood. (TA.)
الحَقُّ بِيَدِى [The right is mine] and الحَقُّ مَعِى
[The right is with me and الحَقُّ عَلَيْكَ The right is
against thee, which last is often used as meaning
thou art in fault, or in the wrong,] are said by
one disputing, or contending, for a thing. (TA.)
[And in like manner one says الحَقُّ بِيَدِكَ and
مَعَكَ as meaning Thou art in the right, and الحَقُّ
عَلَىَّ as meaning I am in the wrong.] One says
also, كَانَ ذٰلِكَ عِنْدَ حَقِّ لَقَاحِهَا, and لَقَاحِهَا ↓ حِقِّ
(tropical:)  That was on the occasion of the establishment of
the fact of her conception, or pregnancy. (S, A, K, *
TA.) And هٰذَا العَالِمُ حَقَّ العَالِمِ, [like هٰذَا العَالِمُ
جِدَّ العَالِمِ,] This is the learned man, the extremely
learned man. (Sb, TA.) And حَقُّ عَلِيمٍ means

the sense of the measure فَاعِلَةٌ, from حَقَّ الشَّىْءُ

A word, or phrase, so much used in a particular
tropical sense as to be, in that sense, conventionally regarded as proper; as, for instance, عَدْلٌ

participation with another person, but in a superior degree; as in the saying, الأَيِّمُ أَحَقُّ بِنَفْسِهَا
مِنْ وَلِيِّهَا, (Msb,) i. e. The woman that has not
a husband and is not a virgin [is more entitled
to dispose of herself than is her guardian];
(Mgh in art. ايم;) meaning that they participate
[in the right], but that her right is the stronger:
(Msb:) a saying of Mohammad, in which the
ايّم is opposed to the بِكْر, for it is added that the
بكر is to be asked her permission: but one reading
substitutes الثَّيِّبُ for الايّم. (Mgh ubi suprà.) In
the saying, in the Kur [v. 106], لَشَهَادَتُنَا أَحَقُّ
مِنْ شَهَادَتِهِمَا, it may be formed from اِسْتَحَقَّ by
rejection of the augmentative letters, so that the
meaning is, [Verily our testimony is] more deserving of being accepted [than the testimony of them
two]: or it may be from حَقَّ الشَّىْءُ signifying
ثَبَتَ, and so mean more true, or valid. (TA.)
-A2-  Applied to a horse, That does not sweat.
(S, K.) ―
-b2-  And, likewise thus applied, That
puts down his hind hoof in the place [that has
just before been that] of his fore hoof. (S, * K.)
[See حَقَقٌ.]
مُحِقٌّ Speaking truth; saying what is true;
(Msb;) contr. of مُبْطِلٌ: (K:) or revealing, or
manifesting, or showing, a truth, or a right or
due: or laying claim to a right [or to a thing
(see 4)] which is, or becomes, due to him. (Msb.)
مُحَقَّقٌ, [in the CK, erroneously, حُقَّق,] applied
to speech, or language, (tropical:)  Sound, or compact,
(S, K, TA,) and orderly. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And, applied
to a garment, or piece of cloth, (tropical:)  Firmly, or
compactly, woven, (S, K, TA,) and figured with
the form of حُقَق [pl. of حُقَّةٌ, q. v.]. (TA.)
[
مُحَقِّقٌ is often used as meaning A critical
judge in matters of literature.]
مَحْقُوقٌ: see حَقِيقٌ, in six places.
مِحَاقٌّ, applied to cattle, Such as have not
brought forth, nor been milked (لَمْ يُحْلَبْنَ [in
the CK, erroneously, لم يُجْلَبْنَ]), in the next
preceding year: (Ibn-'Abbád, K:) or whose first
and second milkings are of biestings. (AHát,
TA.)
طَعْنَةٌ مُحْتَقَّةٌ (in [some of] the copies of the
K, erroneously, مُحَقَّقَةٌ, TA) A thrust, or
piercing, in which is no swerving from the right
direction. (S, A, O, L, K.)
مُحَقْحِقٌ: see حَقْحَاقٌ.
