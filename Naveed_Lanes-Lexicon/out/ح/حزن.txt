حزن1
حَزِنَ, (S, Msb, K,) aor.

affected with حُزْن [q. v.; i. e. he grieved, mourned,
or lamented; or was sorrowful, sad, or unhappy;
&c.; عَلَيْهِ and لَهُ for him or it]. (S, Msb, K.)
لَا تَحْزَنْ and لَا تَحْزَنُوا, in the Kur [ix. 40, &c.,
and iii. 133], do not denote a prohibition of
getting حُزْن; for حُزْن does not come by the
will of man: the real meaning is Do not thou,
and ye, that which engenders حُزْن; do not thou,
and ye, acquire حُزْن. (Er-Rághib. [But this
requires consideration; or, rather, is not in every
case admissible.])

sorrowful or sad or unhappy; &c.]: (S, Msb,
K:) accord. to Yz, (S,) the former is of the dial.
of Kureysh; and the latter, of the dial. of
Temeem: (S, Msb:) and so say Th and Az:
(Msb, TA:) but the former is said to be the
more approved: (TA:) or, accord. to AZ, the
aor. of the former is used, but not the pret.;
(Msb, TA;) and when the act is ascribed to
God, the latter verb is used: Z, also, says that
what is well known in usage is the employing
the pret. of the latter and the aor. of the former:
(TA:) or احزنهُ signifies he made him حَزِين
[q. v.]; and حَزَنَهُ, [in some copies of the K
↓ حزّنهُ,] he made حُزْن to be in him: (Sb, K:)
or حَزَنَهُ, it caused him to fall into حُزْن. (TA.)

spirit, occasioned by grief: (Er-Rághib, TA:)

حزو and حزى
1
حَزْوٌ, (As, S,) aor. يَحْزُو, (S,) inf. n.
حَزْوٌ; (As, TA;) and حَزَى الشَّىْءَ, aor. يَحْزِى,
(S,) [inf. n. حَزْىٌ;] He computed, or determined,
the quantity, measure, or the like, of the thing;
(S;) he computed by conjecture the quantity, &c.
(As, S.) You say, حَزَيْتُ النَّخْلَ, (S, Msb,) inf. n.
حَزْىٌ; and حَزَوْتُهُ, inf. n. حَزْوٌ; I computed by
conjecture the quantity of the fruit upon the
palm-trees. (Msb.) In the copies of the K,
حَزَّى النَّخْلَ تَحْزِيَةً, meaning خَرَصَهُ, is erroneously put for حَزَى النَّخْلَ حَزْيًا, the words of As.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  حَزَا, (Lth, K,) aor. يَحْزُو, (Lth,) inf. n.

rise and fly, or drove them away, and divined
from their flight, or cries, &c.: (AZ, K, * TA:)
and drove them: (K, * TA: but the error in the
K, mentioned above, makes the verb in this case
also, and in the next following, to be حزّى, and
the inf. n. to be تَحْزِيَةٌ: TA:) [for] when a crow
croaks in front of a man, and he desires to obtain
some object of want, he says, “It is good,” and
goes forth: when it croaks behind his back, he
says, “This is evil,” and does not go forth: and
when a thing passes by him from the direction of
his right hand, he augurs good from it; but if
from the direction of his left hand, he augurs evil
from it. (AZ, TA.)

حَزَى السَّرابُ الآلٌ, or حَزَى الآلُ الشَّخْصَ: see آلٌ,
in art. اول]. (TA.)
