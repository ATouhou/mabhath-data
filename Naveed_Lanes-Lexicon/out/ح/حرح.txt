حرح1
حَرَحَهَا, aor.
حَرَحَ, He hit, or hurt, her (a woman's) حِرْح or حِر [i. e. vulva, or pudendum]. (K.)
حِرٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) similar in form to يَدٌ and
دَمٌ, (Msb,) and حِرٌّ (AHeyth, Az, Msb) and حِرَةٌ;
(K;) the first of which is the most common; and
the last, strange; (TA;) or the first is sometimes
used instead of the second; (Msb;) The vulva,
or pudendum, of a woman: originally ↓ حِرْحٌ, (S,
Mgh, Msb, K,) as is shown by the form of its
broken pl., (S, Mgh, Msb,) and by that of its
dim.; for in the formation of the broken pl. and
of the dim., a word is restored to its original state:
the final ح in the original is elided, and ر is put
in its stead, and incorporated into the medial
radical letter; and sometimes the word is used
without any letter of compensation: thus are
formed حِرٌّ and حِرٌ: (Msb:) the pl. is أَحْرَاحٌ,
(S, Mgh, Msb, K,) its only broken pl., (TA,)
and حِرُونَ, (S, K,) which latter is like لِدُونَ and
مِئُونَ, pls. of defective nouns [لِدَةٌ and مِئَةٌ]: (S:)
dim. ↓ حُرَيْحٌ. (Msb.)
حِرْحٌ: see the paragraph next preceding.
حَرِحٌ A man loving, (L, TA,) or fond of, (K,)
the أَحْرَاح [or pudenda] of women: (L, K:) an
epithet after the manner of a rel. n. (Sb, TA.) ―
-b2-
See also حِرِىٌّ.
حِرَحِىٌّ: see what next follows.
حِرِىٌّ, and (if you will, S) ↓ حِرَحِىٌّ, (S, K,) in
which latter the medial radical letter is with fet-h,
as in the rel. ns. formed from يَدُ and غَدٌ, namely,
يَدَوِىٌّ and غَدَوِىٌّ; (S;) [Of, or belonging to, or
relating to, the vulva, or pudendum, of a woman;]
rel. ns. of حِرٌ [and حِرْحٌ]: and (if you will, S)
you may say ↓ حَرِحٌ, like سَتِةٌ. (S, K.)
حُرَيحٌ: see حِرٌ, above.
مَحْرُوحَةٌ A woman hit, or hurt, in her حِرْح or
حِر [i. e. vulva, or pudendum]. (K.)
