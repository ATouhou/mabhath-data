like خَضَبَ العَرْفَجُ: and one says, of the رِمْث,
when it first breaks out for its leaves to come
forth, قَدْ أَقْمَلَ; and when it has increased little

chaste; (S in art. بر;) the well-known grain
called بُرٌّ: (TA:) chewed, and applied as a poultice, it is good for the bite of a dog: (K:) or,
correctly, what is chewed thereof disperses humours; but for the bite of a dog, it is coarsely
pounded, and put upon the bite; as is said by the
author of the “ Minháj: ” and one of its wellknown properties is this; that when it is put upon
a piece of heated iron, and powdered, and ringworms (قَوَابِىّ) are smeared with the moisture
thereof, it removes them: (TA:) pl. حِنَطٌ.

or sandal-wood, bruised: derived from حَنَطَ said
of the رِمْث, signifying that its colour became
white inclining to yellowness, and its odour
sweet: (IAth:) the term حنوط is applied to
