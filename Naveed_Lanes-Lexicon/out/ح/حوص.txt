حوص1
حَاصَهُ, (A, TA,) aor. يَحُوصُ, (A, K,) inf. n.
حَوْصٌ (S, A, Mgh, K) and حِيَاصَةٌ, (A, TA,) He
sewed it, or sewed it up or together; (S, * A,
Mgh, * K, TA;) namely, a garment, or piece of
cloth: (A, TA:) or he sewed it with stitches far
apart: (IB, TA:) or he sewed it without a
patch; and only said of a skin, or of skin, and
of a camel's foot. (TA.) Hence the prov., إِنَّ
دَوَآءَ الشَّقِّ أَنْ تَحُوصَهُ [Verily the remedy for the
rent is that thou sew it up]. (A, K.) [And
hence the saying,] لَأَطْعَنَنَّ فِى حَوْصِهِمْ (S, A)
(tropical:)  I will assuredly mar what they have repaired:
(A:) or I will assuredly make a hole in what they
have sewed up, and I will assuredly mar what
they have repaired. (S, IB.) Or لَأَطْعَنَنَّ فِى حَوْصِكَ
(tropical:)  I will assuredly circumvent thee, (لَأَكِيدَنَّكَ [so
in copies of the K, and in the TA, but in the
CK, erroneously, لَاكْبِدَنَّكَ,]) and I will assuredly
labour for thy destruction. (AZ, K.) And it is
said in a prov., طَعَنَ فِى حَوْصِ أَمْرٍ لَيْسَ مِنْهُ فِى
شَىْءٍ, (K,) and أَمْرٍ ↓ حُوصِ, and أَمْرٍ ↓ حُوصَى, (Yoo,
K,) (tropical:)  He laboured at that which he could not do
well, and tasked himself to do that with which he
had no concern. (ISh, K.) Or طَعَنْتَ فِى حَوْصِ
أَمْرٍ لَسْتَ مِنْهُ فِى شَىْءٍ (tropical:)  Thou hast spoken of a
thing with which thou hast no concern. (A.)
You say also, قَبْلَ أَنْ أَدْخُلَ حَوْصِ النَّاسِ أَطْمَعُ
فِى ضَرْبِهِمْ (tropical:)  Before I penetrate into the case of
the people, and test them, I am ambitious of
smiting them. (A.) And مَا طَعَنْتَ فِى حَوْصِهِ
(tropical:)  Thou hast not attained the object of thy desire
[with respect to him or it: or perhaps the right
reading is حَوْصِكَ, in which case the addition
which I have made should be omitted]. (IB, as
quoted in the L and TA.) ―
