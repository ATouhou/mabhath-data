حرقصحُرْقُوصٌ A certain insect, resembling the flea,
(S, A, K,) to which, sometimes, there grow two
wings, and then it flies; (S;) or, as some say,
larger than the flea; (TA;) or like the tick;
(A;) accord. to Lth, a certain variegated insect
(دُوَيْبَّةٌ مُجَزَّعَةٌ); (TA;) the حُمَة [i. e. venom, or
sting,] of which is like that of the hornet; (A,
K;) which sticks to men, and bites, or stings;
(تَلْدَغُ;) and to which the extremities of whips
are likened; (A;) or, accord. to Az, it has no
حُمَة when it bites; but its bite occasions much
pain, [though] it has no venom (سُمّ) like that of
hornets: (TA:) or (K) a certain small insect,
(IDrd, TA,) resembling the tick, that sticks to
men: (IDrd, K, TA:) or it is smaller than the
[black beetle called] جُعَل; (ISk, TA;) or, accord.
to the M, a thing like a small pebble, speckled a
little with red or yellow, but its prevailing colour
is black; which collects, and enters beneath men,
and in their groins, or armpits, or the like, and
bites them; and rends the skins in which water
or milk is kept; or, as in the T, a certain small
insect, (TA,) which makes holes in the skins
wherein water or milk is kept, and (as Az heard
the Arabs of the desert to assert, TA) enters into
the pudenda of girls; (K, TA;) and is of the
same kind as جِعْلَان [pl. of جُعَلٌ], but smaller;
black, speckled with white: (TA:) because of
its entering into the فَرْج of the virgin girl, it is
called عَاشِقُ الأَبْكَارِ: (IB, TA:) pl. حَرَاقِيصُ.
