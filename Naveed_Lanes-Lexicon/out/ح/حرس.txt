حرس1
حَرَسَهُ, (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.
حَرُسَ (S, Msb,
TA) and
حَرِسَ (TA,) inf. n. حِرَاسَةٌ (S, Mgh, K)
and حَرْسٌ, (K,) or ↓ the former is a simple subst.,
(Msb,) and the latter is an inf. n. only on the
authority of analogy, though often used by [the
Hanafee Imám] Mohammad, (Mgh,) He guarded,
kept, preserved, or took care of, him or it: (S,
Mgh, Msb:) [and so ↓ حارسهُ; or he guarded him,
being guarded by him: see 3 in art. ربأ.] You say,
حَرَسَهُ اللّٰهُ مِنَ البَلَآءِ [May God guard him from
trial, or affliction]: and أَدَامَ حِرَاسَتَهُ [May He continue the guarding of him]. (A.) ―
-b2-  حَرَسَ, aor.
حَرِسَ,
(Msb, K,) inf. n. حَرْسٌ, (Msb,) (tropical:)  He stole;
(Msb, K;) [ironically used in this sense; see
حَارِسٌ;] as also ↓ احترس: (K:) or the latter, he
stole a sheep or goat by night: (S:) or both, he
stole camels and sheep or goats by night, and ate
them: (TA:) or the latter, he stole [a sheep or
the like] from the mountain: (El-Fárábee, Msb:)
or he took, (Sh, TA,) or stole, (TA,) a thing
from the place of pasturage. (Sh, TA.) You
say also, حَرَسَنِى شَاةً, (A, Mgh,) and ↓ أَحْرَسَنِى,
(A, TA,) [but the latter is perhaps a mistranscription for ↓ اِحْتَرَسَنِى,] (tropical:)  He stole from me a sheep
or goat. (Mgh.)

حَاْرَسَ see 5:
-A2-  and see حَرَسَ, in two places.
حَرَسٌ: see حَارِسٌ: for the former, in two places.
حَرَسِىٌّ: see حَارِسٌ: for the former, in two places.
حِرَاسَةٌ: see 1.
-A2-  فُلَانٌ يَأْكُلُ الحِرَاسَاتِ Such a
one eats stolen things: (A:) or steals the sheep
or goats of people, one after another, and eats of
them. (TA.)
حَرِيسَةٌ What is guarded, kept, preserved, or
taken care of. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  (tropical:)  A thing stolen: (K:)
or a sheep, or goat, that is stolen by night: (S:)
of the measure فَعِيلَةٌ in the sense of the measure
مَفْعُولَةٌ: (TA:) hence, حَرِيسَةُ الجَبَلِ (S) a sheep,
or goat, that is overtaken by the night before its
return to its nightly resting-place, and is stolen
from the mountain: (Msb:) or a sheep, or
goat, that is stolen, of those that are guarded,
or kept, in the mountain: or, as some say, from
حَارِسٌ applied ironically to a thief: (Mgh:) pl.
حَرَائِسُ (S, K.) Hence the saying, (TA,) لَا قَطْعَ
فِى حَرِيسَةِ الجَبَلِ (tropical:)  [There shall be no amputation
of the hand for the sheep, or goat, that is stolen
by night from the mountain]. (A, TA.) IF says
that there are two explanations of the expression
حريسة الجبل: some make it to signify theft, or
the thing stolen, (السَّرِقَةُ,) itself: others make the
meaning to be, that there shall be no amputation
for [stealing] what is guarded, or kept, in the
mountain, because it is not a place well protected: ISk says that الحَرِيسَةُ signifies السَّرِقَةُ.
(Msb.) ―
-b3-  A wall of stones, made for sheep, or
goats, (K,) to guard them. (TA.)
حَارِسٌ Guarding, keeping, or preserving; a
guardian, or keeper: (S, Mgh, Msb:) pl. ↓ حَرَسٌ
(Mgh, Msb, K) [or this is rather a quasi-pl. n.]
and حُرَّاسٌ (Msb, K) and [pl. of pauc.] أَحْرَاسٌ.
(K.) ↓ حَرَسٌ also signifies The guards of a
Sultán; (S, * Msb, K TA;) and so حُرَّاسٌ: (S,
K:) the former is thus used as a gen. n.: (S,
Msb:) and the n. un. is ↓ حَرَسِىٌّ: (S, Msb, K:)
you do not say حَارِسٌ unless you mean to denote
thereby the signification of guarding, or keeping,
without the quality of a gen. n. (S, Msb.) ―
-b2-
Also (tropical:)  A thief; used in this sense ironically; (A,
Mgh, TA;) because they found guardians to be
thieves; (A, TA;) and so ↓ مُحْتَرِسٌ: (TA:)
pl. of the former, حُرَّاسٌ. (A.)
مُحْتَرَسٌ [pass. part. n. of 8]. You say, مُحْتَرَسٌ
مِنْ مِثْلِهِ وَهْوَ حَارِسٌ [From such as he does one
guard himself, whereas he is a guardian]: a
prov.: (S, K:) alluding to him who finds fault
with a bad man when he is himself worse than
he: (K:) or to him who is intrusted with the
guarding of a thing when one is not secure
from his being unfaithful with respect to it.
(TA.) [See also Freytag's Arab. Prov., ii. 706.]
مُحْتَرِسٌ: see حَارِسٌ, last signification.
