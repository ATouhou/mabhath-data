حنث1
حَنِثَ فِى يَمِينِهِ, (S, A, Msb, K, *) aor.
حَنَثَ,
(Msb, K,) inf. n. حِنْثٌ (S, * A, Msb, K *) and
حَنَثٌ, (TA,) He violated, or broke, or failed of
performing, his oath: (A, Msb, K, TA:) he was
untrue in his oath: (S, TA:) he committed a
sin, or crime, in his oath. (TA.) Also He retracted, or revoked, his oath. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And the
verb alone, He said what was not true. (Khálid
Ibn-Jembeh, TA.) ―
-b3-  He inclined from what was
false to what was true: or from what was true
to what was false. (K.) ―
-b4-  [And app. (assumed tropical:)  He
committed a sin, or crime: a meaning which
seems to be indicated in the K: see حِنْثٌ, below.]
2
حنْثهُ He pronounced him (جَعَلَهُ) a violator,
or non-performer, of his oath: (Msb:) [a verb
similar to أَثَّمَهُ and فَسَّقَهُ &c.]
4
أَحْنَثْتُهُ (S, K) فِى يَمِينِهِ (S) I made him to
violate, or break, or fail of performing, his oath.
(S, K. *) ―
-b2-  احنث فُلَانٌ قَسَمَ فُلَانٍ Such a one
assented not, or consented not, to the conjurement
of such a one; contr. of أَبَرَّ. (T and TA in
art. بر.)
5
تحنّث (assumed tropical:)  He put away, or cast away, from
himself الحِنْث, i. e. sin, or crime: (ISd, Towsheeh, TA:) it is said that there are only six
verbs of the measure of this signifying the putting
away, or casting away, from oneself a thing, [i. e.
the thing denoted by the root,] which are تحنّث
and تأثّم and تحوّب and تحرّج and تنجّس and
تهجّد: (TA:) (assumed tropical:)  he did a work whereby to escape
from sin, or crime: (IAar, Msb:) (assumed tropical:)  he applied
himself to acts, or exercises, of devotion; (S, A,
Msb, K;) accord. to Ez-Zuhree and the K,
during numerous nights; but it has been shown
by the Expositors of El-Bukháree, and others,
that this addition is taken from words following
the verb in the explanation of a trad., and has
nothing to do with the meaning of the verb itself:
(MF, TA:) (assumed tropical:)  he relinquished [the worship of]
idols; (S, K;) like تحنّف; (S;) and it may be
that the ث in this verb is interchangeable with
ف, (A,) or a substitute for ف. (TA.) You say
also, تحنّث مِنْ كَذَا (tropical:)  He abstained from such
a thing as a sin, or crime; syn. تأثّم, (S, A, K,)
and تحرّج. (A.) And تحنّث بِأَفْعَالٍ (assumed tropical:)  He sought
to bring himself near unto God, or to advance
himself in God's favour, by works [of devotion
&c.]. (TA.)
حِنْثٌ The violation, or failure of performance,
of an oath: (S, A, K, TA:) [an inf. n. used as
a simple subst.:] pl. أَحْنَاثٌ; as in the saying,
عَلَيْهِ أَحْنَاثٌ كَثِيرَةٌ [He is accountable for, or
chargeable with, many violations, or failures of
performance, of oaths]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  (tropical:)  A sin, a
crime, an offence, or an act of disobedience. (S,
A, Msb, K.) So in the saying [in the Kur
lvi. 45], وَكَانُوا يُصِرُّونَ عَلَى الحِنْثِ العَظِيمِ
(tropical:)  [And they persisted in great sin]; (A;) meaning belief in a plurality of gods. (Bd, Jel.) And
hence, (Bd in lvi. 45,) بَلَغَ الحِنْثَ (tropical:)  He (a boy)
attained to the age when he was punishable for
sin: (A, * Bd:) or attained to [the age when he
became punishable for] disobedience and [rewardable for] obedience: (S:) or attained to the age
when the pen [of the recording angels] began to
register his acts of obedience and of disobedience:
attained to the age of puberty: attained to manhood. (TA.) [Hence also,] أَوْلَادُ الحِنْثِ (assumed tropical:)  The
children of adultery or fornication: occurring
in a trad., accord. to one reading: accord. to
another reading, اولاد الخُبْثِ. (L.)
حَانِثٌ Violating, or failing to perform, his
oath; or a violator, or non-performer, of his
oath. (Msb.)
مَحْنَثٌ: see مَحَانِثُ.
مُحْنِثٌ A thing respecting which people differ,
and which admits of its being regarded in two
different ways; as also مُحْلِفٌ. (L.) [So called
because it may make one to be untrue in an
oath.]
مَحَانِثُ, accord. to some, having no sing.;
but accord. to others, its sing. is ↓ مَحْنَثٌ, and
this is app. the truth, and is agreeable with analogy;
(MF;) Places [i. e. occasions] of falling into the
violation of an oath or oaths, or (assumed tropical:)  into sin or
crime; expl. by مَوَاقِعُ حِنْثٍ (TA) and مَوَاقِعُ
إِثْمٍ. (K.)
