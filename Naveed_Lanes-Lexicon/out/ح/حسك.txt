أَحْسَكَتِ النَّفَلَةُ The plant of the species termed
نَفَل [q. v.] put forth a حَسَكَة, i. e. a prickle.
(TA.)
حَسَكٌ [is applied, app. in the classical language,
as it is in the present day, to Various species of
thistle, and other prickly plants: also to the
heads of thistles and the like: and particularly to
the caltrop, or tribulus: and hence the explanations here following:] the حَسَك [or prickly
heads] of the [plant called] سَعْدَان: (S:) or a
certain herb, (Aboo-Ziyád, Mgh, TA,) inclining
to yellowness, (Aboo-Ziyád, TA,) having [a head
of] prickles of rounded form: (Aboo-Ziyád, Mgh,
TA:) seldom, or never, does any one walk
upon it, when it has dried up, without putting
upon his feet boots or sandals: and the ants transport its produce [or heads] to their nests: (Aboo-Ziyád, TA:) a certain plant, the produce [or
head] whereof (which is rough [or prickly], TA)
clings to the wool of sheep, (K,) and to the fur
of camels, in their places of pasturing: (TA:)
its leaves are like those of purslane (الرِّجْلَة), or
narrower, and at its leaves are compact and hard
prickles, having three forks: [hence it seems to
be a species of three-horned caltrop: or for
“ three,” we should perhaps read four: (see
another application of the word in what follows:)]
the drinking [of an infusion] thereof has the
effect of crumbling the stone of the kidneys and
bladder; and the drinking of the expressed juice
of its leaves is good for the venereal faculty, and
for difficulty in the discharge of urine, and for
the bite of vipers; and the sprinkling it in the
dwelling kills fleas: (K:) also, accord. to Aboo-Nasr, the produce of the [plant called] نَفَل:
(TA:) and sharp. hard prickles or thorns: (TA
in art. مسك:) n. un. with ة: (S, Mgh:) which
some hold to apply to any fruit, or produce, of a
plant, that is of the kind termed عُقْدَةٌ [i. e.
forming a compact and roundish head]; and
hence, to the pod of the cotton-plant: and it also
signifies a prickle, or thorn. (TA.) [Hence,]
