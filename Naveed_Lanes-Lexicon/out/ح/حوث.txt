حوثحَوْثُ a dial. var. of حَيْثُ, (S, K,) of the dial.
of Teiyi, (Lh, IHsh, K,) or of that of Temeem:
(L:) some of the Arabs say حَوْثَ, like as some
say حَيْثَ; (Ks, Lh, TA;) and some say حَوْثِ:
(Mughnee and TA in art. حيث:) حَوْثُ is the
original form; (ISd, TA;) but حَيْثُ is the more
chaste of the two forms, and that used in the
Kur-án; though both forms are good. (AZ, TA.)

(TA.)

حَاجَةٌ (S, K, &c.) and ↓ حَائِجَةٌ, (AA, IDrd,
&c.,) of which latter the former is a contraction,
(Kh in the 'Eyn, TA,) or the latter word is
unused [except as an epithet, as will be seen
below], and ↓ حَوْجَآءُ, (S, K, &c.,) are syn. words,
of which the meaning is well known: (S, K,
TA:) Want; need; necessity, or necessitude;
exigency: (TA:) [whence,] اِبْنُ حَاجَةً one who
is constantly in want, or need: (Har p. 143:)
حَاجَةٌ is a more general term than فَقْرٌ; or each
of these terms is more general than the other in
some respects, and more particular in others:
(TA:) and the former signifies also a thing
wanted, needed, or required; an object of want,
of need, or of exigence; a want; a needful, or
requisite, thing, affair, or business: (A, TA:)
[and a thing to be done, an affair, or a business:]
pl. ↓ حَاجٌ, [or rather this is a coll. gen. n., of
which حَاجَةٌ is the n. un.,] and حَاجَاتٌ, [which
is of more frequent occurrence,] (S, Msb, K,)
and حِوَجٌ, [which is of rare occurrence,] (S, K,)
and حَوَائِجُ, (S, Msb, K,) which is anomalous,
(S, K,) and was disapproved by As, and pronounced by him to be post-classical, but he disapproved it only because of its being anomalous,
(S,) and he is said to have retracted his assertion
of its being post-classical, (TA,) for it is of frequent occurrence in the [classical] language of the
Arabs, (S,) in their verses and in the traditions:
(IB, TA:) it seems as though formed from the
sing. حَائِجَةٌ, (S, K,) which some assert to have
been not used; or, accord. to some, it may be pl.
of حَوْجَآءُ, changed from the regular form of حَوَاجٍ,
[originally حَوَاجِىُ,] like صَحَارٍ, by putting the
[elided] ى before the ج, agreeably with what
is often done in the language of the Arabs. (TA.)
You say, قَضَى حَاجَتَهُ [He accomplished his
want]: (TA:) a phrase which signifies [also]
he did his business; meaning he eased nature.
(ISk, TA.) And خُذْ حَاجَتَكَ مِنَ الطَّعَامِ [Take
what thou wantest, or requirest, of the food].
(A.) And فِى نَفْسِى حَاجَةٌ and ↓ حَائِجَةٌ and
↓ حَوْجَآءُ [In my mind is a want]. (AA, TA.)
And لِى عِنْدَ فُلَانٍ حَاجَةٌ [I want a thing of such
a one]. (TA.) [When the thing wanted, or not
wanted, is mentioned, or referred to by a pronoun, the subst. denoting it, or the pronoun
referring to it, is preceded by إِلَى, as in the sayings لِى حَاجَةٌ إِلَى كَذَا I have a want of such a
thing, and مَا لِى إِلَيْهِ حَاجَةٌ I have not any want
of it, and مَا حَاجَتُكَ إِلَيْهِ What is the reason of
thy want of it, or thy wanting it?] You say
also, وَلَا لَوْجَآءُ إِلَّا قَضَاهَا ↓ مَا بَقِىَ فِى حَوْجَآءُ
There remained not in his bosom a want but he
accomplished it. (TA.) [The dim. of حَوْجَآءُ is
↓ حُوَيْجَآءُ: whence the saying,] ↓ مَا لِى فِيهِ حَوْجَآءُ
وَلَا لُوَيْجَآءُ ↓ وَلَا لَوْجَآءُ وَلَا حُوَيْجَآءُ I have no want,
[nor any little want,] with respect to him, or it.
(Lh, S, K.) [See also حَوْجَآءُ, below.] In the
phrase حُجْ حُجَيَّاكَ [Seek the little thing that
thou wantest], it seems that the second and third
radical letters of the latter word [originally
حُوَيْجَآءَكَ] have been transposed [and that
حُجَيْوَآءَكَ has been then changed into حُجَيَّاكَ].
(IDrd, AAF, TA.) ―
-b2-  مَا تَرَكْتُ مِنْ حَاجَةٍ وَلَا
دَاجَةٍ I left not any act of disobedience to which
I was enticed. (TA from a trad. [But see دَاجَةٌ
in art. دوج.])
حَوْجَآءُ: see حَاجَةٌ, in four places: ―
-b2-  and see
(??) ―
-b3-  You say also, (??)
(??) (??) There is not in my bosom any doubt re-
(??) him, or it. (Th, S, K.) And لَيْسَ فِى
(??) (??) ↓ أَمْرِكَ حُوَيْجَآءُ [There is not
(??) of thine affair, or
(??)
وَلَا لَوْجَآءَ, like the phrase (??)
بَيْضَآءُ, i. e. I spoke to him, and he return (??)
not a bad word nor a good one. (ISk, S, K.)
حُوَيْجَآءُ: see حَاجَةٌ, in two places: ―
-b2-  and see
حَوْجَآءُ. ―
-b3-  You say also, خُذْ حُوَيْجَآءَ مِنَ الأَرْضِ
Take thou a different and winding road of the
land. (K.)
حَائِجَةٌ: see حَاجَةٌ, in two places. ―
-b2-  You say
also حَاجَةٌ حَائِجَةٌ and ↓ حَاجَةٌ حَوْجَآءُ A great
want; a thing much wanted. (TA.)
مُحْوِجٌ A man in want, needy, indigent, or
poor; (Msb, TA;) [as also ↓ مُحْتَاجٌ:] the pl.,
by rule, should be مُحْوِجُونَ because it is an
epithet applied to a rational being; but the pl.
used is مَجَاوِيجُ: some, however, reject this, and
assert that it has not been heard [as a classical
word]: (Msb:) ISd thinks that محاويج is pl. of
↓ مِحْوَاجٌ, if the latter word have been used:
(TA:) the vulgar say مَحَاوِجُ [as pl. of مُحْوِجٌ],
meaning مُحْتَاجُونَ. (Mgh.)
مِحْوَاجٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
مُحْتَاجٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
