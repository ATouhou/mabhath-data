حلى1
حَلَيْتُ المَرْأَةَ, aor.
حَلِىَ, inf. n. حَلْىٌ, I assigned,
or gave, to the woman حُلِىّ [or ornaments];
and so حَلَوْتُهَا. (S.) [See also 2.]
-A2-  حَلِيَتْ, (S,
Msb, K,) aor.
حَلِىَ, (K,) inf. n. as above, (Msb, K,)
She (a woman) acquired an ornament, or orna
ments: (K:) or she wore on ornament, or orna
ments; as also ↓ تحلّت: (Msb, K:) or the
former signifies she had an ornament, or orna
ments: (S, K:) and ↓ the latter, she adorned
herself with an ornament, or ornaments: (S,
Mgh, * TA:) or she made for herself an orna
ment, or ornaments. (Msb, TA.) ―
-b2-  لَمْ يَحْلَ
مِنْهُ بِطَائِلٍ He gained not, or derived not, from
him, or it, any great profit, advantage, or benefit:
the verb is not used in this sense except in nega
tive phrases; (S, TA;) and is from الحَلْىُ and
الحِلْيَةُ; because the mind reckons an ornament
as an acquisition: not from حلو. (TA.) [But
an affirmative phrase, with the verb حَلِىَ used in
a similar sense, is mentioned in the K in
art. حلو: see 1 in that art. See also 1 in art.
حلأ.] ―
-b3-  See also حَلِى, below.
-A3-  حَلِيَتِ الشَّفَةُ:
see حَلِئَت, in art. حلأ.

حلّى المَرْأَةَ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَحْلِيَةٌ, (K,)
He decked the woman with an ornament, or
ornaments: (S, Msb, K: [see also 1, first sen
tence: and in like manner, السَّيْفَ the sword:])
or he made for her an ornament, or ornaments:
or he described her: (K:) or you say also حَلَّيْتُ
الرَّجُلَ as meaning I described the حِلْيَة [i. e.
quality, or qualities or attributes, or state or con
dition,] of the man: (S:) and you say also, حلّاهُ
عَلَيْهِ [he described it to him]. (L in art. سملج.)
The verb in the first of these senses is doubly
trans., as in the saying in the Kur [xviii. 30, &c.],
يُحَلّوْنَ فِيهَا مِنْ أَسَاوِرَ مِنْ ذَهَبٍ [They shall be
decked therein with bracelets of gold]. (TA.)

woman, (S, Mgh, Msb,) of moulded metal, or of
stones, (K,) or of gold, or of silver, and some
say, or of jewels, or gems: (Mgh:) pl. حُلِىٌّ (S,
Mgh, Msb, K) and حِلِىٌّ, also, because of the حُلِىٌّ
like عِصِىٌّ: (S, TA:) or حَلْىٌ is a pl. [or coll.
gen. n.], and its sing. [or n. un.] is ↓ حَلْيَةٌ: (K:)
so says AAF: (TA:) ↓ حِلْيَةٌ, also, signifies the
same as حَلْىٌ; (K; [in the CK حُلِىّ;]) and
particularly, (K,) the ornament, or ornaments,
حَلْىٌ, K, or زِينَةٌ, Mgh and Msb,) of gold or
silver, (Mgh,) of a sword, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) as
also ↓ حَلَاةٌ, (K,) or of a lamp, and of other
things: (Mgh:) accord. to Lth, حَلْىٌ signifies
any حِلْيَة [i. e. ornament, or ornaments,] with
which one decks a woman or a sword and the
like: but accord. to others, only of a woman;
and one says only ↓ حِلْيَةٌ in relation to other
things, to a sword [for instance], and the like:
(TA:) the pl. of حِلْيَةٌ is حِلًى and حُلًى; (S, K;)
or, accord. to IF, it has no pl. (Msb.)
حَلِى A cry by which a she-camel is chidden;
as also حَلِ and حَلْ; like as a he-camel is by the
cry حَوْبِ and حَوْبُ &c.: (TA voce حَوْبِ:) or
by which female camels are chidden; as also
حَلْ, and, when in connexion with a following
word, حَلٍ. (TA voce حَلْ, in art. حل.) One
says, in chiding the she-camel, ↓ حَلِى لَا حَلِيتِ
[On! mayest thou not gain any great benefit:
like as one says, in chiding the he-camel, حَبْ
لَا مَشِيتَ, &c.]. (TA in the present art.)

and سَبَط: Az says, it is one of the best kinds of
pasture of the people of the desert for camels and
horses; and when its produce appears, it resembles
eared corn: accord. to Lth, it is every plant that
resembles corn, or seed-produce, in its manner of
growth; but this, says Az, is a mistake: (TA:)
n. un. with ة: (K:) and pl. أَحْلِيَةٌ. (S.)
