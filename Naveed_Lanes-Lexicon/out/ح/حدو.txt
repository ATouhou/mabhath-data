حَدَا الإِبِلَ, (S, Mgh,) or حَدَ بِالإِبِلِ, (Msb,)
or both, (K) and حُدَآءٌ (S, K) and حِدَآءٌ, (K,) He
drove the camels; (S, Mgh, K;) and chid them:
(K:) [and ↓ احتداها app. has the former signification:] and he sang to them: (S:) or he urged,
or excited, the camels by singing to them, which
is termed ↓ حُدَآءٌ: (Msb:) or حَدَا لَهَا signifies he
sang to them. (Mgh.) The Arabs in driving
their camels used commonly to sing verses of the
kind termed رَجَز. (TA in art. رجز.) [It is said
that] ↓ حُدَآءٌ originated from the fact of a DesertArab's beating his young man, or boy, and biting
his fingers; whereupon he went along saying
دَىْ دَىْ, meaning يَا يَدَىَّ [“ O my two hands! ”];
and the camels went on at his cry; therefore his
master bade him keep to it: (K in art. دى:)
so says IAar. (TA in that art. [Other (similar)
accounts of its origin are mentioned by MF in
remarking on this passage of the K.]) حَدَا signifies also He raised his voice with [the singing
termed] الحُدَآء. (Har p. 576.) [And He breathed
short (anhelavit), and sent forth a voice or sound.

so the [wild] he-ass his she-asses; and anything
any other thing. (TA.) Hence the saying, لَا
أَفْعَلُهُ مَا حَدَا اللَّيْلُ النَّهَارَ (assumed tropical:)  I will not do it as long
as the night follows the day]. (TA.) ―

تحدّاهُ, in its primary sense, is form الحُدَآءُ,
and signifies He (a driver of camels) vied, competed, or contended for superiority, with him,
or emulated him, (namely, another driver,) in
driving camels, or urging them by singing to
them; each of them desiring to elicit the ability
of the other in doing so. (Z, TA.) ―
-b2-  [And hence,]
He vied, or competed, and contended for superiority, with him, (S, K, * mentioned in the K

sought to elicit the ability of the people in order
that it might be known which of us was most
skilled in reading or reciting [the Kur-án]: it
means like as does the saying of a person contending with others for the superior glory of his
people, “Bring ye a people like my people, or
like one of them. ” (Msb.) It is said of Mohammad, in a trad., تَحَدَّى العَرَبَ بِالقُرْآنِ [He vied,
or contended, with the Arabs by means of the
Kur-án]. (TA.) And one says, تَحَدَّى صَاحِبَهُ القِرَآءَةَ,
and الصِّرَاعَ, [He vied, or contended, with his companion in reading, or reciting, and in wrestling,]
in order that it might be seen which of them was
the superior reader or reciter, and the superior
wrestler. (TA.) ―

↓ احداهُ. (Sgh, and K ib.) Hence the saying of
Mujáhid, كُنْتُ أَتَحَدَّى القُرْآنَ فَأَقْرَأُ [I used to
aim at reading, or reciting, the Kur-án, and so to
read, or recite]. (AA, TA.)
