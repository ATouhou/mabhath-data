possessor of fortunateness, &c., among them and
in their estimation; i. e., among those women

adds that one does not say this except in relation
to a state subsisting between men and women:
(TA:) and the mullà 'Alee, in his “ Námoos,”
[an Expos. of the Kámoos,] says that حظوة seems
to apply peculiarly to the case of a woman, as it
does in the common conventional language: but
it is of common application, agreeably with the
explanations in the K, as is expressly asserted
on the authority of Th and others. (MF.)

(S, Msb, K,) applied to a woman in favour with,
or beloved by, and in high estimation with, her

For حَظِيَّةٌ, the vulgar say, erroneously, ↓ مَحْظِيَّة;
[meaning thereby A concubine; in which sense
حَظِيَّةٌ is used by late writers;] and making the
pl. مَحَاظِى, which is also wrong. (TA.) Hence
