حير1
حَارَ, [sec. pers. حِرْتَ,] aor. يَحَارُ, (S, A, Mgh,
Msb, K,) and some say يَحِيرُ, but this is a mistake, (MF,) inf. n. حَيْرَةٌ (S, A, Mgh, K) and حَيَرٌ
(S, Msb, K) and حَيْرٌ and حَيَرَانٌ, (K,) He was,
or became, dazzled by a thing at which he looked,
(T, Msb, K,) so that he turned away his eyes
from it: this is the primary signification: (T,
Msb:) and so ↓ تحيّر (A, * Mgh, * K) and ↓ استحار,
(K,) and حاربَصَرُهُ (A, * TA) and بصره ↓ تحيّر.
(Mgh, and S and A and K in art. قمر, &c.) ―
-b2-
And hence, (T, Msb,) He was, or became, confounded, or perplexed, and unable to see his
right course; (T, Msb, K, * TA;) as also ↓ تحيّر
(Msb, K) and ↓ استحار. (K.) And حار, (S, A,)
or حار فِى أَمْرِهِ, (Msb,) i. q. فى امره ↓ تحيّر [He
was, or became, confounded, &c., in his affair,
or case]. (S, A.) And [حار (see its part. n.
حَائِرٌ) and] ↓ تحيّر [and ↓ استحار] He erred, or
lost his way. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Also, said of water, (A,
Msb, K,) and ↓ تحيّر (S, A, K) and ↓ استحار,
(A, K,) (tropical:)  It became collected, (S, A, K,) and
stayed, (A,) or went round, (S, K, *) or went to
and fro, or fluctuated, (Msb, K,) in a place, as
though it knew not which way to run. (A.) ―

حيّرهُ He, or it, caused him to become confounded, or perplexed, and unable to see his
right course. (S, * Msb, KL.) ―
-b2-  [Accord. to
Golius, as on the authority of the KL, حيّر, said
of water, means (assumed tropical:)  It was whirled round in an
eddy: but to have this meaning, which I do not
find in my copy of the KL, the verb should be
حُيِّرَ.]

it is said of a man. (MF.) And بِهِ ↓ حِيرُوا [if
