حفظ1
حَفِظَهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.
حَفَظَ, (K,)
inf. n. حِفْظُ, (S, Mgh, Msb,) He kept it, preserved it, guarded it, protected it, or took care of
it; (S, K;) namely, a thing; (S;) he prevented
it from perishing, or becoming lost; (Mgh, Msb;)
namely, a thing, (Mgh,) or property &c.; (Msb;)
and hence the saying, (Mgh,) حِفْظٌ is the contr.
of نِسْيَانٌ; (M, Mgh;) i. e., it signifies the taking
care, being careful; (M;) being mind ful, regardful, attentive, or considerate: (M, K:) [see also
5:] and بِهِ ↓ احتفظ signifies the same as حَفِظَهُ.
(S, Msb.) [Hence,] you say, حَفِظَ المَالَ He kept
and tended, or pastured and defended, the camels
or the like. (K.) [And حَفِظَ حُرْمَةَ صَاحِبِهِ He
was regardful of everything entitled to reverence,
respect, honour, or defence, in the character and
appertenances of his companion, or friend.] And
حَفِظَ السِّرَّ He kept the secret. (TA.) [And
حَفِظَ يَمِينَهُ He kept his oath: but this has also
another meaning, as will be seen below.] And
حَفِظَ القُرْآنَ He kept, or retained, the Kur-án in
his mind, or memory; got it, knew it, or learned
it, by heart. (S, * Msb, K.) [See also 5.] And
حَفِظَ عِنْ فُلَانٍ [He learned by heart from such a
one: and, followed by an accus. case, the same;
or he retained in his memory, as learned, or heard,
from such a one; or he remembered to have heard
from such a one]. (TA &c. passim.) And one
says of God, قَدْ حَفِظَ عَلَى خَلْقِهِ وَعِبَادِهِ مَا يَعْمَلُونَ
مِنْ خَيْرٍ أَوْ شَرٍّ [He hath preserved from oblivion,
for, or against, his creatures and his servants,
what they do of good or evil]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also
He kept it from being used, or employed, on, or
for, ordinary, mean, or vile, occasions, or purposes. (Mgh, Msb.) You say, فُلَانٌ يَحْفَظُ نَفْسَهُ
وَلِسَانَهُ Such a one keeps himself and his tongue
from ordinary, mean, or vile, employment, in
that which does not concern him. (Mgh.) And
hence the saying in the Kur [v. 91], وَاحْفَظُوا
أَيْمَانَكُمْ, accord. to one of the modes of interpreting
it; i. e. And keep ye your oaths from being used,
or uttered, on, or for, ordinary, mean, or vile,
occasions, or purposes; agreeably with what is
said in ii. 224 of the Kur, where ordinary and
frequent swearing by God is forbidden. (Mgh.)
[Another meaning of which this phrase is susceptible has been shown above.]

[And hence,] you say, إِنَّهُ لَذُو حِفَاظٍ, and ذُو

or, accord. to Az, keep ye, attend ye, or apply
yourselves, constantly, or perseveringly, to the

(S,) [The acts of defending those whom one is
bound to respect or honour, and to defend, put

فِى لَوْحٍ مَحْفُوظٍ (TA) [Nay, it is a glorious
Kur-án, written upon a tablet preserved] from
the devils and from the alteration of anything
thereof: (Jel:) or, accord. to one reading, مَحْفُوظٌ,
this epithet being thus made to relate to the
Kur-án. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence, as an epithet in which
the quality of a subst. predominates, and then as
a subst.,] A young child; in the dial. of Mekkeh;
as a term of good omen: pl. مَحَافِيظُ. (TA.) ―
