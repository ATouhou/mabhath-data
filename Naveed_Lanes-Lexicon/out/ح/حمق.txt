―
-b2-  حَمَّقَتْهُ الهَجْعَةُ The light sleep in the first part
of the night rendered him like the أَحْمَق [i. e.
foolish, or stupid, &c.]: so says IKh; and he
cites, from a poet, the phrase حَمَّقَتْهُ بِهَجْعَةٍ; in
which the ب is redundant, and the noun occupies
the place of one in the nom. case. (TA.) ―
-b3-  [And
hence, if correct,] حُمِّقَ He drank wine: (K:) or
he became intoxicated, so that his reason departed:
thus explained by IAmb; but disallowed by EzZejjájee. (IB, TA.)

Msb;) and stagnancy, or dulness, therein; (T,
Mgh;) or deficiency, or defectiveness, therein;
(IF, Mgh;) or paucity, or want, thereof; and
↓ حُمُقٌ and ↓ حَمَاقَةٌ signify the same: (S, K:)
[all are said to be inf. ns.; but the last, accord. to
the Msb, is a simple subst.: (see 1:)] the proper
and primary signification of حُمْقٌ is [said to be]
the putting a thing in a wrong place, with knowledge of its being bad [to do so]. (TA.) [Hence,]
نَوْمَةُ الحُمْقِ The sleep after [the period of the
afternoon called] the عَصْر; when no one sleeps
except one who is intoxicated, or one who is insane, or unsound in mind. (Har p. 223. [See
also خُرْقٌ and خُلُقٌ.]) ―
-b2-  And Deceit; or a deception. (TA.) ―
-b3-  [It is said that] الحُمْقُ also
signifies Wine: (Z, K:) as being a cause of
حُمْق; like as wine is called إِثْمٌ as being a cause
of إِثْم: (Z, TA:) but Ez-Zejjájee disallows this:
and [it is also said that] ↓ الحُمَيْقَآءُ signifies the
same, because wine occasions حُمْق to its drinker.
(TA.)
حَمِقٌ: see أَحْمَقُ. ―
-b2-  Also (assumed tropical:)  Having a scanty
beard. (IDrd, K.)
حُمُقٌ: see حُمْقٌ.
حَمْقَان: see أَحْمَقُ.
حُمَاقٌ (S, K) and حَمَاقٌ (ISd, K) and ↓ حُمَيْقَى
(AZ, K) and ↓ حُمَيْقَآءُ (IDrd, K) The جُدَرِىّ [or
small-pox]: (K:) or the like thereof, (S, K,)
which attacks a human being, (S,) and spreads in
a scattered manner upon the body, or person:
(K:) accord. to Lh, a certain thing that comes
forth upon children. (TA.)
حُمَيْقٌ a contracted dim. of أَحْمَقُ; or dim. of
حَمِقٌ: [the dim. form being app. used in this
case to denote enhancement of the signification:
(see also حُمَّيْقَةٌ:)] so in the prov., (TA,) عَرَفَ
حُمَيْقٌ جَمَلَهُ [A very foolish, or stupid, man knew
his camel]; i. e. he knew thus much, although
أَحْمَق: or, as some relate it, عَرَفَ حُمَيْقًا جَمَلُهْ,
i. e. his camel knew him, [namely, a very foolish,
or stupid, man,] and emboldened himself against
him; or it means that he knew his quality: (K,
TA:) it is applied to the case of excessive familiarity with men: (TA:) or to him who deems
a man weak, and is therefore fond of annoying,
or molesting, him, (K, TA,) and ceases not to act
wrongfully towards him: or, as some say, [حميق
is here a proper name; and] this person had a
camel with which he was familiar, and he made
and attack upon him. (TA.) [See Freytag's Arab.
Prov. ii. 85.]
حَمَاقَةٌ: see حُمْقٌ.
حُمُوقَةٌ: see أُحْمُوقَةٌ.
حُمَيْقَى: see حُمَاقٌ.
حُمَيْقَآءُ: see حُمْقٌ:
-A2-  and حُمَاقٌ.
حُمَيِّقَةٌ: see what next follows.
حَمُّوقَةٌ: see what next follows.
حُمَّيْقَةٌ, (K,) but in the Tekmileh with teshdeed
to the ى and with kesr to the same, [app.
↓ حُمَّيْقَةٌ,] (TA,) and ↓ حَمُّوقَةٌ, (K,) Foolish, or
stupid, (أَحْمَق,) in the utmost degree. (Ibn-
'Abbád, K, TA.) [It seems to be implied in the
K that أُحْمُوقَةٌ signifies the same: but see this
word below.]
أَحْمَقُ (S, Mgh, Msb, K, &c.) and ↓ حَمِقٌ (S,
Msb) and ↓ حَمْقَان [whether with or without
tenween is not shown] (Sb, TA) Foolish, or stupid; i. e. unsound in intellect or understanding;
(T, Mgh, Msb;) and stagnant, or dull, therein;
(T, Mgh;) or deficient, or defective, therein;
IF, Mgh;) or haring little, or no, intellect or
understanding: (S, K:) fem. of the first حَمْقَآءُ;
(S, Msb;) and of the second حَمِقَةٌ: (TA:) pl.
of the first, applied to men and to women, (S,
K,) حُمْقٌ, (so in two copies of the S,) or حُمُقٌ,
with two dammehs, (K,) and حَمْقَى and حَمَاقَى
(S, K) and حُمَاقَى (Sgh, K) and حِمَاقٌ. (Ibn-
'Abbád, K.) Accord. to some, أَحْمَقُ is from the
phrase اِنْحَمَقَتِ السُّوقُ: and accord. to some, from
the phrase لَيَالٍ مُحْمِقَاتٌ, because the احمق deceives one at first by what he says. (TA.) The
sounds of wailing for the dead, and trilling, or
quavering, in playing, are termed أَحْمَقَانِ because
of the حُمْق of the person from whom they proceed. (Mgh.) ―
-b2-  البَقْلَةُ الحَمْقَآءُ (S, K) and
بَقْلَةُ الحَمْقَآءِ, (K,) the latter for بَقْلَةُ الحَبَّةِ الحَمْقَآءِ,
i. q. الرِّجْلَةُ [Garden purslane]; (S, ISd, K;)
which is the name applied to it by the vulgar;
(ISd, TA;) the chief of herbs, or leguminous
plants: called by those names because exuding
mucilage (مُلَعِّبَةٌ), so that it is likened to the أَحْمَق
whose slaver is flowing: IDrd says, they assert
that it is so called because it grows in the tracks
of men, so that it is trodden upon; and in water-courses, so that the water uproots it: IF says
that it is so called because of its weakness: and
it is said that some persons, hating 'Áïsheh, called
it بَقْلَةُ عَائِشَةَ; but this is one of their fanciful
assertions; for such was its name in the time of
utter paganism: so says Sgh. (TA.) ―
-b3-  [أَحْمَقُ
also signifies More, and most, foolish, or stupid,
&c. Hence,] it is said in a prov., أَحْمَقُ مِنْ رِجْلَةٍ
[More foolish, or stupid, than a plant of gardenpurslane: explained by what precedes]. (TA.)
[See also another prov. voce ثَمَانُونَ.] And in a
trad., أَحْمَقُ الحُمْقِ الفُجُورُ [The most foolish of
foolishness, or the most stupid of stupidness, is
vice, or immorality, or unrighteousness]. (A in
art. كيس.)
أَحْمُوقَةٌ is from الحُمْقُ, like أُحْدُوثَةٌ from
الحَدِيثُ, and أُعْجُوبَةٌ from العَجَبُ: (TA:) it
signifies An action, or a deed, of those that are
done by the حَمْقَى [i. e. foolish, or stupid, persons];
(Mgh;) [a foolish, or stupid, action or deed:]
it is like ↓ حُمُوقَةٌ, which means an action, a
practice, or a habit, in which is حُمْق [i. e. foolishness, or stupidity, &c.]. (TA.) One says, وَقَعَ
فُلَانٌ فِى أُحْمُوقَةٍ [Such a one fell into the commission of a foolish, or stupid, action, &c.]. (TA.)
[See حُمَّيْقَةٌ.]
مُحْمِقٌ and مُحْمِقَةٌ (S, K) A woman who brings
forth a child that is أَحْمَق [i. e. foolish, &c.];
(S;) or who brings forth حَمْقَى [i. e. foolish
children]: (K:) or, accord. to IDrd, the latter
has this signification; but the former signifies a
man who begets حَمْقَى; and he does not allow its
application to a woman. (TA.) ―
-b2-  المُحْمِقَاتُ
(tropical:)  The nights [that make a fool of one; i. e.]
during the whole of which the moon is above the
horizon but intercepted by clouds; so that one
imagines that he has arrived at the time of morning;
(A, O, K, TA;) because he sees light, but sees not
the moon: derived from الحُمْقُ. (TA.) One
says, غَرَّنِى غُرُورَ المُحْمِقَاتِ (tropical:)  [He, or it, deceived
me with the deceiving of the nights thus called].
(TA.) And you say, سِرْنَا فِى لَيَالِ مُحْمِقَاتٍ (tropical:)  [We
journeyed during such nights]; because the rider
therein thinks that he has arrived at the time
of morning until he becomes weary. (TA.)
مِحْمَاقٌ A woman who is accustomed to bring
forth حَمْقَى [i. e. foolish children]. (S, K.)
مَحْمُوقٌ A man [or child] affected with حُمَاق
[q. v.]. (A 'Obeyd, S.)
