in art. است.]

تحرّى signifies قَصَدَ الحَرَى; i. e. He
sought, or repaired to, the vicinage, quarter,
tract, or region, of a people: this is said to be
the primary signification: (Mgh:) and تحرّاهُ
he sought, or repaired to, his vicinage, &c.;
(قَصَدَ حَرَاهُ;) as also ↓ حَرَاهُ, aor. يَحْرِى: (TA:)
he aimed at it; made it his object; sought, endeavoured after, pursued, or endeavoured to
reach or attain or obtain, it; intended or purposed it; namely, a thing. (S, Mgh, Msb, K,
TA.) Hence, in the Kur [lxxii. 14], فَأُولَائِكَ
تَحَرَّوْا رَشَدًا Those have aimed at, or sought, &c.,
a right course. (S, TA.) And تَحَرَّيْتُ مَرْضَاتَهُ I
aimed at, or sought, &c., his approval. (Mgh.)
And the trad., تَحَرَّوْا لَيْلَةَ القَدْرِ فِى العَشْرِ الأَوَاخِرِ
Seek ye the Night of القدر in the last ten [nights
of Ramadán]. (TA.) — Also He sought what
was most meet, suitable, fit, proper, or deserving,
(S, Mgh, Msb, K,) to be done, (S, K,) of two
things, (Mgh, Msb,) according to the opinion
predominating in his mind, (S,) فِى الأَمْرِ [in the
affair, or case]: (Msb:) or he sought, or endeavoured, and strove in seeking, and deciding
upon, the singling out of a thing, by deed and
by word. (TA.) — And He tarried, waited,
or paused in expectation, بِالمَكَانِ in the place.
(S, K.)
حَرًى The vicinage, quarter, tract, or region,
(As, T, S, IAth, Mgh, K,) of a man, (As, T,
IAth,) or of a people; (Mgh;) the environs (As,
T, S) of a man, (As, T,) or of a house; (S;) and
↓ حَرَاةٌ signifies the same: (S, K:) and [it is
said that] the former signifies also the place of
the eggs of an ostrich: (S, K:) and a covert, or
hiding-place, among trees, of a gazelle: (K, * TA:)
Lth says that it signifies the place of laying eggs
of the ostrich; or the covert, or lodging-place, of
the gazelle: but this is false; for with the Arabs
the word signifies as explained above on the
authority of As and the حرى of the place of
laying eggs of the ostrich, and of the covert of
the gazelle, is the environs thereof: (T, TA:)
pl. أَحْرَآءٌ. (K.) You say, اِذْهَبْ فَلَا أَرَيَنَّكَ بِحَرَاىَ
and ↓ حَرَاتِى [Go thou, so that I may by no
means see thee in my vicinage, &c.]. (S.) And
لَا تَطُرْ حَرَانَا Approach not thou our environs.
(S.) And نَزَلْتُ بِحَرَاهُ and بِعَرَاهُ [I alighted, or
descended and abode, in his vicinage, &c.]. (S.)
-A2-  See also حَرِىٌّ, in six places.
حَرٍ: see حَرِىٌّ, in four places.
حَرَاةٌ: see حَرًى, in two places.
حَرِىٌّ Adapted, disposed, apt, meet, suited,
suitable, fitted, fit, competent, proper, or worthy;
as also ↓ حَرٍ and ↓ حَرًى, which last has no dual
nor pl., (S, Msb, K,) nor a fem. form, remaining
unaltered, because it is [originally] an inf. n.; [see
a verse cited voce نَقْرٌ;] or, accord. to Lh, one
may say حَرَيَانِ, because Ks has related that some
of the Arabs dualize what they do not pluralize:
(TA:) the pl. of حَرِىٌّ is حَرِيُّونَ and أَحْرِيَآءُ;
(S, Msb;) and the pl. of حَرِيَّةٌ is حَرِيَّاتٌ and حَرَايَا:
the pl. of ↓ حَرٍ is أَحْرَآءٌ (S, TA) and حَرُونَ; and
the pl. of حَرِيَةٌ is حَرِيَاتٌ. (TA.) You say, إِنَّهُ
لَحَرِىٌّ بِكَذَا, and ↓ لَحَرِ, and ↓ لَحَرًى, (K, TA,)
Verily he, or it, is adapted, &c., to such a thing;
or worthy of such a thing. (TA.) And هُوَ حَرِىٌّ
أَنْ يَفْعَلَ ذَاكَ, and ↓ حَرٍ, and ↓ حَرًى, He is adapted,
&c., to do that: (S, Msb:) and ان ↓ انّه لَمَحْرًى
يفعل, (Lh, K, [in some copies of the K, erroneously, لَمَحْرِىٌّ,]) and ↓ لَمَحْرَاةٌ, (K,) which last
has no dual nor pl. nor fem. form, like مَخْلَقَةٌ
[q. v.] and مَقْمَنَةٌ: (TA:) and ↓ هٰذَا الأَمْرُ مَحْرَاةٌ
لِذٰلِكَ [This thing, or affair, is adapted, &c., to
that]. (S.) And hence the phrase, أَنْ ↓ بِالْحَرَى
يَكُونَ ذَاكَ (S, * K) It is suitable, fit, or proper,
that that should be. (PS.) [But this phrase, in
the present day, means Rather that should be.
And hence, ↓ كَمْ بِالحَرَى How much rather.]
One says also, of a man who has attained to fifty
[years], ↓ فَحَرًى, meaning He is adapted, &c., to
attain all that is good. (Th, TA.) And one says
إِنَّهُ لَحَرِىٌّ as meaning Verily it is probable; or
likely to happen or be, or to have happened or
been; as also لَخَلِيقٌ. (TA in art. خلق.)
حِرِىٌّ: see art. حرح.
حَارٍ masc. of حَارِيَةٌ, (M, TA,) which is an epithet applied to a viper (أَفْعًى); (S, M, K;) meaning That has decreased in its body by reason of
age; and it is the worst, or most malignant or
noxious, that is: (S:) or that has become old, and
has wasted in its body, and whereof there remains
not save its head and its breath (نَفَسُهَا [in the
CK نَفْسُهَا]) and its poison: (M, K:) dim. ↓ حُوَيْرٍ.
(TA.) One says, رَمَاكَ اللّٰهُ بِأَفْعًى حَارِيَةٍ [meaning
(assumed tropical:)  May God smile thee with an evil like a viper
wasted by age]. (S.)
حُوَيْرٍ: see what next precedes.
أَحْرَى More, and most, adapted, disposed, apt,
meet, suited, suitable, fitted, fit, competent, or
proper; or more, and most, worthy, or deserving.
(S, * Mgh, Msb, K.) A thing is said to be أَحْرَى
بِالِاسْتِعْمَالِ [More, or most, meet, &c., to be done].
(S, K.)
مَحْرًى: see حَرِىٌّ.
مَحْرَاةٌ: see حَرِىٌّ, in two places.
