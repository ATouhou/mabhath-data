certain portion or appertenance] of the stomach
of a ruminant animal, that which has طَرَائِق
[meaning either furrows or streaks, but more
probably the former], as though it, or they,
(كَأَنَّهَا,) were the coverings (أَطْبَاق) of the feces
in the stomach: (Az, L:) or that [part] which
has coverings (أَطْبَاق [or probably this signifies
here folds, one above another,]) at the lower part
of the stomach of a ruminant, towards the side
of the latter, from which the feces of the stomach
never pass forth: [app. meaning the third stomach,
or omasum; commonly called the manyplies,
because of its many plies, or folds, and strata
super strata; and by some, the millet; from
which the food, being already ruminated, does
not pass out again to the mouth, as it does from
the first and second stomachs:] it pertains to the
camel, and to the sheep and goat, and oxen; or,
accord. to IAar, [only] to the sheep and goat:
