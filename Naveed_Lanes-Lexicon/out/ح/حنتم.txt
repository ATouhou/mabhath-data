حنتمحَنْتَمٌ A green جَرَّة [or jar], (S, K,) to which
some add, including to redness: (TA:) or winejars, (A 'Obeyd, Nh,) glazed, or varnished, green,
(Nh,) which used to be carried to El-Medeeneh,
with wine in them: (A 'Obeyd, Nh:) the use of
which, for preparing نَبِيذ therein, is forbidden in
a trad., because it quickly became potent in them,
by reason of the glazing, or varnish; or, as some
say, because they used to be made of clay kneaded
with blood and hair; but the former is the right
reason: afterwards applied to any jars, or pottery: (Nh:) thus some explain it as a sing.;
(MF;) and the pl. is حَنَاتِمُ: (Az, TA:) others,
as a pl. [or coll. gen. n.], of which the sing. [or
n. un.] is with ة: (MF:) some say that the ن is
augmentative: so says the author of the Msb:
others, that it is radical. (TA.) [See art. حتم.]
―
-b2-  Black clouds; (Az, K;) as also [the pl.]
حَنَاتِمُ: (Az, S, K:) because, with the Arabs,
السَّوَادُ is [used for] خُضْرَةٌ: (S: [see أَسْوَدُ; and
see also حَنْتَمٌ in art. حتم:]) or as being likened
to حَنَاتِم (meaning jars) filled [with water]: (Az,
TA:) n. un. with ة. (K.) ―
-b3-  The colocynthplant; (K, TA;) because of its intense greenness:
n. un. with ة. (TA.)
