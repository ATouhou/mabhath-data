حيك1
حَاكَ, aor. يَحِيكُ, inf. n. حَيْكٌ and حَيَكٌ and
حِيَاكَةٌ, accord. to Lth, signifies He wove a piece
of cloth: [and it is said in the K, in art. حوك,
that the root of the verb in this sense is with و
and with ى:] but Az says that this is a mistake;
and that the verb is only حاك having for its
aor. يَحُوكُ, inf. n. حَوْكٌ. (TA. [See, however,
what follows.])
-A2-  حاك, (S, K,) or حاك فِى مِشْيَتِهِ,
(TA,) aor. يَحِيكُ, inf. n. حَيَكَانٌ (S, K) and
حَيْكٌ (K) and حَيَكَى (Mbr, TA) [and حِيَاكَةٌ,
which see in what follows], He (a man, TA)
walked with an elegant and a proud and selfconceited gait, with an affected inclining of the
body from side to side, or with a twisting of the
back: or he moved about his shoulder-joints and
his body in walking, (K, TA,) having much
flesh; which manner of walking in women is
commended, but in men it is discommended;
for the woman walks thus by reason of the largeness of her thighs; but the man, when his thighs,
or legs, are wide apart: or, as some say, it signifies he trod the ground vehemently: (TA:)
or he moved about his shoulder-joints, and parted
his legs widely, in walking, [as short persons do:
for] حَيَكَانٌ signifies the manner of walking
of him who is short: (S:) or a walking in
which a man moves about his posteriors: all
which meanings are borrowed from the action
of the حَائِك [or weaver, who straddles when at
work]: حِيَاكَةٌ, likewise, signifies a walking with
an elegant and a proud and self-conceited gait,
with an affected inclining of the body from side
to side, or with a twisting of the back, and in
a lagging manner. (TA.) And you say also,
↓ جآءَ يَتَحَيَّكُ, and ↓ يَتَحَايَكُ, meaning He came
walking with his legs parted as though there were
something between them. (TA.)
-A3-  حاك, (K,)
aor. يَحِيكُ, inf. n. حَيْكٌ, (TA,) said of a sword,
(K,) and of an axe, (TA,) It made an impression,
or had effect; as also ↓ احاك. (K, TA.) حاك فِيهِ
(S) and فيه ↓ احاك (S, K) and ↓ اَحاكهُ, (K,)
said of a sword, signify the same: (S, K:) one
says, فِيهِ السَّيْفَ ↓ ضَرَبَهُ فَمَا أَحَاكَ, i. e. [He struck
him, but the sword] made no impression, or had
no effect, upon him. (S, TA.) And حَاكَت الشَّفْرَةُ
The [knife called] شفرة cut; as also ↓ احاكت.
(K.) And ما تَحِيكُ المُدْيَةُ اللَّحْمَ [The butcher's
knife does not cut the flesh-meat], and ما تحيك فِيهِ:
both signify alike. (El-Ámidee, TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,]
حاك القَوْلُ فِى القَلْبِ, inf. n. حَيْكٌ, (assumed tropical:)  The saying
took effect upon the heart; (Sh, S, K, TA;) and
became fixed therein. (Sh, TA.) And مَا يَحِيكُ
فِيهِ المَلَامُ (assumed tropical:)  Blame does not make any impression
upon him. (S.) And مَا يَحِيكُ كَلَامُكَ فِى فلَانٍ
(assumed tropical:)  Thy speech does not make any impression upon
such a one. (TA.) And it is said [in a trad., as
some read it], الإِثْمُ مَا حَاكَ فِى صَدْرِكَ وَكَرِهْتَ
أَنْ يَطَّلِعَ عَلَيْهِ النَّاسُ (assumed tropical:)  Sin is that which makes an
impression upon thy mind, and becomes fixed
[therein, and with which thou dislikest that men
should become acquainted]. (Az, TA. [See also
حَكَّ; and see حَزَّ.])
