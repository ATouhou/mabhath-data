حَرَضَ, (Msb, K,) inf. n.
حَرَضٌ, (Msb,) His stomach became in a corrupt,
or disordered, state: (K:) or he (a man) became
in a corrupt, or disordered, state, and sick, or
diseased, so as to defile himself in his clothes:
[see حَرَضٌ, below:] or he became emaciated (lit.
dissolved) by grief, or by excessive love: (S:) or
he became at the point of death: (Msb:) and
he suffered protracted disquietude of mind, and

he became heavily oppressed by disease; or constantly affected thereby so as to be at the point of
death: (K:) or this last form of the verb signifies

-b2-  [Hence, app.,]
حَرُضَ, and حَرَضَ, aor.
حَرُضَ, inf. n. حُرُوضٌ, as in
the L; not حَرِضَ, as in the K (assumed tropical:)  He was, or
became, low, base, mean, or sordid; unable to
rise from, or quit, his place; a signification given
in the K to حَرِضَ: or low, base, mean, or sordid;
possessing no good: (TA:) [but of the correctness
of one of the two forms here mentioned on the
authority of the L, the author of the TA expresses
a bout: app. with respect to the latter of them;
for it is said,] حَرُضَ, inf. n. حَرَاضَةٌ and حُرُوضَةٌ
and حُرُوضٌ, also signifies he (a man, TA) was, or
became, low, base, mean, or sordid, and bad, corrupt, or vicious, and neglected, or forsaken; (K,
TA;) as also حَرِضَ. (K: but only the former,
حَرُضَ, is given in this sense in the TA.)

2

-A2-  Also, inf. n. تَحْرِيضٌ, He
rendered him free from, or rid him of, حَرَض [q. v.];
like as قَذَّيْتُهُ signifies “ I rid him of what is
termed قَذًى. ” (TA.) [Thus it bears two contr.
significations.] ―
-b2-  And, [hence, perhaps,] (ISd,
A, &c.,) inf. n. as above, (S, ISd, A, &c.,) He
excited, incited, urged, or instigated, him, (Zj, S,
ISd, K,) and roused him to ardour, (S,) عَلَى
القِتَالِ to fight, (Zj, S,) or عَلَى الشَّىْءِ to do the
thing, (A, * Msb,) in order that he might be
known to be such as is termed حَارِض if he held
back from it: (Zj:) so in the Kur [iv. 86 and]
viii. 66: (Zj:) or he excited, incited, urged, or
instigated, him to apply himself constantly, or
perseveringly, to fight: (TA:) [see 3:] and
عَلَى الشَّىْءِ ↓ أَحْرَضَهُ, inf. n. إِحْرَاضٌ, signifies the

K:) and على القِتَالِ to fight. (Lh.)

احرضهُ It (disease, A, TA) pressed heavily
upon him; or clave to him constantly: it caused
him to be at the point of death; as also ↓ حَرَضَهُ:
it corrupted, or disordered, his body, so that he
became on the brink of death. (TA: [in which
this last signification is said to be tropical: but
accord. to the A, it is evidently not so.]) It
(food) caused him to be sick, or diseased. (A.)
It (love, AO, S) corrupted, or disordered, him.
(AO, S, K.) ―
-b2-  (tropical:)  He corrupted, vitiated, marred,
or destroyed, it; namely, a thing; as also ↓ حرّضهُ:

حَرِضَ, (K,) inf. n.
حَرْضٌ, (TA,) (tropical:)  He corrupted, or vitiated, or destroyed, himself, or his own soul: (K, * TA:) and
احرض نَفْسَهُ (assumed tropical:)  he destroyed himself, or his own
soul, by telling a lie. (TA.) And سُوْءُ حَمْلِ الفَاقَةِ
يُحْرِضُ الحَسَبَ, occurring in a saying of Aktham
Ibn-Seyfee, means (assumed tropical:)  The ill-bearing of poverty
annuls the grounds of pretension to respect. (TA.)
-A2-  احرضهُ عَلَى الشَّىْءِ: see 2.
-A3-  احرض (assumed tropical:)  He (a
man) begat evil offspring. (S, K.)
حَرْضٌ: see حَرَضٌ, last sentence:
-A2-  and see also
what here follows.
حُرْضٌ, (Mgh,) or ↓ حُرُضٌ, (Msb,) or both, (S,
K,) the former mentioned by Sb, but in some of
the copies of his book written with fet-h (↓ حَرْضٌ),
i. q. شَجَرُ الأُشْنَانِ [The trees, or plants, from
which potash is obtained; the kind of plants
called kali, or glasswort, &c.]; which are of the
kind called نَجِيل: (Az, TA:) Aboo-Ziyád says
that what is termed حُرْض is slender in the extremities (دُقَاقُ الأَطْرَافِ), but its tree is large,
being sometimes used for shade, and affords firewood, and it is that with which people wash
clothes; and he adds, we have not seen any حُرْض
purer or whiter than some which grows in ElYemámeh, in a valley thereof called جَوُّ الخَضَارِمِ:
(TA:) i. q. أُشْنَانٌ [q. v.]; (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K;)
with which the hands are washed after food.
(TA. [But see حَرَّاضٌ.]) So in the Kur [xii. 85],
accord. to one reading, (K,) the reading of El-
Hasan El-Basree, (Sgh,) ↓ حَتَّى تَكُونَ حُرُضًا,
(Bd,) meaning Until thou be like اشنان in dryness; as explained in the K, except that نُحُولًا is
there erroneously put for قُحُولًا: (TA:) but EsSuddee disapproved of this reading. (Sgh.)
-A2-
Also حُرْضٌ, [and app. حُرُضٌ also,] i. q. جِصٌّ [or
Gypsum]. (TA.)
حَرَضٌ Corruptness in the body, and in the
intellect, (Ibn-'Arafeh, A, K,) and (assumed tropical:)  in one's
course of conduct, or tenets. (Ibn-'Arafeh, K.)
[See 1.]
-A2-  A man in a corrupt, or disordered,
state, and sick, or diseased, (S, K,) so that he
defiles himself (يُحْدِثُ [but in some copies of the
S this word is omitted]) in his clothes; (S;) as
also ↓ حَارِضَةٌ and ↓ حَارِضٌ and ↓ حَرِضٌ; (K;)
↓ which last also signifies a man having his
stomach in a corrupt, or disordered, state; and
suffering protracted disquietude of mind, and
disease: (TA:) also the first, (حَرَضٌ,) weary,
or fatigued: (K:) and at the point of death;
(Msb, K;) as also ↓ حَاِرضٌ; (K;) which last
also signifies one near to dying, or to perishing;
and having his body corrupted, or disordered,
by disease, so as to be at the point of death, and
so ↓ حَرِضٌ; (TA;) and [in like manner] ↓ مُحْرَضٌ
signifies dying, or perishing, from disease, being
neither living so as to be an object of hope, nor
dead so as to be an object of despair: (T, TA:)
حَرَضٌ also signifies emaciated (lit. dissolved) by
grief, or by excessive love; (AA accord. to the
S, or AO accord. to the TA, and K;) as also
↓ مُحْرَضٌ, (S,) or ↓ مُحَرَّضٌ: (K:) and heavily
oppressed by disease; or constantly affected thereby
so as to be at the point of death: so in the Kur
xii. 85: (K:) [in the CK, حَرَضًا is her erroneously put for مَرَضًا:] or it there signifies heavily
pressed upon by disease; or affected by constant
disease: (AZ:) or extremely aged; or old and
weak: (Katádeh:) and anything withering:
(TA:) [the following observation, which is inserted in the S after the first of the significations
here given of حَرَضٌ used as an epithet, and in the
K after a later signification which is said to be
tropical, applies to it, when so used, in all its
senses:] it is employed alike as sing. as pl. (Fr,
S, K) and masc. (Fr) and fem.; (Fr, K;) being
originally an inf. n.: (Fr, Msb:) or, like every inf. n. used as an epithet, it is for ذُو followed by
the inf. n., and therefore has no dual nor pl.
form: (Zj:) but some of the Arabs use ↓ حَارِضٌ
as an epithet applied to a male, and ↓ حَارِضَةٌ as
applied to a female; and these have duals and
pls.: (Fr:) and sometimes حَرَضٌ has pls.; namely
أَحْرَاضٌ; (K;) which is also pl. of حَرِضٌ and of
حَارِضٌ; or, accord. to the L, it is allowable as a
pl. of حَرِضٌ, in the place of the more common
pl. حَرِضُونَ; (TA;) and ↓ حُرْضَانِ; (K;) which
is more approved; (TA;) and حَرِضَةٌ. (K: [this
last being expressly said in the TA to be thus
written, but in the CK it is written حَرَضَة.]) ―
-b2-
Also, applied to a man, (A,) (tropical:)  Possessing no
good; (A, K;) like ↓ حَارِضَةٌ, (TA,) which latter
is explained by As as signifying a man in whom
is no good: (T, TA:) or the former, one whose
good is not hoped for, nor his evil feared: (K:)
and a bad man: (K:) and low, base, mean, or
sordid; unable to rise from, or quit, his place;
as also ↓ حَرِيضٌ and ↓ حَرِضٌ and ↓ مُحَرَّضٌ, (K,
[this last, in the CK, written مُحَرِّض,]) or
↓ مُحْرَضٌ, (TA,) and ↓ إِحْرِيضٌ: (K:) or low,
base, mean, or sordid; in whom is no good:
(TA:) and [in like manner] ↓ حَارِضٌ signifies
bad, corrupt, or vitious, and neglected, or forsaken; (K;) and so ↓ مَحْرُوضٌ, (TA,) and
↓ حِرْضَةٌ, of which the pl. is حِرَضٌ; (TA;)
↓ مَحْرُوضٌ also signifying made, or asserted, to be
low, base, mean, or sordid; (K, TA;) and so
↓ حَارِضٌ, and ↓ حِرْضَةٌ; and this last signifying
also having in him no good: (TA:) and حَرَضٌ
likewise signifies one who does not take to himself
arms, nor fight: (Lth, K:) its pl. is أَحْرَاضٌ
(A, TA) and ↓ حُرْضَانٌ: (TA:) both these pls.
signify weak men, who will not fight: (S:) and
the former of them is explained as signifying the
lowest, basest, or meanest, sort of mankind: and
men corrupt in their course of conduct, or tenets:
also the latter of them as signifying men who
know not the place of their chief: and ↓ حَارِضٌ,
of which the fem. is with ة, signifies a stupid
man. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Also, applied to a she-camel,
Lean, or emaciated: (K, TA:) and ↓ حُرْضَانٌ,
so applied, vile: and perishing, or dying; in
which sense it is likewise applied to a male camel.
(TA.) ―
-b4-  Also, applied to language, or speech,
(assumed tropical:)  Bad; (K;) and so, by poetic license, ↓ حَرْضٌ;
or this, accord. to Sgh, is a dial. var.: (L, TA:)
and perishing: pl. أَحْرَاضٌ. (TA.)

beginning: ―

them forth, (الَّذِى يَضْرِبُ بِالقِدَاحِ, S, or يُفِيضُ
القِدَاحَ, A,) for the players in the game called
المَيْسِر, (S, A,) in order that he may eat of their
meat [without having contributed to pay for the
slaughtered camel]: (A:) like him who is termed
بَرَمٌ, (S, A,) always a low, or mean, person, (S,)
an object of dispraise: (A:) called thus because
of his lowness, or meanness. (L.) ―

makes a fire upon حُرْض for the purpose of procuring from it قِلْى; (S;) i. e. for the dyers;
and ↓ إِحْرِيضٌ also signifies one who makes a fire
upon أُشْنَان [or حُرْض]: it is said that [plants of
the kind called] حَمْض are burned, in their fresh
state, and then water is sprinkled upon their
ashes, which in consequence are compacted, and
become قِلْى [q. v.]. (TA.) ―
