حَصُرَ, (S,

ISk, S, Msb, or a people, K) encompassed him,
or surrounded him, (Msb, K,) and prevented him
from going to his business: (Msb:) or straitened
him, and encompassed or surrounded him; as also
↓ حَاصَرَهُ, inf. n. مُحَاصَرَةٌ and حِصَارٌ. (ISK, S.)
The ↓ محاصرة of an enemy is well known. (K.)
You say العَدُوُّ ↓ حَاصَرَهُمُ, inf. ns. as above, [The
enemy besieged, or beset, them;] and بَقِينَا فِى
الحِصَارِ أَيَّامًا We remained in the state of siege
some days; or in the place of confinement; and
حُوصِرُوا مُحَاصَرَةً شَدِيدَةً [They were besieged, or
beset, vehemently]. (A.) ―
-b2-  Also حَصَرَهُ, (S, A,
K, &c.,) aor.
حَصُرَ (Mgh, K) and
حَصِرَ, (K,) inf. n.
حَصْرٌ, (A, Mgh, K,) He, (Akh, S, A,) or it, (S,)
confined, kept close, imprisoned, detained, retained,
restrained, withheld, or prevented, him; (A O,
Aboo-'Amr Esh-Sheybánee, Akh, S, A;) as also
↓ أَحْصَرَهُ: (Aboo-' Amr Esh-Sheybánee, S:) or a
distinction should be made between these two
forms, as will be seen in what follows. (TA.)
And It (a hostile party, and a disease, ISK, Th,
Msb) detained, restrained, withheld, or prevented,
him (ISK, Th, Msb, K) from journeying &c.;
(K;) as also ↓ احصرهُ: (AO, * ISk, Th, Msb, K:)
or the latter signifies it (disease) prevented him
from journeying, or from a thing that he desired:
so in the Kur ii. 192: (ISk, S:) or [more properly] it (disease, or urine, [&c.,]) made him to
restrain himself: (Akh, S, K:) or إِحْصَارٌ signifies
the being prevented from attending the religious
rites and ceremonies of the pilgrimage, by disease, or the like: (IAth:) or أُحْصِرَ is said when
a man is turned back from a course which he
desired: and حُصِرَ, when he is confined, or restrained, or the like: (Yoo:) or, accord. to Fr,
the Arabs say, of him whom fear or disease prevents from accomplishing his pilgrimage or his
عُمْرَة [q. v.], (Mgh, * TA,) and of any one that is
not forcibly constrained, as by imprisonment, or
by enchantment or the like, (TA,) ↓ أُحْصِرَ: and
of him who is imprisoned or restrained by a
Sultán, or by one who overpowers, حُصِرَ: this
distinction is observed by them: (Mgh, * TA:)
but if you mean that the constraining power of
the Sultán is a preventing cause, and you do not
refer to the act of the agent, it is allowable for
you to say, الرَّجُلُ ↓ قَدْ أُحْصِرَ: and if you say of
him whom pain or disease makes to restrain himself, that the disease, or fear, restrains him, it is
allowable for you to say, حُصِرَ: or, as Aboo-Is-
hák the Grammarian says, the correct rule, accord.
to the lexicologists, is, that one says of him whom
fear and disease prevent, ↓ أُحْصِرَ: and of him who
is confined or restrained by another, حُصِرَ: and
thus it is because he who refrains from conducting
himself freely in an affair restrains himself: and
they saying حَصَرْتُهُ means that thou hast restrained
him; not that he has restrained himself: so that
it is allowable to say in this case [when you do
not mention the agent], ↓ أُحْصِرَ. (TA.) [Accord.
to Z,] حُصِرَ عَنْهُ and دُونَهُ [lit. He was withheld
from it] is said when a man is ashamed at a thing,
and leaves it, or abstains from it, or when he is
unable to effect a thing, or finds his wish difficult
of attainment. (A. [See also حَصِرَ, in what follows, in this paragraph.]) حَصَرْتُ الغُرَمَآءَ فِى المَالِ
means حَصَرْتُ قِسْمَةَ المَالِ فِى الغُرَمَآءِ [I restricted
the division of the property among the creditors]:
for the prevention is not against them, but against
others, from their being shares with them in the
property: the phrase is inverted, like أَدْخَلْتُ
القَبْرَ المَيِّتَ. (Msb.) ―

is a simple subst.], (Ibn-Buzurj,) He (a man,
S, A) suffered suppression of the feces, or constipation of the bowels: (Ks, Ibn-Buzurj, S, A,

confusion of mind, or other [accidental] cause;

صُدُورُهُمْ أَنْ يُقَاتِلُوكُمْ means عَنْ قِتَالِكُمْ [Or who
come to you, their bosoms being contracted so that
they are incapable of fighting you; or their
bosoms shrinking from fighting you]: (TA:) Akh
and the Koofees allow that the pret. here may be
a denotative of state; but Sb does not allow this
use of the pret. unless with قَدْ; and he makes
حصرت صدورهم to be an imprecation [meaning
may their bosoms become contracted]: (S:) accord.
to Fr, the Arabs say, أَتَانِى فُلَانٌ ذَهَبَ عَقْلُهُ,
meaning قَدْ ذهب عقله: Zj says, Fr makes حصرت
a denotative of state; but it is not so unless with
قد: They says that if قد be understood, it approximates to a denotative of state, and becomes like
a noun; and some read حَصِرَةً صُدُورُهُمْ: AZ does
not allow this use of the pret. [as a denotative of
state] unless preceded by وَ or قد. (TA.) ―
