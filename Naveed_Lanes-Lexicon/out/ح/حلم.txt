حُلْمٌ an inf. n. of حَلَمَ; as also ↓ حُلُمٌ. (Msb.)
―
-b2-  And A dream, or vision in sleep; (S, K;) as
also ↓ حُلُمٌ: (K:) accord. to most of the lexicologists, as well as F, syn. with رُؤْيَا: or it is

this is corroborated by the trad., الرُّؤْيَا مِنَ اللّٰهِ
وَالحُلْمُ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ [The رؤيا is from God, and
the حلم is from the Devil]: (MF:) and by the
phrase, in the Kur [xii. 44 and xxi. 5], أَضْغَاثُ
أَحْلَامٍ [The confused circumstances of dreams,
or of evil dreams]: but each is used in the place
of the other: (TA:) أَحْلَامٌ is the pl. (K.) ―

(TA:) or tranquillity on the occasion of emotion

(KT:) it is described by the term ثِقَلٌ, or gravity;
like as its contr. [سَفَهٌ] is described by the terms
خِقَّةٌ and عَجَلٌ, or levity, or lightness, and hastiness: (TA in art. رجح:) also (assumed tropical:)  intelligence;
(K;) which is not its proper signification, but a
meaning assigned because it is one of the results
of intelligence: and ↓ حَلْمٌ, with fet-h, is likewise said to have this last meaning; but this
requires consideration: (TA:) the former is one
of those inf. ns. that are [used as simple substs.,
and therefore] pluralized: (ISd, TA:) the pl.
[of pauc.] is أَحْلَامٌ and [of mult.] حُلُومٌ. (K.)
Hence, in the Kur [lii. 32], أَمْ تَأْمُرُهُمْ أَحْلَامُهُمْ

is حِلَامٌ. (TA.)

[xxiv. 58], وَإِذَا بَلَغَ الأَطْفَالُ مِنْكُمُ الحُلُمَ فَلْيَسْتَأْذِنُوا
[And when your children attain to puberty, or
virility, they shall ask permission to come into
your presence]. (TA.) [And hence,] أَضْرَاسُ
الحُلُمِ, (also called أَضْرَاسُ العَقْلِ, TA in art. ضرس,)
[The teeth of puberty, or wisdom-teeth,] so called
because they grow after the attaining to puberty,

growth; for at first, when small, it is called
قَمْقَامَةٌ; then, حَمْنَانَةٌ; then, قُرَادٌ; and then,
حَلَمَةٌ: (As, TA:) the pl., (S,) or [rather] coll.
gen. n., (Mgh, Msb,) is ↓ حَلَمٌ. (S, Mgh, Msb.)
―
-b2-  And hence, as being likened thereto, (Mgh,)
(assumed tropical:)  The head [or nipple, when small,] of a woman's
breast, (T, S, Mgh,) in the middle of the سَعْدَانَة
[or areola]; (T, TA;) in like manner called

in Nejd, in the sands, has a blossom, and roughish
leaves, and thorns resembling the nails of a man;
and that the camels suffer adhesion of the spleen
to the side, and their young are cast, [for وتزل
اخياكها (an evident mistranscription in the TA),
I read وَتزِلُّ أَحْبَالُها,] when they depasture it from
the dry branches: accord. to AHn, it is [a plant]
less than a cubit [in height], having a thick, or
rough, leaf, and branches, and a flower like that
of the anemone, except that it is larger, and
thicker, or rougher: accord. to the K, it signifies
also the tree [or plant] called سَعْدَان; which is
one of the most excellent kinds of pasture: but
Az says, it has nothing in common with the
سعدان, which is a herb having round [heads of]
prickles; whereas the حلمة has no prickles, but
is a well-known kind of جَنْبَة; and I have seen it:
