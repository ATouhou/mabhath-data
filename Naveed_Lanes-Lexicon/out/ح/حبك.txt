حبك1
حَبَكَهُ, aor.
حَبِكَ (S, K) and
حَبُكَ, (K,) inf. n. حَبْكٌ,
(S, K,) He bound it, or tied it; and made it fast,
or firm: (K: [see also 2:]) he made it well:
(TA:) he wove it well, (S, K, TA,) and firmly,
or compactly; (TA;) namely, a piece of cloth:
(S, K, TA:) he made the effect of the work
therein to be beautiful; i. e., in a piece of cloth:
and ↓ احتبكهُ signifies the same: (K:) or this
latter, he made it (i. e. anything) firm, or compact; and made it well. (IAar, S, Msb.) It is
said of ' Áïsheh, in a trad., تَحْتَ ↓ كَانَتْ تَحْتَبِكَ
الدِرْعِ فِى الصَّلَاةِ She used to bind the إِزَار [or
waist-wrapper], and make it fast, beneath the
shift, in prayer; (S;) from حُبْكَةٌ, q. v.: (TA:)
or بِإِزَارٍ فَوْقَ القَمِيصِ ↓ كَانَتْ فِى الصَّلَاةِ تَحْتَبِكُ
she used, in prayer, to bind an ازار over the shirt.
(Msb.) [It is said that] ↓ اِحْتِبَاكٌ is also syn.
with اِحْتِبَآءٌ, on the authority of As: (S:) [i. e.,
that] احتبك is syn. with احتبى: (Msb:) [and
that] احتبك بِإِزَارِهِ signifies احتبى, (K,) or احتبى
بِهِ وَ شَدَّهُ إِلَى يَدَيْهِ: so says Aboo-' Obeyd, as on
the authority of As: but Az says that this is a
mistake: that what As said was, that الاحتياك,
with ى, is syn. with الاحتباء, as ISk relates.
(TA.) One says also, حَبَكْتُ الحَظِيرَةَ بِقَصَبَاتِ
كَمَ تُحْبَكُ عُرُوشُ الكَرْمِ بِالحِبَالِ [I bound the enclosure for cattle with canes, or reeds, (or perhaps
we should read بِقُضْبَانٍ, i. e. with twigs,) like
as the trellises of the grape-vine are bound with
cords: see also the last sentence of this paragraph]. (Az, TA.) ―
-b2-  [In the present day, حَبَكَ
also signifies He sewed the leaves of a book: and
he bound a book.]
-A2-  حَبْكٌ also signifies The act
of cutting: and smiting [or severing] the neck.

sword: or he cut the flesh [or his flesh] above

إِحْتَبَكَ see 1, in four places; and see حُبْكَةٌ.
ذَاتِ الحُبْكِ and الحِبْكِ and الحَبَكِ and الحُبَكِ
and الحُبُكِ and الحُبِكِ (TA) and الحِبَكِ (Bd in
li. 7] and الحِبُكِ and الحِبِكِ (TA) are various
readings in the Kur [li. 7]: الحُبْك is a contraction of الحُبُك, of the dial. of Benoo-Temeem:
الحِبْك is a contraction of الحِبِك: الحَبَك is as
though its sing., or n. un., were حَبَكَةٌ: الحُبَك is
as though its sing. were حُبْكَةٌ: الحُبُك is the
common reading, and is pl. of حِبَاكٌ [q. v.] or
of حَبِيكَةٌ: الحُبِك is of a form unused [in any
other instance]: (TA:) الحِبَك is like النِّعَم [as
though its sing. were حِبْكَةٌ]: (Bd:) الحِبُك is
affirmed to be a mixture of two dial. vars.:
الحِبِك is of a rare measure, like إِبِلٌ &c. (TA.)
حُبْكَةٌ i. q. حُجْزَةٌ [i. e. The part of the إِزَار (or
waist-wrapper) where it is tied round the waist;
which part is folded, or doubled]: (Sh, K:)
whence ↓ الاِحْتِبَاكُ, meaning “ the binding, or
tying, the ازار: ” or the folds of the حُجْزَة, let
down, before the wearer, for the purpose of his
carrying anything therein. (TA.) And An ازار
[itself]; as also ↓ حِبَاكٌ. (Ham p. 37.) And A
cord, or rope, which one binds on the waist:
(K:) and ↓ حِبَاكٌ [also] signifies a cord, or rope,
or an ازار, or other thing, with which the waist
is bound; pl. حُبُكٌ: whence the saying, عَقَدَ
فُلَانٌ حُبُكَ النِّطَاقِ, meaning (tropical:)  Such a one prepared
himself to go away; or applied himself exclusively and diligently to an affair. (Har p. 160.)
And The thong (القِدَّةُ [in the CK, erroneously,
القِدَّةُ]) that connects the head to the [pieces of
wood called] غَرَاضِيف, of the [camel's saddle
called] قَتَب, (K, TA,) and of the [saddle called]
رَحْل; (TA;) as also ↓ حِبَاكٌ. (K.) Pl. (of the
former, TA) حُبَكٌ and (of the latter, TA)
حُبُكٌ. (K.)
حِبَاكٌ: see حُبْكَةٌ, in three places. ―
-b2-  Also An
enclosure for cattle (حَظِيرَة), [made] with canes,
or reeds, (بِقَصَبَاتٍ, [or perhaps we should read
بِقُضْبَانٍ, i. e. with twigs,]) put crosswise, and then
bound, or tied: (Az, TA:) or pieces of wood put
together like a حَظِيرَة, and then bound in the
middle with a cord, or rope, that joins them
together. (Lth, TA.) ―

or the like,] of a garment, or piece of cloth.

sewed the borders, or extremities, of a [cloth of
the kind called] لِبْد. (Ibn-' Abbád, TA.) ―
-b5-  A
streak, or line, (طَرِيقَةٌ,) in sand and the like;
as also ↓ حَبِيكَةٌ: pl. of the former حُبُكٌ; and of
the latter ↓ حَبَائِكٌ: (S:) or حُبُكً, the pl. of حِبَاكٌ,
signifies the ridges of sand [that are formed by
the wind]; (K;) the ripples (دَرَجَ) of sand, and
of water, when moved by the wind; pl. of حِبَاكٌ
and of ↓ حَبِيكَةٌ: (Az, TA:) [i. e.] حُبُكُ المَآءِ signifies المُتَكَسِّرُ مِنْهُ [the ripples of water]: and so
حُبُكُ الشَّعَرِ الجَعْدِ [the rimples, or wavy forms,
of crisp hair, appearing as though it were
crimped]: (K:) [and the like of other things:
this is what is meant by the following passage:]
Fr says, الحُبُكُ تَكَسُّرُ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ كَالرَّمْلِ إِذَا مَرَّتْ
بِهِ الرِّيحُ السَّاكِنَةُ وَ المَآءِ القَائِمِ إِذَا مَرَّتْ بِهِ الرِّيحُ
وَ دِرْعُ الحَدِيدِ لَهَا حُبُكٌ أَيْضًا وَ الشَّعْرَةُ الجَعْدَةُ تَكَسُّرُهَا
حُبُكٌ: (S:) [respecting the حُبُك of a coat of mail,
here mentioned, see what follows: in like manner,]
↓ حَبِيكٌ (T, K) and ↓ حَبَائِكُ and حُبُكٌ, all as pls.
of ↓ حَبِيكَةٌ, [or rather ↓ حَبِيكٌ is a coll. gen. n.,]
signify the streaks of locks of hair; (K;) or of
a helmet; (T, K; [in the CK, البَيْضَةُ is erroneously put for البَيْضَةِ;]) and likewise of sand,
such as are made by the wind: (T, TA:) the
حُبُك of the sky, (S, K,) sing. ↓ حَبِيكَةٌ, (K,) are
the tracks of the stars: (S, K:) and ↓ حَبَائِكٌ
signifies also streaks, or tracks, in the sky: and
the heavens; because in them are the paths of
the stars: and حُبُكٌ, the streaks of a mountain:
(TA:) and حُبُكُ دِرْعٍ, the rows of rings of a coat
of mail: (TK in art. حرشف:) [in a passage in
the S, cited above, it seems to be implied that it
means the rimples, or folds, thereof:] or the
scales of silver with which a coat of mail is ornamented; likened to the scales on the back of a
fish, by their being termed the حَرْشَفَ of a coat
of mail: (TA in art. حرشف:) and حِبَاكُ الحَمَامِ,
the blackness of the part above the wings of the
pigeon. (Ibn-'Abbád, A, K.) The phrase رَأْسُهُ
حُبُكٌ, in a description of Ed-Dejjál [or Antichrist], means The hair of his head is rimpled
(مُتَكَسِّرٌ) by reason of crispness; like stagnant
water, and sand, when the wind blows upon
them, and they in consequence thereof become
rippled (يَتَجَعَّدَانِ); and marked with streaks:

same: (TA:) or إِنَّ شَعَرَهُ حُبُكٌ حُبُكٌ: (S:) or
رَأْسُهُ حُبُكٌ حُبُكٌ. (TA.) In the phrase, in the
Kur [li. 7], وَ السَّمَآءِ ذَاتِ الحُبُكِ, it is said that
الحبك means the tracks of the stars, (S, Er-Rághib, TA,) and the milky way: or ideal
tracks: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or streaks of clouds:
(TA:) or beautiful طَرَائِق [which is generally
understood to mean, in this instance, streaks,
or the like; but may also be rendered stages, one
above another, to the number of seven]: (Zj,
TA:) or structures, or construction: (Mujáhid,
TA:) or beautiful construction. (I 'Ab, TA.)
