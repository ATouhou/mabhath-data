or the camels or the like,] became drawn, collected,

―
-b2-  See also 5, throughout; and see 7.
حَوْزٌ inf. n. of 1 [q. v.]. ―
-b2-  فِى حَوْزِهِ: see حَوْزَةٌ.
-A2-  A place of which a man takes possession,
(TA,) and around which a dam (مُسَنَّاةٌ) is made:
(K, TA:) pl. أَحْوَازٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  حَوْزُ الدَّارِ: see
حَيِّزٌ.
-A3-  لَيْلَةُ الحَوْزِ The first night during which
camels repair towards the water (As, S, K) when
it is distant from the pasture: (As, S:) because
they are driven gently that night: but when their
faces are turned towards the water and they are
left to pasture that night, the night is called
لَيْلَةُ الطَّلَقِ. (TA.) One says to a man, when he
holds back respecting an affair, دَعْنِى مِنْ حَوْزِكَ
وَطَلَقِكَ (assumed tropical:)  [Let me alone and cease from this and
that discursion of thine]. (TA.) And one says also,
طَوَّلَ عَلَيْنَا فُلَانٌ بِالْحَوْزِ وَالطَّلَقِ قَبْلَ القَرَبِ (assumed tropical:)  [Such
a one was prolix, or tedious, to us with this and
that discursion before coming to the point]. (TA.)
―
-b2-  حَوْزٌ is also used as an epithet; though properly an inf. n.: you say, سَوْقٌ حَوْزٌ [A gentle

below. (S, Msb, &c.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] (assumed tropical:)  A thing that
is in one's possession or occupation; a thing that
is one's property: so in the saying of a certain
woman, وَأَحْمِى حَوْزَةَ الغَائِبِ (assumed tropical:)  And I guard from
encroachment the property of the absent: meaning her فَرْج, which was the property of her
husband by the marriage-contract: whence it
appears that, if this saying be the only ground
upon which Az has asserted that one of the significations of حَوْزَةٌ is the فَرْج of a woman, [as is
also said in the K,] his assertion requires consideration; for a woman's فرج is her own when
she has no husband; and when she is married,
it is her husband's property. (L, TA.) You say
also, صَارَفِى حَوْزَتِهِ, and ↓ فِى حَوْزِهِ, [and ↓ فى حَيِّزِهِ,]
It became in his possession, or occupation. (L,
TA.) And فُلَانٌ مَانِعٌ حَوْزَتَهُ (assumed tropical:)  Such a one defends,
or guards, from encroachment, or invasion, or
attack, what is in his حَيِّز [or place; meaning,
in his possession or occupation]. (TA.) In like
manner, a poet says,
حَمَى حَوْزَاتِهِ فَتُرِكْنَ قَفْرًا
He guarded from encroachment his tracts of
pasture-land [so that they were left deserted].
(Fr, TA.) And it is said in a trad., فَحَمَى حَوْزَةً

guarded, from encroachment, or invasion, or
attack, the limits, [meaning, what the limits comprised, i. e., the territory,] and the tracts, or
regions, of El-Islám [meaning, of the Muslims].
(TA.) حَوْزَةُ المُلْكِ signifies [in like manner]
بَيْضَتُهُ [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  The seat of regal power: or the
heart, or principal part, of the kingdom]. (S, K.)
―
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  Nature; or natural disposition, temper, or
other quality or property; (K, TA;) whether
good or evil. (TA.)
حَيِّزٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb,) of the measure فَيْعِلٌ,
(Mgh, Msb,) from الحَوْزُ, (S, * Mgh,) as signifying “ the drawing, collecting, or gathering,
together,” (Mgh,) originally حَيْوِزٌ, (TA,) and

and هَيْنٌ, and لَيِّنٌ and لَيْنٌ; (S, TA;) [The
continent, or container, or receptacle, of anything; like بَيْضَةٌ; as also ↓ حَوْزَةٌ, q. v.:] any

by a thing having extent, as a body; or by a
thing not having extent, as an indivisible atom:

thing;] that in which the nature of a thing
requires it to be. (KT.) ―

region, or place, considered relatively, or as part
of a whole; or a part, or portion, of a place;
syn. نَاحِيَةٌ; (S, Mgh, Msb;) as also ↓ حَوْزَةٌ:
(S, Msb, K:) so the authors on practical law
mean by حَيِّزٌ; such, for instance, as a room,
or an apartment, of a house: (Mgh:) pl. أَحْيَازٌ,
(S, Msb, TA,) which is extr., (TA,) being from
the contracted form [حَيْزٌ]: (Msb:) by rule it
should be أَحْوَازٌ, (Az, Msb, TA,) like أَمْوَاتٌ, pl.
of مَيِّتٌ [and مَيْتٌ]: (Az, TA:) or by rule [if
from the uncontracted form حَيِّزٌ] it should be
حَيَائِزُ, with hemz, accord. to Sb; or حَيَاوِزُ, with
و, accord. to Abu-l-Hasan. (TA.) حَيِّزُ الدَّارِ,
(S, Msb, TA,) as also الدّارِ ↓ حَوْزُ, (TA,) signifies

conveniences thereof, such as the privy and the
kitchen and the like, and other parts or apartments;] such are termed collectively أَحْيَازُ الدَّارِ;
(Msb;) and each part or apartment (نَاحِيَة), by
itself, is termed حَيِّزٌ. (TA.) ―
-b3-  [Hence the saying,] أَنَا فِى حَيِّزِهِ وَكَنَفِهِ (tropical:)  [I am in his quarter
and protection]. (A, TA.) ―
-b4-  [And hence also
the saying,] فِى حَيِّزِ التَّوَاتِرُ (tropical:)  In the manner, and
place, of [that kind of transmission which is
termed] التواتر [which is “ transmission by such
a number of persons as cannot be supposed to
have agreed to a falsehood: ” as explained in the
Mz, 3rd نوع]. (Mgh.) ―
-b5-  And صَارَ فِى حَيِّزِهِ:

أَوْ مُتَحَيِّزًا إِلَى فِئَةٍ, in the Kur [viii. 16], signifies Or turning aside to a different company of
the Muslims: (Mgh, Msb: *) or the meaning is,
