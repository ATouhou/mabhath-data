حن1
حَنَّ, aor.
حَنِ3َ, inf. n. حَنِينٌ, He was, or became,
affected with [a yearning, longing, or desire, or]
an intense emotion of grief or of joy; as also
↓ استحنّ and ↓ تحانّ. (K.) [See an instance of
its denoting an emotion of joy voce حَنَّانٌ.] You
say, حَنَّ إِلَيْهِ, aor. and inf. n. as above, He, or
his soul, yearned towards, longed for, or desired,
him, or it. (S.) And حَنَّ إِلَى وَطَنِهِ He yearned
towards, longed for, or desired, his home. (TA.)
And تَحِنَّ إِلَى زَوْجِهَا الأَوَّلِ [She yearns towards
her first, or former, husband]. (TA.) And حَنَّتْ,
inf. n. as above, She (a woman) yearned towards,
longed for, or desired, her child, or children.
(Msb.) So, too, one says of a she-camel, meaning She yearned towards, longed for, or desired,
her home, or her young one; and in like manner,
of a pigeon: but in most instances it means she
(a camel) yearned with a cry, or uttered a cry
when yearning [or a yearning cry or the cry produced by yearning], towards her young one or her
companions: or she uttered a cry with emotion
after her young one: in its primary sense, she
reiterated her [yearning] cry after her young
one: but when you say, حَنَّ قَلْبِى إِلَيْهِ, you mean
My heart yearned towards, longed for, or desired,
him, or it, without the uttering of a cry or sound.
(TA.) They said also, لَاأَفْعَلُهُ حَتَّى يَحِنَّ الضَّبُّ
فِى أَثَرِ الإِبِلِ الصَّادِرَةِ [I will not do it until the
lizard called ضبّ yearn after the camels returning from the water; meaning I will never do
it]: this is only a prov.; for the ضبّ has no حَنِين
nor does it ever go to the water. (TA.) [And
حنَّ العُودُ, aor. and inf. n. as above, (assumed tropical:)  The lute
produced plaintive sounds: or excited lively
emotions of sadness, or of mirth: see حَنَّانٌ. And
in like manner one says of a musical reed: see
مُثَقَّب.] And حَنَّتِ القَوْسُ, (K,) aor. as above,
(S,) and so the inf. n., (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  The bow [twanged,
or] made a sound (K, TA) when its string had
been pulled and then let go. (S.) And حَنَّتِ
الطَّسْتُ إِذَا نُقِرَتْ (tropical:)  [The brazen basin rang when
it was knocked, or pecked]. (TA.) And حَنَّتِ
السَّارِيَةُ [The mast creaked, or made a creaking
sound]. (TA in art. صر.) And حَنَّ قِدْحُ لَيْسَ مِنْهَا
(assumed tropical:)  [An arrow of those used in the game called
المَيْسِر produced a sound: it was not of them]:
a prov., applied to a man who ascribes to himself
a false origin, or who arrogates to himself that to
which he has no relation: by the قدح is meant
one of the arrows of the ميسر; for when this
is not of the same substance as the others, and
is made to vibrate, it produces a sound different
from the sounds of the others, and is known
thereby. (TA. [See also Freytag's Arab. Prov.
i. 341.]) And حَنَّتِ الرِّيحُ and ↓ استحنّت (assumed tropical:)  [The
wind made a plaintive, or moaning, or perhaps
a shrill, sound; made a sound like the حَنِين of
camels: see حَنُونٌ]: both signify the same. (TA.)
[See also حَنِينٌ, below.] ―
-b2-  حَنَّ عَلَيْهِ, (S, Msb,
TA,) aor. as above, (S, Msb,) inf. n. حَنَانٌ (S,
Msb, K *) and حَنَّةٌ (Msb, TA *) and حَنٌّ, (K, *
TA,) He was merciful, compassionate, or pitiful,
towards him, or it; (S, Msb, K, * TA:) as also
↓ تحنّن: (S, K:) he was, or became, favourably
inclined towards him, or it; (Msb;) and so
↓ تحنّن: (TA:) he was, or became, affectionate,
or pitiful, or compassionate, towards him; (K, *
TA;) as also ↓ حَنْحَنَ. (IAar, Az, K.) And
عَلَى وَلَدِهَا ↓ تَحَنَّنَتْ She (a camel, and a ewe or
goat,) became favourably inclined, or compassionate, towards her young one. (Lh, TA.) ―
-b3-
See also 2. ―
-b4-  حَنَّ عَنِّى, aor.
حَنُ3َ, means صَدَّ; (S;)
i. e. He turned away from me, avoided me, or
shunned me: so that it is anomalous; for by rule
the aor. should be
حَنِ3َ; and it is not mentioned
among the exceptions [to the rule applying to
a case of this kind]. (MF, TA.) [But it appears
from what here follows that صَدَّ may perhaps
be here meant to be understood in its trans.
sense.]
-A2-  حَنَّهُ, (K,) [aor.
حَنُ3َ, as is shown below,]
inf. n. حَنٌّ, (TA,) signifies صَدَّهُ and صَرَفَهُ [He
turned him, or it, away, or back]. (K, TA.) You
say, حُنَّ عَنِّى شَرَّكَ, inf. n. حَنٌّ, Turn thou away,
or back, from me thy evil, or mischief. (K.) And
مَا تَحُنُّنِى شَيْئًا مِنْ شَرِّكَ Thou dost not turn away,

(S.)
-A3-  [حُنَّ, inf. n. حَنٌّ, app. He was, or became,
possessed by a demon, or by one of the tribe or
kind or class termed الحِنّ; and hence, he was,
or became, mad, or insane: for] حَنٌّ is syn. with
جُنُونٌ; (TA as from the K; [but not in the CK
nor in my MS. copy of the K;]) whence مَحْنُونٌ
applied to a man [as meaning مَجْنُونٌ]. (TA.)
2
حَنَّ3َ [حنّنهُ عَلَى غَيْرِهِ, accord. to modern usage,
and perhaps classical also, He, or it, caused him
to be merciful, compassionate, pitiful, or favourably inclined, towards another.]
-A2-  حَمَلَ فَحَنَّنَ
He charged, or made an assault or attack, and
was cowardly, and retreated. (K, TA.) ―
-b2-  مَا
حَنَّنَ عَنِّى He did not turn away from me; did
not leave, or relinquish, me. (TA.) [And ↓ احنّ,
or ↓ حَنَّ, seems to have a similar meaning: for]
you say, أَثَرٌ لَا يُحِنُّ عَنِ الجِلْدِ A mark that does
not go away from the skin: or, accord. to Th,
who does not explain it, it is يَحِنُّ. (TA.)
-A3-

(K:) and in like manner one says of a herb.

that were before Adam; (TA;) of which are
black dogs: (K:) or the lowest, or meanest, sort

(IAar, K:) or the dogs thereof: (Fr, TA:) or

حَنَّةٌ: see حَنَانٌ. ―
-b2-  It is said in a prov., لَا
تَعْدَمُ نَاقَةٌ مِنْ أُمِّهَا حَنَّةً, and ↓ حَنِينًا, meaning
[The she-camel will not be without] likeness [to
her mother]: and one says of a man who resembles
another man, and of any one who resembles his
father and his mother, لَا تَعْدَمُ أَدْمَآءُ مِنْ أُمِّهَا حَنَّةً
[A female camel of the colour termed أُدْمَة (i. e.
white, or very white, &c.,) will not be without
likeness to her mother]. (TA. [See also Freytag's
Arab. Prov. ii. 497.]) ―

as also ↓ حَنَّةٌ: (K:) so in the phrase, بِهِ حِنَّةٌ [In
him is demoniacal possession, or madness, or insanity: see الحِنُّ]. (S.)
حَنَانٌ Mercy, compassion, or pity: (S, K:)
tenderness of heart; (K;) which is the same;
(TA;) as also ↓ حِنَّةٌ, with kesr; (Kr, TA;) for
which the vulgar say ↓ حَنِّيِّةٌ: (TA:) and ↓ حَنَّةٌ
[in like manner] signifies affection, and compassion. (Az, TA.) وَحَنَانًا مِنْ لَدُنَّا, in the Kur
[xix. 14], respecting which I 'Ab is related by
'Ikrimeh to have said, I know not what is الحَنَانُ,
means And mercy from us. (S, TA.) The Arabs
say, حَنَانَكَ يَا رَبِّ and حَنَانَيْكَ [I beg thy mercy,
O my Lord]: both signify the same; i. e. رَحْمَتَكَ:
(S:) the latter is the expression commonly used:
(A 'Obeyd, in a marginal note in a copy of the
S:) or [rather] the latter means have mercy on
me time after time, and with mercy after mercy:
(K, * TA:) it is a dualized inf. n., of which the
verb is not expressed; like لَبَّيْكَ and سَعْدَيْكَ: (TA:)
or it means [let thy mercy be continuous to me;]
whenever I receive mercy and good from Thee,
let it not cease, but be conjoined with other mercy
from Thee: (ISd, TA:) the dual form is not
to be understood as restricting the signification to
duality: (Suh, TA:) the word is not used in this
form otherwise than as a prefixed noun: (Sb,
TA:) but sometimes they said حَنًانًا, in the sing.,
without prefixing it. (ISd, TA.) They said also,
سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ وَحَنَانَيْهِ meaning [I extol, or celebrate,
or declare, the absolute purity, or perfection, or
glory, of God,] and I beg his mercy; like as they
said, سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ وَرَيْحَانَهُ. (TA.) And حَنَانَ اللّٰهِ
as meaning مَعَاذَ اللّٰهِ [I seek the protection, or
preservation, of God]. (K.) ―
-b2-  Also i. q. رِزْقٌ
[Means of subsistence, &c.]: and بَرَكَةٌ [a blessing; any good that is bestowed by God; prosperity, or good fortune; increase; &c.]. (K.)
―
-b3-  A quality inspiring reverence or veneration
or respect or honour: (El-Umawee, K:) gravity,
staidness, or sedateness. (K.) One says, مَاتَرَى
لَهُ حَنَانًا Thou seest him not to possess any quality
inspiring reverence &c. (El-Umawee, TA.)
-A2-
Evil, or mischief, long continuing. (K.)
حَنُونٌ A wind (رِيح) [that makes a plaintive,
or moaning, or perhaps a shrill, sound;] that
makes a sound like the حَنِين of camels. (S, K,
TA.) ―
-b2-  A woman who marries from a motive of
tenderness, or compassion, for her children, (K,
TA,) when they are young, (TA,) in order that
the husband may maintain them. (K, TA.)
حَنِينٌ an inf. n. of 1: (S, Msb, K:) A yearning,
longing, or desire; (S, K;) a yearning, or longing, of the soul: (S:) or the expression of pain
arising from yearning or longing or desire: (Ham
p. 538:) violence of weeping: and a lively emotion:
or the sound produced by such emotion, proceeding
from grief, or from joy: (K:) or a sound proceeding from the bosom on the occasion of weeping:
خَنِينٌ is from the nose: (TA:) or the former is
[a sound] without weeping and without tears:
if with weeping, it is termed خَنِينٌ: (R, TA:)
or the former is a yearning, or longing, or desire,
with affection, or pity, or compassion; as when
one speaks of the حنين of a woman and of a she-camel for her young one: and sometimes this is
accompanied with a sound, or cry; wherefore it
is explained as a sound, or cry, indicating yearning or longing or desire, and affection or pity or
compassion: and sometimes it is confined to the
form; as in the case of the حنين [or leaning, or
inclining,] of the trunk of a palm-tree [which
is mentioned in a trad.]: (Er-Rághib:) the حنين
of the she-camel is ber cry in her yearning
towards her young one: (S:) or her yearning
towards her young one with a cry, and without
a cry; (Lth, TA;) mostly the former: originally,
her reiterating her [yearning] cry after her young
one. (TA.) You say also, رِيحٌ لَهَا حَنِينٌ كَحَنِينِ
الإِبِلِ (assumed tropical:)  [A wind that has a plaintive, or moaning,
or perhaps a shrill, sound, like the حنين of camels].
