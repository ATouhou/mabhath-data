لَا حَرْفَ لَهُ, in the S and K in art. جزم, a writingreed not having a nib obliquely cut. (TA in that
art. [See 2 in the present art.]) And حَرْفَا الرَّأْسِ

religion, in a fluctuating state, like him who is in

or suspense, (Zj, K, Jel,) being unsteady like him
who alights and abides upon the حَرْف [i. e. point,

state of disquietude respecting his case; (Ibn-
'Arafeh, K;) i. e. not entering into the religion
firmly, or steadily: (K:) or who serves God in
one mode of circumstances; i. e. when in ample
circumstances, and not when straitened in circumstances; (Az, S, K;) as though good fortune and
plenty were one side, and an evil state were another
side: (Az, TA:) [hence,] حَرْفٌ sometimes signifies a mode, or manner, and a way. (Msb.) ―
-b2-

K:) the letters being thus called because they are

بِحَرْفٍ مُفْهِمٍ [Prayer is made null by a significant letter] means only by an imperative of a

been revealed according to seven dialects, of the
dialects of the Arabs: (A'Obeyd, Az, IAth,
K:) or this means, according to seven modes,
or manners, (Mgh, Msb,) of reading: whence
فُلَانٌ يَقْرَأُ بِحَرْفِ ابْنِ مَسْعُودٍ Such a one reads
in the manner of reading of Ibn-Mes'ood.
(Mgh.)
-A2-  Applied to a she-camel, (assumed tropical:)  Lean, or

thinness, and her sharpness and effectiveness in
pace; (Z, TA;) or to a letter of the alphabet,
meaning the letter ا, in respect of her leanness:
(TA:) or excellent, or high-bred, or strong and
light and swift, sharp and effective in pace, rendered lean by journeyings; likened to the حرف

Dhu-r-Rummeh's description of a she-camel by
the epithets جُمَالِيَّةٌ حَرْفٌ سِنَادٌ: (TA:) [see حَرِيثَةٌ:]
or [in the CK “ and ”] great; big; of great size;
(K, TA;) likened to the حرف of a mountain:
(TA:) it is applied only to a she-camel: one may
not say جَمَلٌ حَرْفٌ. (IAar, TA.)

[as inf. n. of حُرِمَ]: (K, TA:) lack of good fortune,

property: (S:) debarment from the means of
subsistence. (Mgh.) Hence the saying of 'Omar,
أَحَدِهِمْ أَشَدُّ عَلَىَّ مِنْ عَيْلَتِهِ ↓ لِحِرْفَةُ, (S, K,) or,
accord. to one reading, ↓ لَحُرْفَةُ, (TA,) [Verily
the ill-fatedness of any one of them is more distressing to me than his poverty:] i. e., the supplying the wants of the poor man is easier to me
than the making the bad to thrive: or the meaning
is, the want of the means of gaining subsistence by
any one of them, and grief on that account, is
more distressing to me than his poverty: so in the
Nh. (TA.)
-A2-  الحُرْفُ A certain grain, resembling
