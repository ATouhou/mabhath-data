حسب1
حَسَبَهُ, (S, A, Mgh, &c.,) aor.
حَسُبَ, (S, Mgh,
Msb, &c.,) inf. n. حَسْبٌ (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K)
and حُسْبَانٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and حِسْبَانٌ (K)
and حِسَابٌ (S, K,) which is generally an inf. n.
of this verb, but sometimes of حَاسَبَ, (TA,) and
حِسَابَةٌ (S, K) and حِسْبَةٌ, (Msb, K,) or this is like
قِعْدَةٌ and رِكْبَةٌ, [denoting a mode, or manner,]
as in a verse of En-Nábighah cited below, (S,)
and حَسْبَةٌ, which is of rare occurrence, (MF,
TA,) He numbered, counted, reckoned, calculated, or computed, it; (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K;)
namely, property [&c.]. (A, Mgh, Msb.) You
say, مَنْ يَقْدِرُ عَلَى عَدِّ الرَّمْلِ وَحَسْبِ الحَصَى
[Who can count the sands, and number the pebbles?]. (A.) And أَلْقِ هٰذَا فِى الحَسْبِ [Throw thou
this into the reckoning]; i. e., into what thou hast
reckoned. (A.) وَالشَّمْسُ وَالقَمَرُ بِحُسْبَانٍ, in the
Kur [lv. 4], means And the sun and the moon [run
their courses] according to a [certain] reckoning;
or through a series of mansions [or constellations],
the bounds of which they do not transgress:
(TA:) or بحسبان alludes to the numbers of the
months and years and all other times: [but properly speaking,] حسبان is here an inf. n.: (Zj,
TA:) or, accord. to Akh, a pl. of حِسَابٌ; (S,
TA;) and so says AHeyth: or, accord. to some,
it is here a proper subst., signifying the firmament. (TA.) حُسْبَانًا in the Kur vi. 96 is held by
Akh to be for بِحُسْبَانٍ, meaning بِحِسَابٍ [as in
the phrase quoted above, from the Kur lv. 4,
accord. to the first explanation]. (TA.) And
حُسْبَانُكَ عَلَى اللّٰه signifies حِسَابُكَ على اللّٰه [On
God be it to reckon with thee: see also حَسِيبُكَ
اللّٰهُ]. (TA.) Az says that the reckoning in buying
and selling is termed حِسَابٌ because one knows
thereby what is sufficient. (TA.) وَاللّٰهُ سَرِيعُ
الحِسَابِ, in the Kur [ii. 198, &c., God is quick
in reckoning], signifies that his reckoning is necessary, or of necessity, and that his reckoning
with one person does not divert Him from reckoning with another. (TA.) And يَرْزُقُ مَنْ يَشَآءُ بَغَيْرِ
حِسَابٍ, in the Kur [ii. 208, &c., He supplieth
whom He willeth, without reckoning], means
without sparing, or scanting; as when a man
expends without reckoning: but the phrase is
variously explained, as meaning without appointing for any one what is deficient: or without
fearing that any one will call Him to account
for it: or without the receiver's thinking that
He will bestow upon him, or without his reckoning
upon the supply; so that it may be from حَسِبَ
“ he thought,” or from حَسَبَ “ he reckoned. ”
(L, TA.) The saying, cited by IAar,
يَا جُمْلُ أَسْقَاكِ بِلَا حِسَابَهْ
as related by J [in the S], but correctly أُسْقيت,
(TA,) means [O Juml, mayest thou be given rain]
without reckoning, and without measure. (S.)
An instance of حِسْبَةٌ as similar to قِعْدَةٌ and رِكْبَةٌ
occurs in the saying of En-Nábighah,
فَكَمَّلَتْ مِائَةً فِيهَا حَمَامَتُهَا
وَأَسْرَعَتْ حسْبَةً فِى ذٰلِكَ العَدَدٍ
[And she completed a hundred, in which was her
pigeon; and she was quick in the mode of computing that number]. (S.)
-A2-  حَسِبَهُ كَذَا, [a verb
of the kind termed أَفْعَالُ القُلُوبِ, having two
objective complements, the former of which is
called its noun, and the latter its enunciative,]
aor.
حَسَبَ and
حَسِبَ; (S, Msb, K;) the former the more
approved, (TA,) of the dialects of all the Arabs
except Benoo-Kináneh; the latter aor. being
peculiar to the dial. of this tribe, (Msb,) and
contr. to analogy, (S, Msb,) for by rule it should
be
حَسَبَ [only]; and حَسِبَ is the only verb of the
measure فَعِلَ having both يَفْعَلُ and يَفْعِلُ as the
measures of its aor. except نَعِمَ and يَئِسَ and يَبِسَ
[and وَعِرَ and وَحِرَ and بَئِسَ and وَلِهَ and وَهِلَ
mentioned by Ibn-Málik (with the preceding)
cited in the TA voce وَرِثَ]; but eight verbs
having an unsound letter for the first radical have
kesreh to the medial radical in the pret. and aor.,
viz., وَثِقَ and وَرِثَ and وَرِعَ and وَرِمَ and وَرِيَ and
وَفِقَ and وَلِىَ and وَمِقَ; (S;) inf. n. حِسْبَانٌ (S,
Mgh, Msb, K) and مَحْسَبَةٌ and مَحْسِبَةٌ (S, K)
and حِسَابٌ; (TA; [but see what follows;]) He
[counted, accounted, reckoned, or esteemed, meaning] thought, or supposed, him, or it, to be so.
(S, Mgh, Msb, K.) You say, حَسِبْتُهُ صَالِحًا [I
counted him, or thought him, good, or righteous].
(S.) And حَسِبْتُ زَيْدًا قَائِمًا [I thought Zeyd to
be standing]. (Msb.) And مَا كَانَ فِى حِسْبَانِى
كَذَا [Such a thing was not in my thought]: you
should not say فى حِسَابِى, (K,) unless you mean
thereby it was not included in my reckoning, or,
by amplification of the sense, I did not think it.
(MF.)
-A3-  حَسُبَ, aor.
حَسُبَ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. حَسَابَةٌ
(S, K) and حَسَبٌ, (Msb, K,) He was, or became,
characterized, or distinguished, by what is termed
حَسَبٌ as explained below [i. e. grounds of pretension to respect or honour; &c.]. (S, Msb, K.)
2
حسّبهُ, inf. n. تَحْسِيبٌ: see 4. ―
-b2-  Also He
placed a pillow for him; supported him with a
pillow; (S, K;) seated him upon a حُسْبَانَة, or
مَحْسَبَة. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And hence, He honoured him.
(L.) ―
-b4-  He buried him: (TA:) or buried him
in stones: [see حَسْبٌ:] or buried him wrapped
in grave-clothing: namely, a dead person. (K,
TA.) ―
-b5-  Nuheyk El-Fezáree says, (S, TA,) addressing 'Ámir Ibn-Et-Tufeyl, (TA,)
لَتَقَيْتَ بِالوَجْعَآءِ طَعْنَةَ مُرْهَفٍ
↓ حَرَّانَ أَوْ لَثَوَيْتَ غَيْرَ مُحَسَّبِ
(S, TA) Thou wouldst have avoided, by turning
thy hinder part, the thrust [of a thin, thirsty
weapon], or thou wouldst have taken thy restingplace (TA) not honoured, or not shrouded, (S,
TA,) or not pillowed: غير محسّب being variously
rendered: one person prefers the meaning not
buried: Az says that the signification of burial in
stones and that of wrapping in grave-clothes,
assigned to the verb, were unknown to him; and
that غير محسّب signifies not supported with a
pillow. (TA.)
3
حاسبهُ, inf. n. مُحَاسَبَةٌ (S, TA) and sometimes حِسَابٌ, which is also an inf. n. of حَسَبَ, or,
accord. to Th, it seems to be a quasi-inf. n., (TA,)
[He reckoned with him.] And حاسبهُ عَلَيْهِ [He
called him to account for it]. (TA.)
4
احسبهُ, (Th, S, K,) inf. n. إِحْسَابٌ, (TA,)
He gave him what sufficed, or satisfied, him,
مِنْ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ of everything: (Th, TA:) he contented him: (K:) or he gave him what contented
him; as also ↓ حسّبهُ: (S:) and both verbs, inf. n.
of the latter تَحْسِيبٌ, he gave him to eat and
drink until he was satisfied: (K:) and the former,
[or both,] he gave him until he said حَسْبِى [It is
sufficient for me]. (AZ, S.) You say also, أَعْطَى
فَأَحْسَبَ He gave, and (assumed tropical:)  gave much: (S:) and
↓ اِحْتَسَبْتُهُ, [if not a mistranscription for أَحْسَبْتُهُ,]
(tropical:)  I gave him much. (A, TA.) ―
-b2-  Also It (a
thing, S, Msb,) sufficed him: (S, A, Msb:) he
sufficed him. (TA.) You say, مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ أَحْسَبَكَ
مِنْ رَجُلٍ, and [مِنْ رَجُلَيْنِ] بِرَجُلَيْنِ أَحْسَبَاكَ, and
[مِنْ رِجَالٍ] بِرِجَالٍ أَحْسَبُوكَ, I passed by a man
sufficient for thee as a man, i. e., supplying to
thee the place of any other [by his excellent qualities], and by two men &c., and by men &c. (S.)
[The verb here is rendered, in grammatical analysis, by its act. part. n. See also حَسْبُ.]
5
تحسَب (tropical:)  He sought, or sought leisurely and
repeatedly, to learn news: (A, K, * TA:) he sought
after news: (K, * TA:) he inquired, or asked, respecting news; (S, K, * TA; [in the CK, اسْتَخْيَرَ
is erroneously put for اِسْتَخْبَرَ;]) of the dial. of
El-Hijáz: (TA:) he searched after news as a
spy. (A 'Obeyd, TA.) It is said in a trad.,
accord. to one reading, كَانُوا يَجْتَمِعُونَ فَيَتَحَسَّبُونَ
الصَّلَاةَ (tropical:)  They used to assemble, and endeavour to
ascertain the time of prayer: but the common
reading is يَتَحَيَّنُونَ. (TA.)
-A2-  Also He reclined
upon a pillow. (K.)
8
احتسب [for احتسب أَجْرًا He reckoned upon
a reward: or] he sought a reward [from God in
the world to come]. (TA.) وَيَرْزُقُهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ
لَا يَحْتَسِبُ, in the Kur lxv. 2, means [And He will
supply him with the means of subsistence] whence
he does not reckon, or expect; whence does not
occur to his mind. (Bd, Jel.) And مَنْ صَامَ
رَمَضانَ إِيمَانًا وَاحْتِسَابًا, in a trad., Whoso fasteth
during Ramadán, believing in God and his
Apostle, and [reckoning upon a reward, or] seeking a reward from God. (Mgh, * TA.) You
say also, احتسب بِكَذَا أَجْرًا عِنْدَ اللّٰهِ (S, K) He
reckoned upon obtaining, [or he sought,] by such
a thing, or such an action, a reward from God:
(PS:) or he prepared, or provided, such a thing,
seeking thereby a reward from God. (K.) And
احتسب عِنْدَ اللّٰهِ خَيْرًا He prepared, or provided,
in store for himself, good, [i. e. a reward,] with
God. (A, Mgh.) And احتسب الأَجْرَ عَلَى اللّٰهِ
He laid up for himself, in store, the reward,
with God, not hoping for the reward of the
present life; اِحْتِسَابُ الأَجْرِ relating only to an
action done for the sake of God. (Msb.) [Hence,]
احتسب وَلَدَهُ, (A, Mgh,) or ابْنَهُ, (Msb,) or ابْنًا,
or بنْتًا, (S, K, *) is said when one has lost by
death an adult child or son or daughter; (S, A,
Mgh, Msb, K;) meaning He prepared, or provided, in store for himself, a reward, by his
patience on the occasion of his being afflicted and
tried by the death of his adult child: (Mgh, *
TA:) when a man has lost by death a child not
arrived at the age of puberty, you say of him,
اِفْتَرَطَهُ. (S, A, Msb, K.) [Hence also,] احتسب
عَمَلَهُ [He reckoned upon, or prepared for himself, a reward by his deed: or] he did his deed
seeking a reward from God in the world to come.
(L, TA.) ―
-b2-  اِحْتَسَبْتُ بَالشَّىْءِ I included the thing
in a numbering, or reckoning; or made account
of it; accounted it a matter of importance.
(Msb.) And فُلَانٌ لَا يُحْتَسَبُ [for لا يحتسب بَهِ]
Such a one is made no account of; is not esteemed,
or regarded, as of any account, or importance.
(A, TA.) ―
-b3-  اِحْتَسَبْتُ عِنْدَهُ means اِكْتَفَيْتُ [I
was, or became, sufficed, or contented, thereat, or
with him, or at his abode]. (A, TA.) [And
IbrD thinks that the verb has the same signification in the phrase اِحْتَسَبْتُ عَلَيْهِ بِالمَالِ, quoted in
the TA from the A; holding عليه to be here
used in the sense of عَنْهُ; so that the meaning is
I was, or became, sufficed, so as to have no need
of him, or it, by the property: but I doubt
whether this phrase be correctly transcribed.] ―
-b4-
احتسب also signifies اِنْتَهَى [He abstained, or
desisted; app. as one sufficed, or contented].
(K.) ―
-b5-  And احتسب عَلَيْهِ كَذَا He disapproved
and disallowed his doing, or having done, such a
thing; (S, K; *) namely, a foul deed: (TA:)
whence the appellation ↓ مُحْتَسِبٌ. (K.) And
accord. to some, احتسب اللّٰهَ عَلَيْهِ means He said,
May God take, or execute, vengeance upon him;
or punish him; for his evil deeds. (Har p. 371.
[See حَسِيبٌ.]) [In the present day, احتسب عَلَيْهِ
is used as meaning He prayed for aid against
him by saying, حَسْبُنَا اللّٰهُ God is, or will be,
sufficient for us.] ―
-b6-  You say also, احتسب فُلَانًا,
(K,) or احتسب مَا عِنْدَهُ, (A,) meaning (tropical:)  He
endeavoured to learn what such a one had [in his
mind, or in his possession]. (A, K, * TA.) ―
-b7-
See also 4.

احسبّ He (a camel) was, or became, of a
white colour intermixed with red (S, TA) and
with black. (TA.)
حَسْبٌ Sufficiency. (K voce هَسْبٌ.) ―
-b2-  حَسْبُ
is a [prefixed] noun (S) [syn. with كَفْىُ, as is
implied in the K voce قَطْ; or] syn. with كَافِى;
(Msb;) or [virtually] meaning كَفَى [as a pret.
in the sense of an emphatic aor.]; (S, K;) or
يَكْفِى: (TA:) Sb says that it is used to denote
the being sufficed, or content. (TA.) You say,
حَسْبُكَ دِرْهَمٌ [and بِحَسْبِكَ دِرْهَمٌ, in which latter
the ب is redundant; meaning Thy sufficiency, or
a thing sufficing thee, is a dirhem; a phrase
which may be used in two ways; as predicating
of what is sufficient, that it is a dirhem; and as
predicating of a dirhem, that it is sufficient; in
which latter case, بحسبك is an enunciative put
before its inchoative, (as also حَسْبُكَ,) so that the
meaning is, a dirhem is a thing sufficing thee,
i. e. a dirhem is sufficient for thee; as is shown
in a marginal note in my copy of the Mughnee,
in art. بِ; or, accord. to the S and K, a dirhem
suffices thee: accord. to Bd (iii. 167), بحسبك
means مُحْسِبُكَ, and كَافِيكَ, from أَحْسَبَهُ meaning
كَفَاهُ; and is shown to have this meaning by its
not importing a determinate signification in consequence of its being a prefixed noun with its
complement in the saying, هٰذَا رَجُلٌ حَسْبُكَ This
is a man sufficing thee]. (S, Msb, K.) You say
also, حَسْبُكَ ذٰلِكَ That is, or will be, [or let that
be,] sufficient for thee. (TA.) And حَسْبُكَ اللّٰهُ,
in the Kur viii. 65, God is, or will be, sufficient
for thee. (Fr, TA. See also حَسِيبُكَ اللّٰهُ.) And
حَسْبُكَ بِصَدِيقِنَا [A person sufficing thee is our
friend]; in which the ب is added to denote
emphatic praise. (Fr, TA in art. بِ.) In the
saying, هٰذَا رَجُلٌ حَسْبُكَ مِنْ رَجُلٍ This is a man
sufficing thee as a man, i. e. supplying to thee the
place of any other [by his excellent qualities],
(S, K,) and مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ حَسْبِكَ مِنْ رَجُلٍ I passed
by a man sufficing thee as a man, (TA,) حسبك
is an expression of praise, referring to the indeterminate noun [رجل]; because, in its case, [what is
originally (see below)] an inf. n. (فِعْلٌ [under
which term lexicologists, but not grammarians,
include the مَصْدَر]) is rendered, in grammatical
analysis, by another word, [i. e., by an act.
part. n.,] as though one said مُحْسِبٌ لَكَ, or كَافٍ
لَكَ. (S. [Thus حسبك in these two instances is
a صِفَة, i. e. an epithetic phrase; and من رجل
is a تَمْيِيز, i. e. a specificative phrase.]) When
the noun to which حسبك refers is determinate,
you put حسب in the accus. case, as a حال, i. e.
a denotative of state; as in the saying, هٰذَا عَبْدُ
اللّٰهِ حَسْبَكَ مِنْ رَجُلٍ This is 'Abd-Allah; being
one sufficing thee as a man. (S. [Here من رجل
is, as before, a specificative phrase.]) [See also
4, the corresponding verb.]) حسب, in this
manner, is used alike as sing. and dual and pl.;
(S, K;) being [originally] an inf. n. (S.) It is
also used alone, [as a prefixed noun of which the
complement is understood,] as in the phrase
زَيْدٌ حَسْبُ, without tenween, for حَسْبِى or حَسْبُكَ
[&c., meaning Zeyd is sufficient for me or for
thee &c.]; like as one says, جَآءَنِى زَيْدٌ لَيْسَ غَيْرُ,
for لَيْسَ غَيْرُهُ عِنْدِى. (S. [That is, حَسْبُ, when
thus used, is subject to the same rules as غَيْرُ and
قَبْلُ, and بَعْدُ &c. when so used.]) ―
-b3-  See also
حَسَبٌ, in three places.
-A2-  Also, (TA,) and ↓ حِسْبَةٌ,
(K,) Burial of the dead: (TA:) or burial of the
dead in stones [app. meaning in a grave cased
with stones]: or burial of the dead wrapped in
grave-clothes: like تَحْسِيبٌ. (K. [See 2.])
حَسَبٌ i. q. ↓ مَحْسُوبٌ; (S, K;) of the measure
فَعَلٌ in the sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ, like نَفَضٌ
in the sense of مَنْفُوضٌ; (S;) Numbered, counted,
reckoned, calculated, or computed. (S, K.) ―
-b2-
A number counted. (L.) ―
-b3-  Amount, quantity,
or value. (L.) Sometimes, (S, L, K,) by poetic
license, (S,) and in prose, (L,) ↓ حَسْبٌ. (S, L,
K.) You say, الأَجْرُ بِحَسَبِ مَا عَمِلْتَ, and
↓ بِحَسْبِ, The recompense is, or shall be, according to the amount, or quantity, or value, of thy
work. (L.) And يُجْزَى المَرْءُ عَلَى حَسَبِ عَمَلِهِ
The man is, or shall be, paid according to the
amount, or quantity, of his work. (Msb.) And
عَلَى حَسَبِ مَا أَسْدَيْتَ إِلَىَّ شُكْرِى لَكَ [and ↓ حَسْبَمَا
(for عَلَى حَسَبِ مَا)] According to the amount, or
value, of the benefit, or benefits, that thou hast
conferred upon me are my thanks to thee. (L.)
And لِيَكُنْ عَمَلُكَ بِحَسَبِ ذٰلِكَ Let thy deed, or
work, be correspondent to the quantity, or number,
of that: or adequate, or equivalent, to that. (S.)
And هٰذَا بِحَسَبِ ذَا This is equal in number or
quantity, or is equivalent, to that. (K.) And
مَا أَدْرِى مَا حَسَبُ حَدِيثِكَ, i. e. ما قَدْرُهُ [app. I
know not what is the value of thy story]. (Ks, S.)
And أَحْسَنْتُ إِلَيْهِ حَسَبَ الطَّاقَةِ and عَلَى حَسَبِ
الطَّاقَةِ I benefited him according to the measure
of ability. (Mgh.) ―
-b4-  Also [Grounds of pretension to respect or honour, consisting in any
qualities (either of oneself or of one's ancestors)
which are enumerated, or recounted, as causes
of glorying: and hence signifying nobility; rank
or quality; honourableness, or estimableness, from
whatever source derived:] originally, (MF,) what
one enumerates, or recounts, of the deeds, or
qualities, in which his ancestors have gloried:
(S, A, Mgh, * K, MF:) secondly, what one enumerates, or recounts, of his own deeds, or qualities,
in which he glories: thirdly, what one enumerates,
or recounts, of any deeds, or qualities, that are
causes of his glorying, of whatever kind they be:
(MF:) or the memorable deeds, or qualities, of
one's ancestors; and one's own deeds, or qualities,

nor مَجْدٌ. (S, Msb, * K.) حَسَبٌ is also used
elliptically, (Mgh, TA,) [in the sense of حَسِيبٌ,
q. v.,] for ذُو حَسَبٍ, (TA,) and for ذَوُو حَسَبٍ.
(Mgh.) ―
-b5-  اِشْتَرَى بِالحَسَبِ He bought a thing
in an honourable manner with respect to himself
and the seller: حسب, here, is said to be from
حَسَّبَهُ “ he honoured him; ” or from حُسْبَانَةٌ “ a
small pillow ” [because him for whom you put a
pillow you honour: see 2]. (TA.)
