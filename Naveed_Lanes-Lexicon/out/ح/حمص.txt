حمصحِمَّصٌ and حِمٍّصٌ; (S, Msb, K;) the former
preferred by Th, (S, TA,) and by the Koofees,
(Msb, TA,) and the only word of that form except قِنَّفٌ and قلَّفٌ and قِنِّبٌ and خِنَّبٌ; (Fr,
TA;) the latter alone allowed by Mbr, (S,) and
this alone mentioned by Sb, (TA,) and preferred
by the Basrees, (Msb, TA,) and said by Mbr to
be the only word of this form except حِلِّزٌ, meaning “ short,” and جِلِّقٌ, the name of a place in
Syria, (S, TA,) but IAar did not know this latter
form of the word; (Az, TA;) [The cicer arietinum; or chick-peas;] a certain grain, (S, Msb,
K,) well known, (Msb, K,) of the description
termed القَطَانِ: (AHn:) n. un. حِمَّصَةٌ and
حِمِّصَةٌ: (TA:) it is white, and red, and black,
and of a sort called كِرْسِنِىٌّ [or كَرْسَنِىٌّ?]; and
is also wild, and cultivated in gardens: the wild
sort is the hotter, and the more contracted; the
nutriment of the garden-sort is the better; and
the black is the most powerful in its operations:
(the Minháj, TA:) it is flatulent, lenitive, diuretic,
having the property of increasing the seminal
fluid and the carnal appetite and the blood:
(K:) Hippocrates says that it has in it two substances, which quit it by cooking; one of them
salt, or saline, which is lenitive; and the other
sweet, which is diuretic; and it clears away spots
in the skin, and beautifies the complexion, and is
beneficial for hot tumours, and its oil is serviceable for the ringworm, or tetter; and its meal,
for the fluid of foul ulcers; and the infusion
thereof, for toothache, and for swelling of the lip;
and it clears the voice: (TA:) it also strengthens
the body and the penis; (K;) wherefore it is
given as fodder to the stallions of horses and the
like, and of camels; (TA;) on the condition of
its being eaten not before [other] food nor after
it, but in the midst thereof; (K;) or, correctly,
as in the Minháj, it should be eaten between two
meals. (TA.)
