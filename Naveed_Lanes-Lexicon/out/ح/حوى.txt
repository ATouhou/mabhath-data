drawing together, or contracting: and the state
of drawing together, or contracting; or being

the pl. is حَوَايَا; (K;) or this is the pl. of حَوِيَّةٌ,
signifying the أَمْعَآء [or intestines into which the
food passes from the stomach]; and the pl. of
حَاوِيَةٌ and حَاوِيَآءُ is [said to be] حَوَاوٍ; (S;) but
IB says that this latter pl. is not held to be allowable by Sb, and that حَوَايَا is the pl. of all the
three sings., [originally] of the measure فَعَائِلُ as
pl. of the first, and فَوَاعِلُ as pl. of the second and
third [though in these two cases it should be by
rule حَوَآءٍ]: AHeyth says that حَوَايَا as pl. of
حَاوِيَةٌ is like زَوَايَا as pl. of زَاوِيَةٌ: and ISk mentions الحَاوِيَاتُ as pl. of الحَاوِيَةُ and الحَاوِيَآءُ, [in
the latter case like قَاصِعَاتٌ as pl. of قَاصِعَآءُ,] and
explains it as signifying بَنَاتُ اللَّبَنِ [app. meaning
the small guts, or intestines, in which originate
the lacteals]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also sing. of حَوَايَا signifying Winding excavations or hollows, which
the rain fills, and in which it remains a long time
because the soil at the bottom thereof is cohesive
and hard, retaining the water: the Arabs call
them [also] أَمْعَآء, likening them to the حَوَايَا of
the belly: accord. to AA, the pl. signifies i. q.
مَسَاطِحُ [pl. of مِسْطَحٌ], made by collecting earth
and stones upon smooth and hard rock, to confine
thereby water: accord. to IB, on the authority
of IKh, wells that are dug in the district of Kelb,
in hard ground, whereby is confined the water of
the torrents, which they drink throughout the
year: accord. to Nasr, a certain construction
with masses of rock in the form of a pool, on the
way to Et-Teghlibeeyeh, near Ood: accord. to
ISd, the sing. signifies a smooth and hard rock
which is surrounded with stones and earth, in
which water collects. (TA.) ―

is only for camels, and the latter is sometimes for
other animals: pl. حَوَايَا: (S:) a subst. from 2
in the last of the senses assigned to it above:
(IAth:) [the same is app. meant by what here
follows:] a certain thing that is prepared for a
woman to ride upon. (TA. [But it was also
used by men.]) 'Omeyr Ibn-Wahb El-Jumahee
said, on the day of Bedr, when he computed the
number of the companions of the Prophet, رَأَيْتُ
الحَوَايَا عَلَيْهَا المَنَايَا [meaning I saw the حوايا with
the men of courage upon them]: (S:) [for]
مَنِيَّةٌ [sing. of منايا] means (assumed tropical:)  “ a man of courage
upon his saddle. ” (TA.)
حُوَيَّةٌ [a dim. of حَيَّةٌ]: see what next follows.
رَجُلٌ حَوَّآءٌ A man who collects serpents (حَيَّات);
and so ↓ حَاوٍ: [which latter, vulgarly pronounced
حَاوِى, is also now applied to a serpent-charmer;
and a juggler who performs various tricks with
serpents &c.:] (K in art. حى:) or the latter,
(S in that art.,) or both, (T in that art.,) an
owner of serpents; (T, S;) and so حَاىٍ: (T:)
the pl. of حَاوٍ is حُوَاةٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,]
↓ الحَوَّآءُ الحُوَيَّةُ (assumed tropical:)  The constellations Serpentarius
and Serpens. (Kzw.)
حَاوٍ: see what next precedes.
حَاوِيَةٌ: see حَوِيَّةٌ, in three places.
حَاوِيَآءُ: see حَوِيَّةٌ, in two places.
حَاوِىٌّ: see حَائِىٌّ, in art. حوأ.
حَيَّةٌ [meaning A serpent] is said by some to be
from تَحَوَّى, because what is so termed gathers
itself together, and winds, or coils, itself; (ISd, *
K, * TA;) and to be originally حَوْيَةٌ; (TA in art.
حى;) and their opinion is strengthened by the
forms and meaning of the words حَوَّآءٌ and حَاوٍ
(TA) [and by the form and meaning of the word
مَحْوَاةٌ]: or the حيّة is so called because of the
length of its life (لِطُولِ حَيَاتِهَا). (K. [See the
next art.])
أَحْوَى: see art. حو.
أَحْوِىٌّ: see art. حو.
محوى [app. مَحْوًى]: see حِوَآءٌ.
أَرْضٌ مَحْوَاةٌ A land abounding with حَيَّات [or
serpents]: (TA:) or containing serpents; as also
مَحْيَاةٌ. (Ibn-Es-Sarráj, S in art. حى.)
مَحْوِىٌّ pass. part. n. of حَوَاهُ. (Msb.)
مُحَوًّى: see حِوَآءٌ.
محتوى [app. مُحْتَوًى]: see حِوَآءٌ.
حى: or حى and حيو
1
حَيِىَ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) and حَىَّ, (S, K,)
which latter is the more common, (Fr, S,) [like
مَلَّ, originally مَلِلَ,] dual حَيِيَا, and حَيَّا, (Fr,)
pl. حَيُوا, (Fr, S,) like خَشُوا, (S,) and حَيُّوا, (Fr,
S,) as some say, (S,) aor. يَحْيَا, (S, Msb, K,) and
يَحَىُّ, (Fr, K,) [like يَمَلُّ, originally يَمْلَلُ,] occurring in poetry, but improper, and disallowed by
the Basrees, (Fr,) inf. n. حَيَاةٌ [q. v. infrà], (IB,
Mgh, Msb,) or حَيَآءٌ, (K,) and حِىٌّ and حَيَوَانٌ,
(IB,) which last has an intensive signification,
like its contr. مَوَتَانٌ, (Msb,) He, or it, lived;
or was, or became, in the state termed حَيَاةٌ, explained below. (S, K.) [The inf. n. حَيَوَانٌ (q. v.
infrà) suggests the supposition that حَيِىَ may be
originally حَيِوَ; but I find no authority for this
supposition; and if it be the case, this verb presents the only instance of a root of which the
medial radical letter is ى and the final و.] ―
-b2-
حَيُوا, said of a people, or company of men, (assumed tropical:)  They
were, or became, in good condition: (AA, S:) or
they were, or became, fat, by having the means of
subsistence, بَعْدَ هُزَالٍ [after leanness]. (AZ. [See
also 4.]) ―
-b3-  You say also, حَيَّتِ النَّارُ, inf. n. حَيَاةٌ
and حَيَآءٌ, (assumed tropical:)  [The fire was, or became, alive, or
burning,] like as you say, مَاتَت. (AHn.) ―
-b4-
حَيِىَ الطَّرِيقُ (assumed tropical:)  The road, or way, was, or became,
apparent, or distinct. (K.) One says, إِذَا حَيِىَ
لَكَ الطَّرِيقُ فَخُذْ يَمْنَةً (assumed tropical:)  [When the road, or way,
becomes apparent, or distinct, to thee, take to the
right]. (TA.) ―
-b5-  حَيِىَ and حَيِىَ مِنْهُ, aor. يَحْيَا,

حَيَّاكَ اللّٰهُ, (S, K,) meaning May God preserve
thee alive; prolong thy life; or make thee to continue in life; syn. أَبْقَاكَ; (Fr, Selemeh Ibn-
'Ásim, K;) as also ↓ احياك; (Selemeh Ibn-'Ásim,
TA;) or عَمَّرَكَ: (Aboo-'Othmán El-Mázinee,
Mgh, TA:) or may God save thee; or make thee
to be free from evil, or harm, or the like: (Fr,
TA:) or may God make thee to have dominion:
(Fr, S, K:) or may God honour thee, and benefit
thee. (Ham. p. 489.) And حَيَّاكَ اللّٰهُ وَبَيَّاكَ [explained in art. بى]. (TA.) And حَيَّا اللّٰهُ وَجْهَكَ
[May God preserve thy face: see مُحَيًّا]. (Ham
p. 23.) ―
-b2-  Also He said to him حَيَّاكَ اللّٰهُ, explained
above: (Mgh:) originally, he prayed for his life:
and then, he prayed for him, absolutely: (Msb:)
he saluted him; (K, TA;) and so حيّاهُ تَحِيَّةَ
المُؤْمِنِ: (Lh, TA:) as used in the language of
the law, he said to him, سَلَامٌ عَلَيْكَ. (Msb.) ―
-b3-
[See also تَحِيَّةٌ, below.]
-A2-  حيّا الخَمْسِينَ [in the
CK (erroneously) الخَمْسِينَ ↓ حَىَّ] He approached

↓ أَحْيَيْتُهَا [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  I gave life to, enlivened, or

in art. رهب; where a similar meaning is assigned
to the former verb; but perhaps it is there a
mistranscription.] مُحَايَاةٌ also signifies Nourishment (غِذَآء [which is properly speaking a subst.,
but seems to be here used as an inf. n.,]) for, or
of a child, (K, TA,) with that whereby is his
life, or, as in the M, because thereby is his life.
(TA.)
4
احياهُ, (S, Msb, K, &c.,) inf. n. إِحْيَآءٌ, (TA,)
said of God, (S, Msb,) He made him alive, to
live, or be a living being; quickened, endued with
life, vivified, [revivified, revived, or resuscitated,]
him. (S, * Msb, * K.) Hence, in the Kur [lxxv.
last verse], أَلَيْسَ ذٰلِكَ بِقَادِرٍ أَنْ يُحْيِىَ المَوْتَى,
(S, TA,) i. e. Is not That Doer of these things
(Jel) [able to quicken the dead?]. ―
-b2-  See also 2,
in two places. ―
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  He (God) endued him with
the intellectual faculty: as in the saying, in
the Kur [vi. 122], أَوَمَنْ كَانَ مَيِّتًا فَأَحْيَيْنَاهُ
(assumed tropical:)  [And is he who was intellectually dead and
whom we have endued with the intellectual

-b4-  See also 3.
―
-b5-  احيا الأَرْضَ (assumed tropical:)  He (God) revived the earth, or

And احيا المَوَاتِ (tropical:)  He turned to use the unowned
and unused and uncultivated land by walling it
round or sowing it or building upon it and the like.
(TA.) ―
-b6-  Also (assumed tropical:)  He (a man) found the land to
be fruitful, or abundant in herbage, (S, K,) with
fresh herbage. (K.) ―
-b7-  احيا اللَّيْلَ (assumed tropical:)  He passed
the night in religious service, worship, adoration,
or devotion, abstaining from sleep: (TA:) or
[simply] he remained awake during the night.
(W p. 9.) And احيا لَيْلَتَهُ He passed his night
awake. (MA.)
-A2-  احيت النَّاقَةُ The she-camel had
living offspring; (S, K;) her offspring seldom,
or never, died. (S.) ―
-b2-  احيا القَوْمُ The people, or
company of men, had their cattle living: (K:)
or had their cattle in good condition: (AA, S,
K:) or had rain, so that their beasts obtained
herbage to such a degree that they became fat:
(AZ:) or they (themselves) became in a state
of abundance of herbage, or plenty. (S, K. [See
also 1.])
5
تحيّا مِنْهُ (assumed tropical:)  He shrank from it: taken from
الحَيَآءُ [or الحَيَاةُ]; because it is of the nature of
the living to shrink: or it is originally تَحَوَّى;
the و being changed into ى; or [in other words]
from الحَىُّ “ the act of collecting,” [inf. n. of
حَوَاهُ,] like تَحَيَّزَ from الحَوْزُ. (TA.) [See
also 10.]
6
تَحَايَا as quasi-pass. of 3, He quickened,
enlivened, or revived, himself. See an ex. voce
رُوحٌ.]
10
استحياهُ He spared him; let him live; or
left him alive; (S, Msb, K, TA;) did not slay
him; (Msb;) in which sense the verb has but
one form: (Msb, TA:) or he left him; let him
alone; or forbore from him. (Mgh.) ―
-b2-  Hence,
as some say, (K,) إِنَّ اللّٰهَ لَا يَسْتَحْيِى أَنْ يَضْرِبَ
مَثَلًا, (S, K,) in the Kur [ii. 24], i. e. لَا يَسْتَبْقِى
[meaning Verily God will not spare to propound,
or refrain from propounding, a parable, or as a
parable]. (S.) [Hence, also,] إِنَّ اللّٰهَ يَسْتَحْيِى
مِنْ ذِى الشَّيْبَةِ المُسْلِمِ أَنْ يُعَذِّبَهُ, i. e. [Verily
God] forbears from punishing [the hoary Muslim]. (Er-Rághib.) ―
-b3-  [اِسْتَحْيَى, or اِسْتَحْيَا, which
latter is the more proper mode of writing it, also
signifies He felt, or had a sense of, or he was,
or became, moved or affected with, shame, shyness, or bashfulness; and particularly, but not
always, honest shame, or pudency, or modesty;
or his soul shrank from foul things; as also
اِسْتَحَى; and ↓ حَيِىَ, inf. n. حَيَآءٌ.] استحيى is
of the dial. of El-Hijáz; and استحى, with a
single ى, is of the dial. of Temeem; (Akh, S,
Msb;) the former being the original, (Akh, S,)
and that which is used in the Kur: (Msb:) in the
latter, the first ى [of the original] is suppressed,
[and its vowel is transferred to the ح,] to facilitate
the pronunciation, because of the occurrence of
the two ى s together: this is the opinion of Sb;
and with it agrees that of Aboo-'Othmán [ElMázinee]: the opinion ascribed to Sb in the S,
namely, that اِسْتَحَيْتُ is changed from اِسْتَحْيَيْتُ
in like manner as اِسْتَبَعْتُ is changed from
اِسْتَبٌيَعْتُ, is that of Kh, and is disallowed by
El-Mázinee. (IB.) You say, استحيى منه, (S,
K, [in the CK, erroneously, عَنْهُ,]) or استحيا منه,
(Mgh, Msb,) and استحى منه, and استحياهُ, (S,
Msb, K, TA,) and استحاهُ; (TA, [and so in the
CK in the place of استحياهُ;]) as also منه ↓ حَيِىَ,
(S, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor. يَحْيَا, (S,) inf. n. حَيَآءٌ;
(S, * Mgh, Msb, K;) He was ashamed of it or
on account of it, or ashamed to do it, or shy of
doing it; [generally meaning a foul thing;] he
was ashamed for himself, or of himself, or was bashful, or shy, with respect to it, or him; he was
abashed at, or shy of, it, or him; (K;) he shrank
from it, or him: (Msb, K: *) and استحيى مِنْ
كَذَا [or استحيا] He disdained, or scorned, such
a thing; abstained from it, or refused to do it,
by reason of disdain and pride; he dislike, or
hated, it, and his soul was above it; he shunned
it, avoided it, or kept himself far from it; syn.
أَنِفَ مِنْهُ. (TA.)
حَىَّ a verbal noun, (S, M, Mgh, TA,) and
therefore immediately followed by عَلَى, (M, TA,)
used as an imperative [addressed to a single
person, male or female, and to more than one];
(S;) used in calling, or summoning, or inviting,
and urging; (Lth, T, TA;) and having no verb
derived from it [alone, for حَيْعَلَ is derived from
حَىَّ and عَلَى together]; (Lth, T, Msb, TA;)
meaning Come: (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K, TA, &c.:)
or come quickly: or hasten. (Mgh, TA.) Hence,
حَىَّ عَلَى الصَّلَاهٌ (in the أَذَان, TA) Come to
prayer: (IKt, S, M, Msb, K:) or come ye to
prayer: or come ye quickly: or hasten ye. (TA.)
And حَىَّ عَلَى الفَلَاحْ [in the same: see art.
فلح]. (Mgh, TA.) And حَىَّ عَلَى الغَدَآءِ [Come
to the morning-meal]: and على العَشَآءِ [to the
evening-meal]: (Msb:) and على الثَّرِيدِ [to the
crumbled bread moistened with broth]: (S:)
and على الخَيْرِ [to good, good fortune, prosperity,
&c.]. (Lth, T, TA.) The saying of Ibn-Ahmar,
حَىَّ الحُمُولَ فَإِنَّ الرَّكْبَ قَدْ ذَهَبَا
means Keep thou to the loads [for the riders
upon the camels have gone]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  In the
phrase حَىَّ هَلَ, and حَىَّ هَلًا, followed by عَلَى
كَذَا and إِلَى كَذَا, and حَىَّ هَلَا, (K,) which
last is used in a case of pausation, but is bad in
other cases, (S in art. هل,) and حَىَّ هَلْ, and
حَيَّهْل, [so in the copies of the K,] with the ه
quiescent, (K,) and حىّ هلن [app. حَىَّ هَلَنْ,
for حَىَّ هَلًا, or perhaps a mistranscription for
حَىَّ هَلَكَ], (TA,) [the most common rendering
of حَىَّ هَلَ &c. is like that of حَىَّ alone, namely,
Come: or] حىّ signifies hasten thou; and [هل
or] هلا, come to it, or reach it; [so that the
meaning is hasten thou: come to such a thing:]
or حىّ signifies come; and [هل or] هلا, quickly
(حَثِيثًا), or be thou quick; [so that the meaning
is come quickly to such a thing:] or [هل or]
هلا signifies be thou quiet; and the meaning
is أَسْرِعْ عِنْدَ ذِكْرِهِ وَاسْكُنْ حَتَّى يَنْقَضِىَ [Speed
thou at the mention thereof, and be quiet
until it is finished]. (K.) Accord. to Abu-lKhattáb, the Arabs used to say, حَىَّ هَلَ الصَّلَاةَ,
meaning Come thou to prayer. (TA.) And one
says, حَىَّ هَلْ بِفُلَانٍ, (IAar, and so in the CK,)
and حَىَّ هَلًا بفلان, (IAar, and so in MS. copies
of the K,) and حَىَّ هَلَ بفلان, meaning Hasten
thou with such a one: (IAar:) or keep thou to such
a one, and call him. (K.) It is said in a trad.,
إِذَا ذُكِرَ الصَّالِحُونَ فِحَىَّ هَلَ بِعُمَرَ, (S in art.
هل,) or فَحَيَّهَلًا بِعُمَرَ, (TA,) i. e. [When the good,
or righteous, are mentioned, then] keep thou to
'Omar, and call 'Omar, (S ubi suprà, and TA,)
and begin with him, and be quick in mentioning
him; (TA;) for he is of such. (S ubi suprà.)
Accord. to some of the grammarians, (TA,) when
you say حَىَّ هَلًا, with tenween, it is as though
you said حَثًّا; and without tenween, it is as
though you said الحَثَّ; the tenween being made
a sign of indeterminateness; and the omission
of it, a sign of determinateness: and so it is
in all compounds of this kind. (K.) [See also
art. هل.]
حَىٌّ Living, having life, alive, or quick; contr.
of مَيِّتٌ [or مَيْتٌ]; (S, Mgh, * Msb, * K;) and
↓ حَيَوَانٌ is syn. with حَىٌّ [as meaning having
animal life]: (IB:) dim. of the former ↓ حُيَىٌّ:
(Msb:) and pl. أحْيَآءٌ. (Msb, K.) When you
say of a person, لَيْسَ بِحَىٍّ, you mean that he
is dead: (Lh:) but مِنْهَا ↓ ضُرِبَ ضَرْبَةً لَيْسَ بِحَاىٍ,
(Lh, K,) [in the CK ضَرَبَ, and] in [some of]
the copies of the K, erroneously, بِحَآءٍ, (TA,)
means [He was struck a blow] in consequence
of which he will not live: (Lh, K: *) like as the
saying لَا تَأْكُلْ كَذَا فَإِنَّكَ مَارِضٌ means Thou
wilt be sick if thou eat such a thing. (Lh, K.)
Accord. to ISh, one says, أَتَانَا حَىُّ فُلَانٍ, meaning Such a one came to us in his life [-time]:
and سَمِعْتُ حَىَّ فُلَانٍ يَقُولُ كَذَا, meaning I
heard such a one say thus in his life [-time]:
(TA:) [or the former may mean Such a one
himself came to us: and the latter, I heard such
a one himself say thus: for] حى [i. e. حَىّ as
a prefixed noun] is sometimes redundant, like
آل and ذُو: (Ham p. 308:) [and] IB says that
حَىُّ فُلَانٍ means Such a one himself. (TA.)
And they say, أَهْلِكَ ↓ كَيْفَ أَنْتَ وَحَيَّةُ, i. e. How
art thou, and those remaining alive of thy
family? (TA.) ―
-b2-  Applied to God, Deathless.
(Er-Rághib.) ―

possessing the faculty of sensation. (Er-Rághib.)
―

-b6-  (assumed tropical:)  Lively,
as meaning free from grief or sorrow. (Er-Rághib.)

land abounding with herbage; (K, TA;) like
as ارض مَيْتَةٌ means unfruitful land. (TA.) ―
-b9-
الشَّمْسُ حَيَّةٌ (assumed tropical:)  The sun is, or was, of a clear colour,
unaltered by approaching the place of setting;
as though its setting were regarded as death:
(TA:) or still bright and white: or still hot and
powerful: but the former of these two meanings
is the more probable. (Mgh.) ―
-b10-  نَارٌ حَيَّةٌ (assumed tropical:)  [A
live, or burning, fire. (AHn.) ―
-b11-  طَرِيقٌ حَىٌّ
(assumed tropical:)  An apparent, or a distinct, road or way:

children, or descendants, of one father or ancestor,
whether many or few: and a شَعْب comprising
قَبَائِل: (Az, TA:) or a قَبِيلَة of the Arabs: (Msb:)
or a بَطْن of the بُطُون of the Arabs: (K, TA:)
pl. أَحْيَآءٌ. (S, Msb, K.)
-A4-  The vulva, or external
portion of the organs of generation, of a woman.
(Az, K. See also حَيَآءٌ, of which حَىٌّ is also
said to be a pl.) Hence, سَعَفُ الحَىِّ, applied by
an Arab of the desert to The paraphernalia of a
bride. (Az, TA.)
-A5-  لَاحَىَّ عَنْهُ means لَامَنْعَ مِنْهُ,
(Ks, K, *) i. e. [There is no forbiddance of him;
or] nothing is forbidden him. (Fr.)
-A6-  لَا يَعْرِفُ
الحَىَّ مِنَ اللَّىِّ He knows not, or will not know,
what is true from what is false; (IAar, K, Har
p. 236;) and so الحَوَّ من اللَّوِّ: (TA:) or the
حَوِيَّة [or winding gut, &c.,] from the twisting of
the rope: (K:) or overt speech from covert: or
the living from the dead: or the act of turning

of which حَىٌّ is an inf. n.,] from the act of
twisting. (Har ubi suprà.)
-A7-  The act of collecting. (TA. [But in this and some other senses it is
an inf. n. of حَوَى: see 1 in art. حوى.])
-A8-  أَحْيَآءٌ
as pl. of حَآءٌ: see art. حوأ.
حِىٌّ: see حَيَاةٌ, of which it is said to be a syn.:
and of which it is also said to be a pl.:
-A2-  and
see حَيَآءٌ, of which, also, it is said to be a pl.
حَيَّةٌ [A serpent;] a certain thing well known:
(K, TA:) [improperly explained in the Msb
as syn. with أَفْعًى:] applied to the male and the
female; (S, Msb;) the ة being added to denote
one of a kind, as in بَطَّةٌ and دَجَاجَةٌ; [although
حَىٌّ is not used as a coll. gen. n.; and] although
the saying عَلَى حَيَّةٍ ↓ رَأَيْتُ حَيًّا, as meaning [I
saw] a male [serpent] upon a female [serpent],
is related as having been heard from the Arabs:
(S:) but ↓ حَيُّوتٌ is also applied to the male;
(Az, S, K;) the ت being augmentative; for the
word is originally حَيُّو [or حَيُّوٌّ]: (Az, TA:) it
is said that it does not die unless by an accident:
and they say of a long-lived man, مَا هُوَ إِلَّا حَيَّةٌ
[He is none other than a serpent]; and in like
manner they say of a woman; as though it were
called حيّة because of its long life: [for] some,
including Sb, say that it is derived from حَيَاةٌ, as
the rel. n. is حَيَوِىٌّ, not حَوَوِىٌّ: and to him who
objects that one says رَجُلٌ حَوَّآءٌ [meaning “ a man
who collects serpents ”], it is replied that حَيَّةٌ
and حَوَّآءٌ are of different roots, like لُؤْلُؤٌ and لَأّلٌ,
&c.: but it may be from تَحَوَّى, because of its
winding, or coiling, itself; and some say that
it is originally حَوْيَةٌ; some, that it is originally
حَيْوَةٌ: (TA:) [the dim. is ↓ حُيَيَّةٌ:] the pl. is
حَيَّاتٌ (K) and حَيْوَاتٌ, (K, TA,) or حَيَوَاتٌ. (So
in some copies of the K [agreeably with the dial.
of Hudheyl].) Hence the prov. هُوَ أَبْصَرُ مِنْ حَيَّةٍ
[He is more sharp-sighted than a serpent];
because of the sharpness of its sight: and أَظْلَمُ
مِنْ حَيَّةٍ [more wrongful in conduct than a
serpent]; because it comes to the burrow of the
[lizard called] ضَبّ, and eats its young one, and
takes up its abode in its burrow. (TA.) And
سَقَاهُ اللّٰهُ دَمَ الحَيَّاتِ [May God give him to drink
the blood of the serpents]; i. e., (assumed tropical:)  destroy him.
(TA.) And ↓ لَا تَلِدُ الحَيَّةُ إِلَّا حُيَيَّةً [The serpent
does not bring forth anything save a little serpent]: a prov. applied to the cunning and mischievous, or malignant. (TA.) And فُلَانٌ حَيَّةُ
الوَادِى, or الأَرْضِ, or البَلَدِ, or الحَمَاطِ, (assumed tropical:)  Such a one
is cunning and mischievous, or malignant, (IAar,
K,) and intelligent, in the utmost degree: (IAar:)
[or] فلان حيّة الوادى means (assumed tropical:)  such a one is
strong in resisting, a defender of his possessions.
(TA.) And حَيَّةُ الوَادِى is also an appellation
applied to (assumed tropical:)  The lion; (K, TA;) because of his
cunning, or craftiness. (TA.) One says also,
هُمْ حَيَّةُ الأَرْضِ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  They are cunning,
guileful, malignant, or mischievous, and strong,
not neglecting to take blood-revenge: so in a
saying of Dhu-l-Isba' El-'Adwánee cited voce
عَذِيرٌ. (TA.) And فُلَانٌ حَيَّةٌ ذَكَرٌ (S, TA) (assumed tropical:)  Such
a one is courageous and strong. (TA.) And
رَأْسُهُ رَأْسُ حَيَّةٍ (assumed tropical:)  He is clever, or ingenious; acute,
or sharp; intelligent. (TA.) And رَأَيْتُ فى كِتَابِهِ
حَيَّاتِ وَعَقَارِبَ (assumed tropical:)  I saw in his letter slanders, or
calumnies, addressed to the ruling power, in order
to cause the object thereof to fall into embarrassment from which escape would be difficult. (TA.)
―
-b2-  الحَيَّةُ is also a name of (assumed tropical:)  [The constellation
Draco; commonly called التِّنِّينُ;] certain stars
[partly] between the فَرْقَدَانِ [or B and y of Ursa
Minor] and بَنَاتُ نَعْشٍ [meaning the stars in the
tail of Ursa Major]: (K:) so called by way of
comparison. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And حَيَّةٌ also signifies
(assumed tropical:)  A certain mark made with a hot iron upon
the neck, and upon the thigh, of a camel, twisting,
or winding, like the حَيَّة [properly so called]. (Ibn-
Habeeb, TA.)
-A2-  See also حَىٌّ.
حَيًا Rain; (S, Msb, K;) as also ↓ حَيَآءٌ: (K:)
or much rain: (Har p. 185:) as being the means
of giving life to the earth: (TA:) and (assumed tropical:)  plenty;
or abundance of herbage, (S, K,) and the means
of giving life to the earth and to men; as being
caused by the rain; and so ↓ حَيَآءٌ: (TA:) or
[simply] herbage; because produced by the rain:
and fat, and fatness; because produced by the
herbage: (Ham p. 662:) dual. حَيَيَانِ: (S:)
and pl. أَحْيَآءٌ. (TA.) حَيَا الرَّبِيعِ means The rain
[called ربيع, or of the season thus called,] that
gives life to the earth. (TA.)
-A2-  See also the next
paragraph.
حَيَآءٌ an inf. n. of حَيِىَ in the first of the senses
explained in this art. (K.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] syn. with
حَيًا, in two senses: see the next preceding paragraph, in two places. ―
-b3-  Also inf. n. of حَيِىَ as
syn. with اِسْتَحْيَى; (S, * Mgh, Msb, K;) i. q.
اِسْتِحْيَآءٌ; (S;) Shame; a sense of shame; shyness, or bashfulness; [and particularly, but not
always, honest shame, or pudency, or modesty;]
syn. حِشْمَةٌ; (K;) a shrinking of the soul from
foul conduct, (Bd in ii. 24, and Er-Rághib,)
through fear of blame; (Bd ibid.;) a languor
that affects the animal faculty, (Bd ibid, and
Mgh, *) and turns it back from its actions: (Bd:)
and repentance; syn. تَوْبَةٌ. (K.) ―
-b4-  And hence,
as being a thing that should be concealed, and of
which one is ashamed to speak plainly, (TA,) The
vulva, or external portion of the female organs of
generation, (فَرْج, El-Fárábee, Msb, K, or رَحِم,
[which here means the same,] S,) of a camel,
(El-Fárábee, S, Msb, K,) or an animal having
feet like those of the camel, and of a cloven-hoofed
animal, and of a beast of prey: (K:) accord. to
AZ, the دُبُر [here meaning the same as فَرْج] of
any of these and of other animals: (Msb:)
accord. to IAar, it is of the ewe or she-goat, the
cow, and the gazelle: (ISd, TA:) and [sometimes] the فَرْج of a girl, (El-Fárábee, Msb,:) or
of a woman: (Zj in his “ Khalk el-Insán: ” [see
also حَىٌّ:]) and ↓ حَيًا signifies the same; (K;)
but accord. to Az, this is not allowable except in
poetry, in a case of necessity: (TA:) pl. أَحْيَآءٌ
(AZ, IJ, K) and أَحْيِيَةٌ (As, Sb, S, K) and, by
contraction, أَحِيَّةٌ, (Sb, IB, TA,) which is said to
be preferable, (TA,) and [quasi-pl. n.] ↓ حَىٌّ and
↓ حِىٌّ [which two have been mistaken by Freytag
for syns. of تَحِيَّةٌ, immediately following them in
the K]. (Sb, K.)
حَيَاةٌ, or ↓ حَيٰوة, (as in different copies of the K,
in the latter manner in copies of the S,) written
with و in the Kur, to show that و follows ى in
the pl. [حَيَوَاتٌ, like صَلَوَاتٌ], or because the sound
of the ا is inclined towards that of و, (ISd, TA,)
and ↓ حَيَوْةٌ, with sukoon to the و, (K,) which is
substituted for the ا of حَيَاةٌ, as is done by the
people of El-Yemen in the case of every ا that
is changed from و, as in صَلَاةٌ and زَكَاةٌ, though
the final radical letter of the verb of حَيَاةٌ is ى,
(TA,) an inf. n. of حَيِىَ in the first of the senses
explained in this art.; (IB, Mgh, Msb;) Life;
contr. of مَوْتٌ; (S, K;) as also ↓ حَيَوَانٌ and
↓ حِىٌّ, (K,) or this last is asserted to be a pl. of
حَيٰوةٌ, (S,) and as also ↓ مَحْيًا, (S, * Har pp. 25
and 350,) of which the pl. is مَحَاىٍ: (S:) حَيَاةٌ
signifies the faculty of growth, as in an animal,
and in a plant: and the faculty of sensation:
and (assumed tropical:)  the faculty of intellect: and (assumed tropical:)  freedom from
grief or sorrow: and everlasting life in the world
to come; to which one attains by that حياة which
is intelligence and knowledge: and the حياة that
is an attribute of God. (Er-Rághib.) يَا لَيْتَنِى
قَدَّمْتُ لِحَيَاتِى, in the Kur [lxxxix. 25], means
[O, would that I had prepared, or laid up in
store,] for my everlasting state of existence. (Er-Rághib.) And ↓ فَإِنَّ الدَّارَ الآخِرَةَ لَهِىَ الحَيَوَانُ,
in the Kur [xxix. 64], means [And verily the last
abode is] the abode of everlasting life: (TA:) or
الحيوان here means the life that will not be followed by death: or much life; like as مَوَتَانٌ
signifies much death: (Msb:) and it is also the
name of a certain fountain in Paradise, [the
water of] which touches nothing but it lives, by
permission of God. (TA.) الحَيٰوةُ الطَّيِّبَةُ, accord.
to I'Ab, explaining xvi. 99 of the Kur, (TA,)
means Lawful means of subsistence (K, TA) in
the present world: (TA:) or Paradise. (K,
TA.) ―
-b2-  Also (assumed tropical:)  Advantage, or profit; or a cause,
or means, thereof: whence the saying, لَيْسَ لِفُلَانٍ
حَيَاةٌ There is not, in such a one, profit, nor good:
and so it is said to mean in the Kur [ii. 175],
وَلَكُمْ فِى القِصَاصِ حَيٰوةٌ (assumed tropical:)  [And there is to you, in
retaliation, an advantage]: (TA:) or this means
that the knowledge of the law of retaliation restrains from slaughter, and so is a cause of life to
two persons; and because they used to slay one
who was not the slayer, retaliation upon the slayer
is a cause of saving the lives of the rest: or the
meaning is life in the world to come; for when
the slayer has suffered retaliation in the present
world, he is not punished for his act in the world
to come. (Bd.) ―
-b3-  حَيَاةُ الشَّمْسِ means (assumed tropical:)  The remaining of the light and whiteness of the sun: or
the remaining of its heat and power: but the
former of these two meanings is the more probable. (Mgh. [See الشَّمْسُ حَيَّةٌ, voce حَىٌّ.])
حَيٰوةٌ and حَيَوْةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
حَيِىٌّ Having حَيَآء [i. e. shame, shyness, bashfulness, pudency, or modesty]; (K;) part. n. of
حَيِىَ as syn. with استحيى; of the measure فَعِيلٌ:
(Msb:) fem. حَيِيَّةٌ. (TA.) The saying of I'Ab,
اَللّٰهُ حَيِىٌّ, means God is one who acts with others
in the manner of him who has حَيَآء; for حَيَآء in
its proper sense is not ascribable to Him: (Mgh:)
or one who leaves undone evil deeds, and does good
deeds. (Er-Rághib.)
حُيَىٌّ: see حَىٌّ, of which it is the dim.
حُيَيَّةٌ: see حَيَّةٌ, (of which it is the dim.,) in
two places.
-A2-  And dim. of حَآءٌ, q. v. in art. حوأ.
(Lth, TA in باب الالف الليّنة.)
حَيَوِىٌّ [Of, or relating to, the serpent;] rel. n.
of حَيَّةٌ. (S.)
-A2-  [And rel. n. of حَا: see حَائِىٌّ in
art. حوأ.]
حَيَوَانٌ an inf. n. of حَيِىَ, like حَيَاةٌ, (IB,) but
having an intensive signification: (Msb:) see
حَيَاةٌ, in two places. ―
-b2-  See also حَىٌّ, first sentence. ―
-b3-  Also Any thing, or things, possessing
animal life, (Msb, K, *) whether rational or irrational; [an animal, and animals;] used alike
as sing. and pl., because originally an inf. n.;
(Msb;) contr. of مَوَتَانٌ [q. v.]. (S.) [حَيَوَانَاتٌ
is used as its pl. of pauc. And hence,] الحَيَوَانَاتُ
الخَمْسُ [The five animals] is applied to what may
be killed by a person in the state of إِحْرَام, and
by one engaged in prayer: (Msb in art. فسق:)
these are the rat, or mouse, and the biting dog, and
either the serpent, the crow termed أَبْقَع, and the
kite, or the serpent, the scorpion, and the kite, or
the serpent, the scorpion, and the crow, or the
scorpion, the crow, and the kite. (Es-Suyootee,
in “ El-Jámi' es-Sagheer,” voce خَمْسٌ.) It is
originally حَيَيَانٌ; (Sb, K, TA;) the ى which is
the final radical letter being changed into و
because the occurrence of two ى together is
disliked: (Sb, TA:) Aboo-'Othmán [El-Má-
zinee] holds the و to be a radical letter; but his
opinion is said to be not admissible, because it is
asserted that there is no instance in the language
of a word of which the medial radical is ى, and
the final و. (TA.)
حَيَوَانِىٌّ [Of, or relating to, an animal or animals]. ―
-b2-  It is [also] particularly applied to A
seller of birds. (TA.)
[
حَيَوَانِيَّةٌ Animality; or animal nature.]
حَيُّوتٌ: see حَيَّةٌ.
حَاىٍ, of the measure فَاعِلٌ, [said to be] originally حَايِوٌ, is syn. with حَاوٍ and حَوَّآءٌ, belonging
to art. حوى [q. v.]. (Az, TA.)
أُحَىُّ and أُحَىٌّ and أُحَىٍّ: see art. حو.
أُحَيْوٍ: see art. حو.
أَحْيَى in the saying أَحْيَى مِنْ ضَبٍّ [More longlived than a ضبّ, a kind of lizard, which is supposed to live seven hundred years,] is from الحَيَاةُ.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  In the sayings أَحْيَى مِنْ هَدِىٍّ [More
shy, or bashful, than the bride] and أَحْيَى مِنْ
مُخَدَّرَةٍ [More shy, or bashful, than a girl kept
behind the curtain] it is from الحَيَآءُ. (TA.)
تِحْيَاةٌ: see the next paragraph.
التَّحَايِى The two stars in the foot and before
the foot of the foremost of Gemini: (Kzw:) or
three stars over against الهَنْعَة [which is the Sixth
Mansion of the Moon]; (IKt, K;) and sometimes the moon deviates from الهنعة, and makes
its abode in التحايى: (IKt:) they are between
the Milky Way and the stars that follow العَيُّوق
[or Capella]: Aboo-Ziyád El-Kilábee used to say
that this name means الهنعة, and is also pronounced
التَّحَائِى, withء: but AHn says that the moon
makes its abode in these stars, and not in الهنعة
itself: (TA:) its sing. is ↓ تِحْيَاةٌ; (IKt, AHn,
TA;) if so, of the measure تِفْعَلَةٌ, like تِحْلَبَةٌ, not
فِعْلَاةٌ, like عِزْهَاةٌ, because there is no such root as
تَحى; derived from الحَيَا, because its نَوْء [here
meaning its auroral setting, in midwinter,] is attended with much rain: but التحائى, with ء, is
irreg.; as though pl. of ↓ تَحِيَّةٌ likened to a word
of the measure فَعِيلَةٌ. (IB.)
تَحِيَّةٌ inf. n. of 2. (Mgh, Msb, K.) ―
-b2-  Also
A salutation, or greeting, (A'Obeyd, AHeyth,
Mgh, Msb,) pronounced by one person to another
on their meeting; (AHeyth;) particularly the
saying سَلَامٌ عَلَيْكَ; (Mgh, * Msb;) and the like;
(Mgh;) the most comprehensive form thereof,
used by the believer [to his fellow-believer], being
the saying السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَةُ اللّٰهِ وَبَرَكَاتُهُ:
(AHeyth:) hence it is pluralized; the pl. being
تَحِيَّاتٌ and تَحَايَا. (Mgh.) ―
-b3-  Also Continuance,
or endurance; or endless, or everlasting, existence:
(IAar, Msb, K, &c.:) and so it is said to mean
in the following verse of Zuheyr Ibn-Jenáb ElKelbee; who was a [kind of] king among his
people:
قَدْ نِلْتُهُ إِلَّا التَّحِيَّهْ  وَلَكُلُّ مَا نَالَ الفَتَى
[And indeed everything that the young man has
attained, I have attained it, except endless existence]: or, as some say, it here means security
from death and from evils. (TA. [But more
probably the meaning is that next following: for
in the Mz, 49th نوع, where this verse is cited, but
with مِنْ كُلِّ in the place of وَلَكُلُّ, he is said to
have been (not a king, but,) “ a nobleman. ” See
also, respecting him, p. x. of my Preface.]) And
(tropical:)  Dominion, or kingship: (Fr, AA, S, Mgh, Msb,
K, &c.:) because the people of the Time of Ignorance used to greet kings [or rather those of
Himyer] by the saying أَبَيْتَ الَّعْنَ, which they
addressed to none other than a king; so that when
any one of them became a king, it was said of
him, فُلَانٌ نَالَ التَّحِيَّةَ [meaning (tropical:)  Such a one has
attained the kingship]. (Mgh: in which, and in
the S, the foregoing verse is cited as an ex. of this
last meaning.) التَّحِيَّاتُ لِلّٰهِ means Endless existence belongs to God: (Lth, Msb, TA:) or
dominion, or kingship: (Lth, Yaakoob, S, Msb,
TA:) or freedom, or security, from all evils,
(Khálid Ibn-Yezeed, AHeyth,) and from all
causes of the cessation of existence: (AHeyth:)
or endless existence, and security from evils, and
dominion, and the like: (Fr:) or the expressions
[of praise] that indicate and imply the ascription
of dominion and endless existence: (Kt:) or salutations and benedictions are Gods, and at his
disposal. (Mgh.) [التَّحِيَّاتُ is also a term applied to the following form of words repeated in
the ordinary prayers: التَّحِيَّاتُ لِلّٰهِ وَالصَّلَوَاتُ
وَالطَّيِّبَاتُ السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ يَاأَيُّهَا النَّبِىُّ وَرَحْمَةُ اللّٰهِ
وَبَرَكَاتُهُ السَّلَامُ عَلَيْنَا وَعَلَى عِبَادِ اللّٰهِ الصَّالِحِينَ
أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلَاهَ إِلَّا اللّٰهُ وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدُهُ
وَرَسُولُهُ, or (instead of عبده ورسوله) رَسُولُ اللّٰهِ: see
5 in art. شهد.] ―
-b4-  The assigning to this word, as
used in the Kur iv. 88, the meaning of A gift is
a mistake. (Mgh.)
-A2-  See also التَّحَايِى.
مَحْيًا: see حَيَاةٌ. ―
-b2-  Also A time, and a place,
of life. (TA.)
مُحْىٍ and مُحْيِيَةٌ, applied to a she-camel,
Having living offspring; whose offspring seldom,
or never, die. (S.)
مُحَيًّا The face (S, K, Ham p. 23) of a man,
because it is specified in salutation; [see 2;] (Ham
ubi suprá;) a term used only in praise; (Ham
p. 640;) i. e. the face altogether: or the حُرّ
of the face [i. e. the ball of the cheek; or what
appears of the elevated part thereof; or what
fronts one, of the face, &c.]. (K.) ―
-b2-  Of a horse,
it is The place where the flesh is separated (حيث
انفرق اللحم) beneath the forelock. (Ham p. 23.)
And دَائِرَةُ المُحَيَّا, in a horse, [The feather in] the
place of separation [of the hair] beneath the forelock, in the upper part of the forehead. (TA.)
محَيِّىٌ act. part. n. of 2; fem. مُحَيِّيَةٌ: (S,
TA:) for in every noun in which three ىs occur
together, [the last of them being the final radical,
and ending the word,] if it is not formed from a
verb, the final radical letter is elided from it, as in
عُطَىٌّ the dim. of عَطَآءٌ, and in أُحَىُّ the dim. of
أَحْوَى: but if it is formed from a verb, that letter
remains, as in مُحَيِّىٌ from حَيَّى. (S.)
أَرْضٌ مَحْيَاةٌ i. q. مَحْوَاةٌ, i. e. A land containing
serpents: (Ibn-Es-Sarráj, S:) or abounding with
serpents. (TA in art. حوى.)
أَبُو يَحْيَى Death. (TA, Har p. 218.)
