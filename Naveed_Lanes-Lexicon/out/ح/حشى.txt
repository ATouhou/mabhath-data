حشى1
حَشِىَ, [aor. يَحْشَى,] inf. n. حَشًى, He (a
man walking quickly, and one speaking with
sharpness, or hastiness, of temper, TA) breathed
short, or unintermittedly; panted for breath;
or was out of breath. (S, K, TA.)
-A2-  See also 3.
2
حشّى, (TA,) inf. n. تَحْشِيَةٌ, (KL, TA,) He
made a حَاشِيَة to a garment, or piece of cloth.
(KL.) ―
-b2-  And [hence,] (assumed tropical:)  He wrote a note or
comment, or notes or comments, upon the margin,
or margins, of a book: (KL, TA:) in this sense
it is vulgar [or post-classical]. (TA.)
-A2-  [Also,
app., He, or it, caused one to breathe short or
unintermittedly, to pant for breath, or to be out
of breath: see مُحَشِّيَةُ الكِلَابِ, below.]
3
حاشاهُ مِنْهُمْ, (IAmb, K, &c.,) inf. n. مُحَاشَاةٌ,
(KL,) He set him aside as excluded from the description of them; [excluded him from them;]
did not include him among them: (IAmb, TA:)
from حَشًى meaning the “side” of a thing: (Az,
TA;) he excepted him from them; as also ↓ تحشّاهُ.
(Lh, K, TA.) You say, شَتَمْتُهُمْ وَ مَا حَاشَيْتُ مِنْهُمْ
أَحَدًا and ↓ ما تَحَشَّيْتُ, i. e. [I reviled them and]
I did not say [of any one of them] حَاشَى لِفُلَانٍ
[Far is such a one from being included among
those of whom I speak! or from any cause of
reproach!]; or I did not except, of them, any
one. (Lh, TA. [The same saying is repeated in
the TA, in the supplement to this art. of the K,
but with the substitution of حشيت for حاشيت;
perhaps by a mistake of the copyist: or it may be
inferred from a statement of Fr and IAmb, which
will be found below, that one also says ما
↓ حَشَيْتُ.]) And En-Nábighah [Edh-Dhubyánee]
says, (Mbr, S.)
وَ لَا أَرَى فَاعِلًا فِى النَّاسِ يُشْبِهُهُ
وَ مَا أُحَاشِى مِنَ الأَقْوَامِ مِنْ أَحَدِ
[And I shall not see an actor among mankind
resembling him; and I do not except, of the companies of men, any one]: which shows حَاشِى to
be a verb perfectly inflected. (Mbr, S, Mughnee.)
And hence the trad. of the Prophet, قَال أُسَامَةُ
أَحَبُّ النَّاسِ إِلَىَّ مَا حَاشَى فَاطِمَةَ, i. e. [He said,
Usámeh is the most beloved of men to me:] he did
not except Fátimeh: ما being here a negative;
not, as Ibn-Málik imagines, supposing this
clause to be of the words of the Prophet, the ما
which, with a verb following it, conveys the meaning of an inf. n. (Mughnee.) ―
-b2-  حَاشَى also denotes
exception as a particle, or as a verb (S, Mughnee)
having but one tense and no inf. n., (Mughnee,)
according as it governs a gen. or an accus. case. (S.)
You say, زَيْدٍ ↓ ضَرَبْتُهُمْ حَاشَى [I beat them, except Zeyd], using it as a particle; and ضربتهم
حاشى زَيْدًا, using it as a verb. (S, I 'Ak * p. 169.)
And sometimes one says, قَامَ القَوْمُ مَا حَاشَى زَيْدًا
[The party stood, except Zeyd]; (Mughnee, I' Ak
p. 169;) like مَا خَلَا; though Ibn-Málik [like
Sb] disallows it: (I' Ak:) this being shown to be
allowable by the saying of the poet,
رَأَيْتُ النَّاسَ مَا حَاشَى قُرَيْشًا
فَإِنَّا نَحْنُ أَفْضَلُهُمْ فَعَالَا
[I have seen mankind, except Kureysh, that we
are the most excellent of them in conduct].
(Mughnee, I' Ak p. 170.) The agent of حاشى
[used as a verb having but one tense and no inf. n.]
is a pronoun implied, relating to the inf. n. of the
preceding verb, or to its act. part. n., or to a portion of what is meant by the [preceding] general
noun: so that when one says, قَامَ القَوْمُ حَاشَى
زَيْدًا, the meaning is, [The party stood, but] their
standing, or the stander of them, or a portion of
them, was apart from Zeyd. (Mughnee.) [In the
K, its use as a verb of this kind is not mentioned;
but it is there said to govern the gen. case, like
حَتَّى.] ―
-b3-  It also denotes remoteness from imperfection or the like, or freedom therefrom; as in
the phrase للّٰهِ ↓ حَاشَى [I ascribe unto God remoteness from every imperfection or the like, or
freedom therefrom; generally implying wonder
or admiration, so that it may be rendered, how
far, or how free, is God from every imperfection!]: (Mughnee:) or this phrase means
مَعَاذَ اللّٰهِ [I seek protection by God; or, as often
used by late writers, and in the present day, God
forbid!]; as also للّٰهِ ↓ حَاشَ; (S, K;) the former
being the original expression: (S:) it occurs,
read in both these ways, in the Kur xii. 31
and 51; where it implies wonder at the power of
God as manifested in the creation of such a person as Joseph. (Ksh, Bd.) Mbr and IJ and the
Koofees hold that it is a verb; and that, in the
[latter] verse the meaning is, Joseph hath kept
aloof from disobedience for the sake of God;
but such an interpretation as this is not suitable
in the case of [the former verse,] حَاشَ للّٰهِ مَا هٰذَا
بَشَرًا: the truth is, that it is a noun, syn. with
التَنْزِيه or البَرَآءَة, [accord. to different copies of the
Mughnee, meaning تَنْزِيهًا or بَرَآءَةً,] as is shown by
another reading, للّٰهِ ↓ حَاشًا, with tenween, like
بَرَآءَةً للّٰهِ; and by the reading of Ibn-Mes'ood,
اللّٰهِ ↓ حَاشَ, like مَعَاذَ اللّٰهِ: some assert that it is
a verbal noun, meaning أَتَبَرَّأُ [I assert myself to
be free, or clear, to God], or تَبَرَّأْتُ [I have asserted myself &c.]; but its being decl. in some
dials. contradicts this. (Mughnee.) One says
also, ↓ حَاشَاكَ and لَكَ ↓ حَاشَى [Far art thou from
being included among those of whom I speak!
or from any cause of reproach! or the like]; both
meaning the same. (S, K.) And some of the
Arabs say ↓ حَشَى, (Fr, IAmb, TA,) dropping the
ا (IAmb, TA.) ―
-b4-  Sb says, (S, Mughnee,) with
most of the Basrees, (Mughnee,) that it is only
a particle governing the gen. case, (S, Mughnee,)
syn. with إِلَّا; (Mughnee;) because, if it were a
verb, it would be allowable to make it a connective to مَا, like خَلَا; and this he asserts to be
not allowable. (S.) Mbr says that it is sometimes
a verb; as is shown by the verse of En-Nábighah
cited above; and by the saying حَاشَى لِزَيْدٍ, because a particle cannot be made to precede immediately another particle; and because it suffers
elision, as in the phrase حَاشَ لِزَيْدٍ, seeing that
elision takes place in nouns and verbs only,
exclusively of particles: (S, Mughnee *:) and IJ
and the Koofees say the like: but Mbr also holds,
in common with El-Jarmee and El-Mázinee and
Zj and Akh and AZ and Fr and Aboo-'Amr EshSheybánee, that it is often a particle governing
the gen. case, and seldom a trans. verb having but
one tense and no inf. n., because syn. with إِلَّا.
(Mughnee.)

تحشّى [He went aside, apart, or aloof, or
he removed, withdrew, or retired to a distance,]
is from الحَاشِيَةُ; like تَنَحَّى from النَّاحِيَةُ: (TA:)
and [↓ تحاشى has a similar meaning:] you say,
تَحَاشَيْتُ مِنْ كَذَا I kept aloof from, shunned, or
removed myself far from, such a thing; from
الحَشَا [or الحَشَى] meaning النَّاحِيَةُ. (Har p. 194.)
―
-b2-  And تحشّى مِنْهُ; (IAar, K;) and مِنْهُ ↓ حاشى,
(Har p. 294,) inf. n. مُحَاشَاةٌ; (KL;) He abstained, or refrained, (IAar, K, KL, Har,) from
him, (IAar, K, Har,) or it, (IAar, KL,) through
disdain and pride; or he disdained, or scorned,
or was ashamed of, him, or it. (IAar, K, Har.)
―
-b3-  And لَا يَتَحَشَّى, (El-Báhilee, TA,) and لا
↓ يُحَاشِى, (Har p. 294,) He will not care, mind,
heed, or regard. (El-Báhilee, Har, TA.)
