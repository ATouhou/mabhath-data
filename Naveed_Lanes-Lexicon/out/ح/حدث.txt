حَدَثَ, (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.
حَدُثَ, (Mgh,
Msb,) inf. n. حُدُوثٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and حَدَاثَةٌ,
(A, K,) It was new, or recent; contr. of قَدُمَ:
(S, * A, K:) it (a thing) came into existence;
began to be; had a beginning; began, or originated; existed newly, for the first time, not
having been before: (S, Mgh, Msb, TA:) but
when mentioned with قَدُمَ, it is written حَدُثَ,
with damm to the د, (S, Mgh, K,) as in the
saying, أَخَذَنِى مَا قَدُمَ وَمَاحَدُثَ, (S,) or أَخَذَهُ
الخ, (A, Mgh,) meaning Old and new anxieties
and thoughts [came into my mind, or his mind,
or overcame me, or him]; (TA;) or old and new
griefs or sorrows; (Mgh;) the former saying
occurring in a trad.: (TA:) the verb is not thus
in any other case [in this sense]. (S.) You say,
حَدَثَ بِهِ عَيْبٌ A vice, or fault, or the like, originated in him, or it, not having been before.
(Msb.) And حَدَثَ أَمْرٌ An affair, or event,
originated: (Mgh:) or happened, or came to pass.
(S.) حُدُوثٌ is of two kinds: حُدُوثٌ زَمَانِىٌّ,
which is A thing's being preceded by non-existence: and حُدُوثٌ ذَاتِىٌّ, which is a thing's being
dependent upon another for its existence. (KT.)
―
-b2-  حَدَاثَةٌ and حُدُوثَةٌ, [as inf. ns. of which the
verb, if they have one, is, accord. to analogy,
حَدُثَ,] relating to a man, signify The being
young; or [as simple substs.] youthfulness.
(ISd, K.)
2
حدّثهُ [He told him, or related to him,
something; he discoursed to him, or talked to
him: see also 5]. You say, حدّثهُ الحَدِيثَ, (L,)
and حدّثهُ بِهِ, (A, * L,) inf. n. تَحْدِيثٌ, a word of
well-known meaning, (S,) He told him, or related
to him, the story, or narrative, or tradition. (L.)
[And حدّث He related traditions of Mohammad:
and حدّث عن فُلَانٍ he related such traditions
heard, or learned, from such a one: the verb in
this sense being an Islámee term.] ―
-b2-  [Hence,]
تَرِكْتُ البِلَادَ تُحَدِّثُ (assumed tropical:)  I left the countries, or
towns, resounding with a buzzing, or confused
noise. (Th, ISd.)
3
حادث سَيْفَهُ, (TA,) inf. n. مُحَادَثَةٌ, (S, K,)
He polished his sword; (S, * K, * TA;) [as though
he made it new by doing so;] as also ↓ احدثهُ,
(TA,) inf. n. إِحْدَاثٌ. (K.) ―
-b2-  Hence, حَادِثُوا هٰذِهِ
القُلُوبَ بِذِكْرِ اللّٰهِ فَإِنَّهَا سَرِيعَةُ الدُّثُورِ (assumed tropical:)  Polish and
cleanse ye these hearts by the remembrance of
God, like as the sword is polished: [for they
quickly become sullied:] a trad. of El-Hasan.
(TA.)
-A2-  مُحَادَثَةٌ and ↓ تَحَادُثٌ, words of wellknown meaning, (S,) are syn.: (K:) [but the
former generally relates to two persons: the
latter, to more than two:] you say, حادث صَاحِبَهُ
[He talked, or conversed in words, with his companion]: (A:) and حادثوا and ↓ تحادثوا [They
talked, or conversed in words, together, or one
with another]. (TK.)
4
احدثهُ (S, A, Msb, TA) and ↓ استحدثهُ (A)
He (God, S, or a man, Msb) brought it into existence, caused it to be, made it, produced it, effected
it, or did it, newly, for the first time, it not having
been before; began it, or originated it; invented
it; innovated it. (S, Msb, TA.) [Hence,] احدث
أَمْرَا [He brought to pass an event]. (Kur lxv. 1.)
And احدث حَدَثًا He originated an innovation
[see حَدَثٌ]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  See also 3. ―

(S, L, Msb, K,) inf. n. إِحْدَاثٌ, (Msb,) from
الحَدَثُ, (S,) (assumed tropical:)  He voided his ordure; or broke

in like manner one says of a woman [احدثت].
(TA.)
5
تحدّث [He talked; conversed in words;
told, or related, stories, or narratives]. (S.) And
تحدّث بِهِ [He talked of it; told it; related it];
(S, A, Msb, K;) namely, a حَدِيث, (Msb,) or
what is termed أُحْدُوثَة. (S, K.) And يَتَحَدَّثُ
إِلَى النِّسَآءِ [He talks to women]. (S, A. *) [See
also 2.] ―
-b2-  It is said in a trad., يَبْعَثُ اللّٰهُ السَّحَابَ
فَيَضْحَكُ أَحْسَنَ الضَّحِكِ وَيَتَحَدَّثُ أَحْسَنَ الحَدِيثِ
(tropical:)  [God shall send the clouds, and they shall laugh
with the best laughing, and talk with the best
talking]: the talking here mentioned, says IAth,
is said to mean thundering; and the laughing,
lightning; thundering being likened to talking
because it announces rain, and its near coming:
or by laughing may be meant the smiling of the
earth, and the appearing of the flowers or blossome; and by talking, the talking of men in
describing and mentioning the plants or herbage:
this figure of speech is termed مَجَازٌ تَعْلِيقِىٌّ, and
is one of the most approved kinds of مجاز. (TA.)

تَحَاْدَثَ see 3, in two places.

إِسْتَحْدَثَ see 4. ―
-b2-  You say also, استحدث خَبَرًا He
found new tidings or information: (S:) or he
gained, or acquired, tidings or information. (A.)
رَجُلٌ حِدْثٌ and ↓ حَدُثٌ and ↓ حَدِثٌ and ↓ حِدِّيثٌ
(K) and ↓ مُحَدِّثٌ (L) A man of many stories or
narratives, (L, K,) and who relates them well: (L:)
or ↓ رَجُلٌ حَدُثٌ and ↓ حَدِثٌ signify a man who
relates stories, or narratives, well: and رَجُلٌ
↓ حِدِّيثٌ signifies a man of many stories or narratives; (S, A, El-Wá'ee;) but is used by the
vulgar to signify a man who relates stories, or
narratives, well. (El-Wá'ee, TA.) And you say
رَجُلٌ حِدْثُ مُلُوكٍ A man who is a companion of
kings in talk (S, A, K) and in their nocturnal
conversations: (S:) and حِدْثُ نِسَآءٍ one who talks
to women; (S, A;) or who talks with women.
(Az, TA in art. تبع.) And ↓ هُوَ حِدِّيثُهُ [He is
his story-teller]. (A.)
حَدَثٌ A novelty, or new thing; an innovation;
a thing not known before: and particularly relating to El-Islám [i. e. to matters of religious
doctrine or practice or the like]: (Mgh:) [and
so ↓ أَمْرٌ مُحْدَثٌ; for] مُحْدَثَاتُ الأُمُورِ (pl. of
مُحْدَثٌ, TA) signifies innovations of people of
erroneous opinions, (Msb, TA,) inconsistent with
the doctrines, or practices, of the just of preceding times: or what is not known in revealed
scripture, nor in the Sunneh, nor in the general
conventional tenets of the doctors of the law:
and حَدَثٌ, [in like manner,] an innovation that
is disapproved, not agreeable with custom, or
usage, and not known in the Sunneh. (TA.)
↓ آوَى مُحْدَثًا, occurring in a trad., means He
entertained an innovation; [i. e. he embraced,
or held, it;] or he was content, or pleased, with
it; or he bore it patiently: or, as some say, it
is ↓ آوَى مُحْدِثًا, meaning he entertained, or harboured in his dwelling, a criminal, or an offender,
and protected him from retaliation. (TA.) ―
-b2-
Also i. q. ↓ حَادِثَةٌ and ↓ حَدَثَانٌ [in some copies
of the S ↓ حِدْثَان] and ↓ حُدْثَى [signifying An
accident, an event, a hap, or a casualty: and
generally an evil accident or event, a mishap, a
misfortune, a disaster, a calamity, or an affliction]: (S:) [the most common of these words
is ↓ حَادِثَةٌ; and its pl., حَوَادِثُ, is more common
than the sing.:] the pl. of حَدَثٌ is أَحْدَاثٌ.
(TA.) أَحْدَاثُ الدَّهْرِ and ↓ حَوَادِثُهُ (A, K) and
↓ حِدْثَانُهُ, (K,) or, as is said by Fr and others,
this last is ↓ حَدَثَانُهُ, (TA,) signify The accidents,
or casualties, of time or fortune; or the evil
accidents, or calamities, of time or fortune. (A,
K.) ↓ حَوَادِثُ occurs used as a sing., said to be
put by poetic license for ↓ حَدَثَانٌ: and this
latter is also used [as a pl.] for حَوَادِثُ: so say
Az and AAF: and it is said to be a noun in the
sense of حَوَادِثُ الدَّهْرِ and نَوَائِبُ الدَّهْرِ: accord.
to Fr, the Arabs say, [using it as a pl.,] أَهْلَكَتْنَا
الحَدَثَانُ [The accidents, or evil accidents, of
time, or fortune, destroyed us]: some say
الحَدَثَانِ, making it dual of حَدَثٌ, and meaning
thereby the night and day; like as they say [in
the same sense] الجَدِيدَانِ and المَلَوَانِ &c. (TA.)
―
-b3-  [Hence] حَدَثٌ is a term applied by Sb to
The مَصْدَر [or infinitive noun]; because all مصادِر
are [significant of] accidents [considered as subsisting in, or proceding from, agents]: and the
pl. which he assigns to it in this sense is أَحْدَاثٌ.
(TA.) ―
-b4-  (assumed tropical:)  The voiding of ordure; or the breaking of wind; syn. إِبْدَآءٌ: (K:) or legal impurity
that forbids, or prevents, one's performing prayer
&c.: (KT:) or a state annulling legal purity:
pl. أَحْدَاثٌ. (Msb.) [See 4.] ―
-b5-  I. q. وَلِىٌّ (assumed tropical:)  [The
rain following that called the وَسْمِىّ]: (L:) or
الأَحْدَاثُ [pl. of الحَدَثُ] signifies the rains of
the commencement, or first part, of the year.
(K.) ―
-b6-  Young, applied to a man, (A, * L, Msb, *)
and to a horse or an ass or the like, and a camel,
and, accord. to IAar, to a mountain-goat: (L:)
pl. أَحْدَاثٌ (A, L, Msb,) and حُدْثَانٌ. (L.) You
say رَجُلٌ حَدَثٌ, (Th, S, L, &c.,) and ↓ حَدِيثُ
السِّنِّ, (Th, S, A, Msb, K,) and حَدَثُ السِّنّ, (IDrd,
K, [but this is by some disallowed, as will be
seen below,]) A young man: (S, L, Msb, K:)
and in the pl. sense you say غِلْمَانٌ أَحْدَاثٌ and
حُدْثَانٌ [pls. of حَدَثٌ], (S,) and رِجَالٌ أَحْدَاثُ
السِّنِّ and حُدْثَانُ السِّنِّ, [or these, as is implied
above, are not allowable,] and حُدَثَآءُ السِّنِّ [pl.
of ↓ حَدِيثٌ]. (ISd, TA.) J says, [in the S,]
if you mention the سِنّ, you say السِّنِّ ↓ حَدِيثُ
[lit. Young of tooth]: and IDrst says, the vulgar
say, هُوَ حَدَثُ السِّنِّ, like as you say حديث السِّنِّ;
but it is a mistake; for حَدَثٌ is an epithet applied
to the man himself, and is originally an inf. n.;
one should not apply it as an epithet to the سِنّ
nor to the ضِرْس nor to the ناب; but ↓ حَدِيثٌ is
an epithet applied to anything recent. (TA.)
حَدُثٌ: see حَدَثٌ, first sentence; each in
two places.
حَدِثٌ: see حَدَثٌ, first sentence; each in
two places.
حَدِثٌ: see حَدَثٌ.
حُدْثَى: see what next follows.
حِدْثَانٌ The first, or beginning, or commencement, of a state, or a case, or an affair; (S, A,
Mgh, K;) as also ↓ حَدَاثَةٌ: (S, Mgh, K:)
and its freshness; which is also a signification
of both these words. (S, Mgh.) So in the saying,
اِفْعَلْ ذٰلِكَ الأَمْرَ بِحِدْثَانِهِ and ↓ بِحَدَاثَتِهِ [Do thou
that thing while it is in its first and fresh state].
(S, Mgh. *) One says also, أَتَيْتُهُ فِى حِدْثَانِ شَبَابِهِ
and شبابه ↓ حِدْثَى and شبابه ↓ حَدِيثِ (assumed tropical:)  I came
to him in the beginning, or first period, of his
youth. (Aboo-'Amr Esh-Sheybánee, TA.) And
it is said in a trad., addressed to 'Áïsheh, لَوْلَا
حِدْثَانُ قَوْمِكِ بِالكُفْرِ لَهَدَمْتُ الكَعْبَةَ وَبَنَيْتُهَا, (Mgh, *
TA,) or, as some relate it, قومك ↓ حَدَاثَةُ, which
means the same, (Mgh,) i. e. Were it not for the
shortness of the period that has elapsed since thy
people were in the state of infidelity, I would
pull down the Kaabeh, and build it [anew]. (TA.)

in three places.
حَدِيثٌ New, recent; (K;) contr. of قَدِيمٌ:
(S:) having, or having had, a beginning; existing newly, for the first time, not having been
before; as also ↓ حَادِثٌ: (Msb:) brought into
existence, caused to be, made, produced, or done,
newly, for the first time, not having been before;
begun, or originated; invented; innovated; as
also ↓ مُحْدَثٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  See حَدَثٌ, last two
sentences, in four places. And see حِدْثَانٌ. You
say also, هُوَ حَدِيثُ عَهْدٍ بِالإِسْلَامِ He is, or was,
recently become a Muslim. (Msb.) And حَدِيثُو
عَهْدٍ بِكُفْرِهِمْ, (TA,) or بِالجَاهِلِيَّةِ, or حَدِيثٌ عَهْدُهُمْ,
(Mgh,) Men lately in their state of infidelity [or
in the state of paganism or ignorance]; who have
but recently ceased to be in their state of infidelity
[&c.]. (TA.)
-A2-  Also i. q. خَبَرٌ [Information; a
piece of information; intelligence; an announcement; news, or tidings; a piece of news; an
account; a narration, or narrative; a story;
&c.]; (S, K;) employed to signify little and
much; (S;) and ↓ حِدِّيثَى signifies the same:
(K:) or a thing, or matter, that is talked of,
told, or narrated, and transmitted: (Msb:) [and
talk, or discourse:] and [in like manner] ↓ أُحْدُوثَةٌ
signifies a thing that is talked of, told, or narrated: (S, K:) or this last signifies a wonderful
thing: (IB, TA:) it has been asserted, says
MF, that there is no difference between احدوثة
and حديث in usage, and in denoting what is
good and what is evil; in contradiction to such
as say that the former peculiarly signifies that
[kind of story] in which there is no profit nor
any truth; such as amatory stories, and the like
fictions of the Arabs: Fr asserts it to signify
peculiarly a laughable and an absurd story; differing from حديث: and Ibn-Hishám El-Lakhmee,
in his Expos of the Fs, says that it is only used
to denote what is bad, or evil: but Lb replies
against him, in his Expos., that it is sometimes
used to denote what is good; as in a saying
mentioned by Yaakoob, which see below: (TA:)
the pl. of حَدِيثٌ is أَحَادِيثُ, contr. to analogy,
(S, K,) said by Fr to be pl. of ↓ أُحْدُوثَةٌ, and
then used as pl. of حديث, (S,) but IB says
that this is not the case; (TA;) and حِدْثَانٌ and
حُدْثَانٌ are also pls. of حديث, (K, TA,) sometimes occurring; the latter, rare. (TA.) You
say, سَمِعْتُ حَدِيثًا حَسَنًا (TA) and حَسَنَةً ↓ حِدِّيثَى
(S, A, * TA) [I heard a good story or narrative
&c.]; both meaning the same. (TA.) And اِنْتَشَرَ
حَسَنَةٌ ↓ لَهُ فِى النَّاسِ أُحْدُوثَةٌ [A good story of
him became spread abroad among the people]:
a saying mentioned by Yaakoob in his “ Isláh. ”
(TA.) And مَلِيحَةٌ ↓ أثحْدُوثَةٌ [A pretty story],
and أَحَادِيثُ مِلَاحٌ [pretty stories]. (A.) And
↓ قَدْ صَارَ فُلَانٌ أَحْدُوثَةً [(tropical:)  Such a one has become
the subject of a story, or of a wonderful story:
and in like manner, as is said in the A,
صَارُوا أَحَادِيثَ: there said to be tropical]. (IB,
TA.) ―
-b2-  Hence the حَدِيث of the Apostle of
God: (Msb:) [i. e.] حَدِيثٌ also signifies A
narration of a مُحَدِّث: (L:) [meaning حَدِيثٌ
نَبَوِىٌّ, i. e. a tradition, or narration, relating,
or describing, a saying or an action &c. of Mo-
hammad:] this word and خَبَرٌ both signify a
tradition that is traced up to Mohammad, or
to a Sahábee, or to a Tábi'ee: (TA in art. رقأ:)
or حديث is applied to what comes from the
Prophet: خَبَرٌ, to what comes from another than
the Prophet; or from him or another: and أَثَرٌ
to what comes from a Companion of the Prophet;
but it may also be applied to a saying of the
Prophet: (Kull p. 152:) the word in this sense,
i. e. the حديث of the Prophet, has for its pl.
only أَحَادِيثُ; and therefore Sb mentions it in
the category of those words which have pls.
anomalously formed; such as عَرُوضٌ, pl. أَعَارِيضُ;
and بَاطِلٌ, pl. أَبَاطِيلُ. (TA.) [الحَدِيثَ written
at the end of a quotation of a part of a trad. is for
اِقْرَأِ الحَدِيثَ Read the tradition.] ―
-b3-  حَدِيثٌ قُدْسِىٌّ
[A holy tradition or narration] means what
God has told to his prophet by inspiration, or
by a dream, or in sleep, and the prophet has
told in his own phraseology: the Kur-án is
esteemed above this, because [it is held that]
its words also were revealed: (KT:) that of
which the words are from the apostle, but the
meaning is from God, by inspiration, or by a
dream, or in sleep. (Kull p. 288.)

put, and who tells it conjecturally and with
sagacity; as though he were told a thing, and
said it: occurring in a trad.: (TA:) such was
'Omar. (A, TA.)
مُحَدِّثٌ A teller, or relater, of stories, narratives, or traditions: [and particularly a relater
of, or one skilled in, the traditions of Mohammad:] ↓ حُدَّاثٌ in the sense of مُحَدِّثُونَ, signifying a company of men telling, or relating, stories
&c., is an anomalous pl., formed by assigning it
to the same predicament as words of similar
meaning, of which سُمَّارٌ, pl. of سَامِرٌ, is an ex.
(L.) See also حِدْثٌ.
أَرْضٌ مَحْدُوثَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  Land upon which the rain
called حَدَث has fallen. (L.)
