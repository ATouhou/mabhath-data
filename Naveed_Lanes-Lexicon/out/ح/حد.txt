prescribed, or appointed, to be inflicted upon

to do; (T, Mgh, L;) as the حدّ of the thief,
which is the cutting off of his right hand for
stealing a thing of the value of a quarter of a
deenár or more; and that of the fornicator or
fornicatress, which is flogging with a hundred
stripes and banishment for a year; and that of
the adulterer or adulteress, which is stoning; and
that of the person who [falsely] charges an honest
or a married woman with adultery, which is
flogging with eighty stripes [as is also that of
the person who has committed the crime of
drunkenness]: (T, L:) the first kind are called
حدود because they denote limits which God has
forbidden to transgress: the second, because they
prevent one's committing again those acts for
which they are appointed as punishments; (T,
Mgh, L;) or because the limits thereof are determined: (Mgh:) the latter kind of حدّ is also
explained as being that [castigation, or punishment,] which prevents the criminal from returning to his crime, and prevents others from committing his crime. (L, K. *) لَوْ رَأَيْتَهُ عَلَى حَدٍّ,
