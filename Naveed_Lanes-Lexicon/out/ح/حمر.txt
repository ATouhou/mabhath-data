IAar, in water [when muddy]: and so ↓ يَحْمُورٌ:
(K:) fem. of the former حَمْرَآءُ: (Msb:) pl. حُمْرٌ
and حُمْرَانٌ: (K:) or when it means dyed with
the colour termed حُمْرَةٌ, the pl. is حُمْرٌ (S, Msb)
and حُمْرَانٌ; for you say ثِيَابٌ حُمْرٌ and حُمْرَانٌ
[red garments]: (TA:) but if you apply it as an
epithet to a man, [in which case it has other
meanings than those explained above, as will be
shown in what follows,] the pl. is أَحَامِرُ (S)
and حُمْرٌ: (TA:) or if it means a thing having
the colour termed حُمْرَةٌ, the pl. is أَحَامِرُ, because,
in this case, it is a subst., not an epithet. (Msb.)
↓ أَحْمَرِىٌّ also signifies the same as أَحْمَرُ: (Ham
p. 379:) or, as some say, it has an intensive

حَمْرَآء is the most able to endure the summer
midday-heat; and the وَرْقَآء, to endure nightjourneying; and that the صَهْبَآء is the most notable
and the most beautiful to look at: so said Aboo-Nasr En-Na'ámee: and the Arabs say that the
best of camels are the حُمْر and the صُهْب. (TA.)

excellent, of camels: and is proverbially applied to
anything highly prized, precious, valuable, or
excellent. (Mgh, Msb.) ―

(AA, Sh, Az,) White (AA, Sh, Az, K) in complexion; (Az;) because أَبْيَضُ might be considered as of evil omen [implying the meaning

the latter epithet, applied to a man, was only
used by the Arabs as signifying “ pure,” or “ free
from faults: ” but they sometimes used this latter
epithet in the sense of “ white in complexion,”
applied to a man &c.: (IAth:) fem., in the same
sense, حَمْرَآءُ: the dim. of which, ↓ حُمَيْرَآءُ, occurs
in a trad., applied to 'Áïsheh. (K, * TA.) So,
accord. to some, in the trad., بُعِثْتُ إِلَى الأَحْمَرِ
وَالأَسْوَدِ, (TA,) i. e. I have been sent to the white
and the black; because these two epithets comprise all mankind: (Az, TA:) [therefore, by the
former we should understand the white and the
red races; and by the latter, the negroes: but
some hold that by the former are meant the
foreigners, and] by the latter are meant the
Arabs. (TA.) One says also, [when speaking of
Arabs and more northern races,] أَتَانِى كُلُّ أَسْوَدَ
مِنْهُمْ وَأَحْمَرَ, meaning Every Arab of them, and
foreigner, came to me: and one should not say,
in this sense, أَبْيَضَ. (AA, As, S.) الحَمْرَآءُ, also,
is applied to The foreigners (العَجَمُ) [collectively];
(S, A, K;) because a reddish white is the prevailing hue of their complexion: (S:) or the
Persians and Greeks: or those foreigners mostly
characterized by whiteness of complexion; as the
Greeks and Persians. (TA.) You say, لَيْسَ فِى
الحَمْرَآءِ مِثْلُهُ There is not among the foreigners
(العَجَم) the like of him. (A.) And accord. to
some, الأَحْمَرُ وَالأَبْيَضُ means The Arabs and the
foreigners. (TA.) الحَمْرَآءُ [so in the TA, but
correctly أَبْنَآءُ الحَمْرَآءِ,] is an appellation applied to
Emancipated slaves: and اِبْنُ حَمْرَآءِ العِجَانِ,
meaning Son of the female slave, is an appellation
used in reviling and blaming. (TA.) ―

We are of the people of dates and water, not of
flesh-meat and wine: (A:) or the beverage called

(tropical:)  violent death: (S, A, L, K:) or death in which
the sight of the man becomes dim by reason of
terror, so that the world appears red and black
before his eyes: (A 'Obeyd:) or it may mean
(assumed tropical:)  recent, fresh, death; from the phrase next
following. (As.) ―
-b9-  وَطْأَةٌ حَمْرَآءُ (tropical:)  A new, or recent,
footstep, or footprint: opposed to دَهْمَآءُ. (As,
S, A.) ―
-b10-  سَنَةٌ حَمْرَآءُ (tropical:)  A severe year; (S, K;)
because it is a mean between the سَوْدَآء and the
بَيْضآء: or a year of severe drought; because, in such

when الجَبْهَةُ [the tenth Mansion of the Moon
(see مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ in art. نزل)] breaks its promise
[of bringing rain], the year is such as is thus
called. (AHn.) ―
