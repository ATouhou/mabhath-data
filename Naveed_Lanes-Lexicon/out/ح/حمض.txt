حمّض, inf. n. تَحْمِيضٌ: see 1, first signification.
-A2-  [It seems to be also syn. with تحمّض,
q. v.: for, ―
-b2- ] said of a man, it signifies أَتَى
المَرْأَةَ فِى دُبُرِهَا, as though he shifted from the
better of the two places to the worse thereof,
by reason of preposterous desire: (TA:) as also
↓ احمض: opposed to أَخَلَّ [q. v.]. (TA in art.
خل.) ―
-b3-  تَحْمِيضٌ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  تَفْخِيذٌ (S, TA)
in جِمَاع. (TA.) ―

little of a thing. (S, K.) You say, حَمَّضَ لَنَا

TS, K.) ―
-b4-  [And hence,] احمض القَوْمُ (tropical:)  The
people, or company of men, launched into, or
entered upon, cheering discourse. (A, TA.) I'Ab
used to say to his companions, أَحْمِضُوا (tropical:)  [Launch
ye forth, or enter upon, cheering discourse]; (A,
TA;) whereupon they would begin to recite
poetry, and to relate the memorable conflicts of
the Arabs; (A;) because they then entered into
traditions and stories of the Arabs, being weary
of the interpretation of the Kur-án, [like camels
betaking themselves to the pasture termed حَيْض
when weary of that termed خُلَّة.] (TA.) [And
in like manner,] إِحْمَاضٌ also means (assumed tropical:)  The changing
from seriousness to jesting or joking. (Har
p. 10.) ―
-b5-  See also 2. [And see 5.]

him from it [to another thing]. (TA.)

تحمّض [app. signifies, in its primary acceptation, He (a camel) betook himself to the pasture
termed حَمْض after eating for a time of that
termed خُلَّة. (See also 1 and 4 and 2.) ―
-b2-  And
hence,] (tropical:)  He shifted from one thing to another
thing. (TA.) ―
-b3-  [Hence also,] one says to a
man when he comes threatening, أَنْتَ مُخْتَلَّ
فَتَحَمَّضْ (tropical:)  [Thou art disordered in temper, therefore sooth thyself]: (S, A:) from خُلَّةٌ and
حَمْضٌ. (S.) [See also خُلِّىٌّ, in art. خل.]
حَمْضٌ [a coll. gen. n.] A kind of plant in
which is saltness, (A, Msb,) which camels eat
as though it were fruit, and after which they
drink: (A:) other plants are termed خُلَّة:
(Msb:) or what is salt and bitter, of plants;
(S, K;) such as the رِمْث and the أَثْل and the
طَرْفَآء and the like: (S:) what is sweet is called
خُلَّة: (S, K:) or any kind of plant that is salt,
or sour, rising upon [several] stems, and having
no [single] أَصْل [or stock]: (M [as cited in the
L, but I doubt whether the passage be correctly
transcribed]:) or any salt, or sour, kind of trees;
having a juicy and quivering leaf, which, when
squeezed, bursts forth with water; and having a
pungent, or strong, odour; that cleanses the garment and the hand when they are washed with it;
such as the نَجِيل and the خذْرَاف and the إِخْرِيط
and the رِمْث and the قِضَة and the قُلَّام and the
هَرْم and the حُرْض and the رُغل and the طَرْفَآء
and the like: (Lh:) or any plant that does not
dry up in the رَبِيع [or spring], but endures the
hot season, having in it saltness; when camels eat
it, they drink upon it; and when they do not
find it, they become thin and weak: (Lth, T:)
the Arabs say that the خُلَّة is the bread of camels,
and the حَمْض is their fruit, (S, A, Msb, K, *)
or, as some say, their flesh-meat; (S;) or their
خَبِيص: (TA in art. خل:) and they say that
flesh-meat is the حَمْض of men: (TA:) the n. un.
is with ة: (Mgh:) and the pl. is حُمُوضٌ. (S, K.)
[In Isaiah xxx. 24, the word rendered “ clean ”
in our authorized version is thought by some to
mean “ salt ” or “ sour. ”] ―
-b2-  Hence the saying,
جَاؤُوا مُخِلِّينَ فَلَاقَوْا حَمْضَا
(tropical:)  They came eagerly desiring evil, or mischief,
and found him who cured them of that which
affected them: which is like the saying of
Ru-beh,
وَنُورِدُ المُسْتَوْرِدِينَ حَمْضَا
(tropical:)  And him who cometh to us seeking to do evil,
or mischief, we cure of his disease: for camels,
when they are satiated with خُلَّة, eagerly desire
حَمْض [to cure them of the effect of the former].
(TA. [See also خُلِّىٌّ, in art. خل.]) ―
-b3-  Hence,
also, by way of comparison, حَمْض is applied to
(tropical:)  Evil, and war: and خُلَّة, to ease, or repose;
freedom from trouble or inconvenience, and toil
or fatigue; or tranquillity; and ampleness of circumstances: (T and TA in art. خل:) and the
former, to death: and the latter, to life. (Ham
p. 315.) ―
-b4-  فُؤَادٌ حَمْضٌ and نَفْسٌ حَمْضةٌ mean
(assumed tropical:)  A mind that takes fright at a thing, and shrinks
from it, at first hearing it. (TA.)
حَمْضَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  Eager desire for a thing. (S, K.) It
is said in a trad., الأُذُنُ مَجَّاجَةٌ وَلِلنَّفْسِ حَمْضةٌ;
(S, TA;) and in another, لِلْأُذُنِ مَجَّةٌ وللنفس
حمضة; (TA;) [both meaning the same;] (assumed tropical:)  The
ear is wont to reject what it hears, not retaining
it, when one is exhorted to do a thing, or forbidden to do it, while the mind has eager desire
to hear: (IAth:) or the ear retains not all that
that it hears, while having eager desire for what it
deems elegant, of extraordinary matters of discourse and speech. (Az.) This usage of the word
is taken from the eager desire of camels for حَمْض
when they have become weary of خُلَّة. (S.)
بَعِيرٌ حَمْضِىٌّ, and إِبِلٌ حَمْضِيَّةٌ and حَمَضِيَّةٌ: see
حَامِضٌ: ―
-b2-  and أَرْضٌ حَمْضِيَّةٌ: see حَمِيضةٌ.
حُمُوضةٌ [Acidity; sourness; the quality of
being sharp or biting to the taste; pungency;]
the taste of that which is termed حَامِض. (S, K.)
[See 1.] الحُمُوضةُ is also explained as signifying
That which bites the tongue; as the taste of
vinegar, and of milk such as is termed حَازِر:
which is extr., [if it be meant thereby that the
word is thus used as an epithet to qualify a subst.,
or as an epithet in which the quality of a subst.
is predominant, but I rather think that it is a
loose way of explaining it as an inf. n. used as a
simple subst.,] for [the measure] فُعُولَةٌ does not
belong [save] to inf. ns. (TA: [in which the
word إِلَّا is evidently omitted by an oversight in
transcription, and therefore has been supplied by
me in rendering the passage.])
أَرْضٌ حَمِيضَةٌ Land abounding with حَمْض;
(ISh, K;) as also ↓ ارض مُحْمِضَةٌ; (S;) and
↓ ارض حَمْضِيَّةٌ: (TA:) pl. of the first, أَرَضُونَ
حُمُضٌ, (as in some copies of the K,) or حُمْضٌ:
(as in other copies of the same, and in the TA:)
and حُمُوضٌ [which seems to be another pl. of the
first of these epithets] is explained as signifying
land possessing حَمْض. (TA.)
حُمَّاضٌ [Sorrel; or particularly the rose-flowered
sorrel; more commonly called in the present day
حُمَّيْض;] a certain plant having a red flower;
(S;) a herb, or leguminous plant, of the kind
termed ذُكُور, having a produce, or fruit, red
like blood; (Ham p. 823;) a certain herb (K,
TA) growing in the mountains, of herbs of the
[season called] رَبِيع, (TA,) the leaves of which
are like those of the هِنْدِبَآء, (K, TA,) large and
broad; (TA;) it is acid, (K, TA,) intensely so;
its flower is red, and its leaves are green: (TA:
[in which is here added ويتناوس فى ثمره مثل
حبّ الرمّان, app. for وَيَتَنَوَّسُ الخ; meaning that it
waves much to and fro when blown by the wind,
and describing its fruit as containing what resemble the grains of the pomegranate:]) it is
pleasant to the taste; (K, TA;) and is eaten by
men, but in small quantity: AHn and Aboo-Ziyád say, it grows very tall, and has a wide leaf,
and a red flower, which, when it is near to drying
up, becomes white: and Aboo-Ziyád says, in our
mountain-country it is abundant; and is of two
species; one of these two is acid, [but] pleasant to
the taste; (TA;) and one species thereof is
bitter; (K, TA;) in the lower parts of each,
when they are full grown, is a redness; and the
seeds and leaves of the acid species are used
medicinally: Az says, it is a wild herb, or leguminous plant, that grows in the days of the [season
called] رَبِيع, in the channels of water, and has a
red flower, and is of the herbs, or leguminous plants,
which are termed ذُكُور: IB says, the places of
its growth are the small channels of water, and
the places to which valleys take their courses;
and in it is acidity: sometimes, also, the people
of settled habitations make it to grow in their gardens, and water it and sustain it so that it does
not dry up in the time when the wild herbs, or
leguminous plants, dry up: it is also said in the
Minháj that it is both wild and growing in gardens; that the wild is called سلق, [but this name
is commonly applied to bete,] and in all of this
there is not acidity: the garden-kind resembles
the هندباء, and in this is acidity, and an excessive
viscous moisture: the best is the acid, gardenkind: here ends the quotation from the Minháj:
(TA:) each species, (K, TA,) the bitter and the
pleasant, or the garden-kind and the wild, (TA,)
is good for thirst, and for inflammation arising
from yellow bile; and strengthens the bowels;
and allays heaving of the stomach, and hot palpitation, and tooth-ache; and is good for the black
[or livid] jaundice; (K, * TA;) and, when cooked,
and applied externally, for the leprosy; and for
the ringworm (قُوَبَآء); and for glandular swellings
in the neck, so much so that it is said to do good
to him who has these even when hung upon the
neck: with vinegar, also, it is good for the mange,
or scab; and it is astringent; and puts a stop to
malacia [so I render شَهْوَةالطِّين, lit. “ the longing
for clay ”]: its seeds are cold in the first degree,
and have an astringent property, particularly
when fried: (TA:) they say that if these be hung,
in a purse, upon a woman's left upper arm, she
will not become pregnant as long as they remain
upon her: (K, * TA:) they are also good for the
sting of scorpions; and if some of the seeds be
swallowed before the scorpion's stinging, its stinging will not hurt. (TA.)
-A2-  Also What is in the
interior of the [kind of citron called] أُتْرُجّ:
(A, K:) n. un. with ة: (A:) it is cold and dry
in the third degree; used as a liniment, it removes
freckles and the like, and clears the complexion;
and it suppresses (يَقْمَعُ) the yellow bile; and
gives appetite for food; and is good for hot
palpitation; and made into a beverage, it sweetens
the odour of the mouth; and is good for looseness
arising from yellow bile; and is suitable for
those who are fevered. (TA.) [In the present
day, in Egypt, this name is applied to A species
of citron, itself, with a conical apex, and very
acid pulp.]
حُمَّيْضَى A certain plant: not from حُمُوضَة.
(TA.)
حُمَّاضِيَّةٌ A confection composed of حُمَّاض of
the أُتْرُجّ. (TA.)
حَامِضٌ [Acid; sour; sharp or biting to the taste;
pungent; having a taste like that of vinegar or like
that of sour milk; see حُمُوضةٌ;] (S, Msb, K;) applied
to milk (TA) and other things; (Msb;) and ↓ مُحَمِّضٌ
signifies the same, applied to a grape. (TA.) ―
-b2-
[Hence,] رَجُلٌ حَامِضُ الفُؤَادِ (tropical:)  A man whose heart,
or mind, is altered and bad, (O, K,) فِى الغَضَبِ
in anger. (O.) And فُلَانٌ حَامِضُ الرِّئَتَيْنِ (assumed tropical:)  Such
a one is in a loathing state of mind; syn. مُرُّ
النَّفْسِ. (S.)
-A2-  إِبِلٌ حَامِضَةٌ Camels pasturing
upon حَمْض; (S.) or eating it; (K;) or pastur
ing upon حَمْض after pasturing upon خُلَّة:
(ISk:) pl. حَوَامِضُ: (S, K:) and ↓ إِبِلٌ حَمْضِيَّةٌ
Camels staying among حَمْض; (As, S, K;) as
also ↓ حَمَضِيَّةٌ, contr. to rule: (TA:) and بَعِيرٌ
↓ حَمْضِىٌّ a camel eating حَمْض. (TA.)
مَحْمَضٌ and مُحْمَضٌ, (S, K,) the latter on the
authority of A'Obeyd, (S,) A place in which
camels pasture upon حَمْض. (S, K. *)
أَرْضٌ مُحْمِضَةٌ: see حَمِيضَةٌ.
