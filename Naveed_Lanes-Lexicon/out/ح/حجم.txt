or fear: (K, TA:) or he receded, or drew back,
form it; namely, a thing, or an affair: (Msb:)

perceiving the feel of the bones [or bone] behind
the skin: thus explaining it after the manner of
explaining inf. ns.: and ISd says, I known not
whether it be in his opinion an inf. n. or a simple
subst. (TA.) And Lth says that الحَجْمُ means
One's perceiving the feel of a thing beneath a
garment: [and that] one says, مَسَسْتُ بَطْنَ
الحُبْلَى فَوَجَدْتُ حَجْمَ الصَّبِىِّ فِى بَطْنِهَا [which
plainly means, I felt the belly of the pregnant
woman, and perceived the bulging of the child in
her belly]. (Mgh, TA.) It is said [of a woman's
garment] in a trad., لَا يَصِفُ حَجْمَ عِظَامِهَا [lit.
(tropical:) It does not describe the projecting of her bones]:
meaning, the garment does not stick to her body

حَجَّامٌ A cupper; syn. مَصَّاصٌ [lit. one who is
in the habit of sucking]; (K;) one who performs
the operation termed حَجْمٌ; (S, Mgh;) one who
scarifies [and draws blood with the مِحْجَمَة];
(Msb;) as also ↓ حَاجِمٌ; (S, Msb, K;) but the
former is an intensive epithet [denoting frequency
or habit]: (Msb:) so called because he sucks the
mouth of the مِحْجَمَة. (Az, TA.) Hence the
prov. أَفْرَغُ مِنْ حَجَّامِ سَابَاطَ [More unoccupied
than the cupper of Sábát (the name of a place)]:
