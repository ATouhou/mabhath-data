انحاش عَنْهُ He took fright, and fled from

added, that this verb is quasi-pass. of الحَوْشُ in
the sense of النِّفَارُ; but this seems to indicate that
a copyist has written النفار by mistake for الإِنْفَارُ,
which is a syn. of the inf. n. of 1 in a sense explained above: so that انحاش signifies He
became scared, or the like.] Hr mentions this
verb in art. حيش; but it belongs to the present
