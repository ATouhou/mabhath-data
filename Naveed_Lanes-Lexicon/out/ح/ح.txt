حalphabetical letter
ح
The sixth letter of the alphabet: called حَآءٌ [and
حَا (respecting which latter see the letter ب).
It is one of the letters termed مَهْمُوسَة, or nonvocal, i. e. pronounced with the breath only,
without the voice; and of those termed حَلْقِيَّة
i. e. faucial, or guttural, for] the place of its
utterance is in the fauces; and were it not for
a hoarse aspiration with which it is pronounced,
it would resemble ع: next after it [with respect
to the place of utterance] is ه: [ع having the
lowest place of utterance; then ح; and then ه:]
and ح and ه are never consociated in any uncompounded word of the which the letters are all
radicals, because of the mutual nearness of their
places of utterance: they occur together in حَيَّهَلْ;
but this is only a compound word in the classical
language; and as the name of a certain kind of
tree it is a post-classical word. (Kh, L.)
-A2-  [It
is often put for حِينَئِذٍ.
-A3-  As a numeral, it denotes
Eight.]
