(TA:) [see 1, first sentence:] pl. [of the first]
حُرُورٌ and ↓ أَحَارِرُ; (K;) the latter anomalous,
both as to its measure and in the non-incorporation of the first ر into the second: it is mentioned on the authority of AZ and others; but
IDrd doubts its correctness; and the author of

Msb, K:) pl. masc. أَحْرَارٌ (Msb, K) and حِرَارٌ;

inf. n. as well as a pl., as others say: (MF:)
pl. fem. حَرَائِرُ, (Msb, K,) contr. to analogy, and,
as Suh says, the only instance of the kind except
شَجَرٌ مَرَائِرُ as pl. of شَجَرَةٌ مُرَّةٌ; for the [regular]
pl. of فُعْلَةٌ is فْعَلٌ; but حُرَّةٌ has this form of pl.
because it is syn. with كَرِيمَةٌ and عَقِيلَةٌ [as will
be seen in what follows]; and مُرَّةٌ, because it
means خَبِيثَةُ الطَّعْمِ. (Msb.) Omar said to the
women who used to go forth to the mosque,
لَأَرُدَّنَّكْنَّ حَرَائِرَ [lit. I will assuredly make you to
become free women]; meaning I will assuredly
make you to keep to the houses: for the curtain is

fem. حُرَّةٌ; (S, Mgh, K;) applied to a woman;
(TA;) and to a she-camel: (S:) and so the
masc. applied to a horse. (K, TA.) [Hence,]
بَاتَتْ بِلَيْلَةِ حُرَّةٍ (tropical:)  [She passed a virgin's night] is
said of her whose husband has not been able to
devirginate her (S, A, K) in the night when she
has been first brought to him: (TA:) because
the حُرَّة is modest and repugnant: (Har p. 418:)
in the contr. case one says, بِلَيْلَةِ شَيْبَآءَ: (S, L:)
and one says also بِلَيْلَةٍ حُرَّةٍ; and بِلَيْلَةٍ شَيْبَآءَ.
(TA.) [And hence,] لَيْلَةُ حُرَّة and لَيْلَةٌ حُرَّةٌ signify also (assumed tropical:)  The first night of the [lunar] month:

(K, TA:) or earth, or clay, in which is no sand:
(S, A:) and sand in which is no earth or clay:
(S:) or sand that has good herbage: (A:) you
say رَمْلَةٌ حُرَّةٌ; (S, A;) and the pl. is حَرَائِرُ: (S:)
or sand in which is no mixture of any other
thing: (Msb: [accord. to which, this is the
primary meaning of the word, whence the meaning of “ free,” i. e. the “ contr. of عَبْدٌ: ” but
accord. to the A and TA, it is tropical:]) and
أَرْضٌ حُرَّةٌ (tropical:)  land in which is no salt earth: (A:)

or leguminous plants, that are eaten without being

such as are slender and succulent; and ذُكُورُ
البُقُولِ means “ such as are thick and rough: ”
(AHeyth:) or the former are such as are slender
and soft; and the latter, “such as are hard and
thick: ” (TA in art. عشب:) or the former are
such as are slender and sweet; and the latter,
“ such as are thick, and inclining to bitterness: ”
(TA in art. ذكر:) or the former are such as are
rough; and these are three, namely, النَّفَلُ and
الحُرْبُثُ and القَفْعَآءُ: or الحُرُّ is applied to a plant
of the kind called النَّجِيل, growing in salt grounds.
(TA.) ―
-b10-  حُرُّ الوَجْهِ (tropical:)  What appears of the face:
(K, TA:) or what appears of the elevated part
of the cheek; (S;) [i. e.] the ball, or most prominent place, of the cheek; (W p. 28;) and

turtle-doves of which the female is called قُمْرِيَّة
(see قُمْرِىٌّ)]: (S, Msb, K:) Homeyd Ibn-Thowr
says,
وَمَا هَاجَ هٰذَا الشَّوْقَ إِلَّا حَمَامَةٌ
دَعَتْ سَاقَ حُرٍّ تَرْحَةً وَتَرَنُّمَا
[And nothing excited this desire but a pigeon (see
حَمَامٌ) that called ساق حرّ, sorrowing and warbling]: or, accord. to IJ, the right reading is
دَعَتْ سَاقَ حُرٍّ فِى حَمَامٍ تَرَنُّمَا
[that called ساق حرّ among other pigeons, warbling]: but some say that الساق is the pigeon; and
حرّ, its young one: or ساق حرّ is the cry of the
قمارىّ, and is an onomatopœia: accord. to Aboo-
'Adnán, it is ↓ ساق حَرّ, and means the warbling
of the pigeon: and Sakhr El-Gheí makes it a
compound, and indecl.; using the phrase, تُنَادِى
سَاقَ حُرَّ [she calls ساق حرّ]: on which IJ observes, As says, ساق حرّ is thought to mean the
young one of the bird; but it is her cry: and he
(IJ) adds, the fact that the poet [Sakhr] does not
make it decl. is an evidence of the correctness of
the assertion of As; for, were it decl., he would
have said سَاقَ حُرٍّ if it consisted of two nouns
whereof the former was prefixed to the other so
as to govern it in the gen. case, or ساق حُرًّا if it
were a compound; as it is indeterminate: and its
being made decl. by Homeyd does not show it to
be not significant of a sound; for sometimes an
expression significant of a sound consists of two
nouns whereof the former is prefixed to the latter
so as to govern it in the gen. case, like خَازُ بَازٍ.
