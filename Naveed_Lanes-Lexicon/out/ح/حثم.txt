ii. 920, المُحْثٰى:)] said on the occasion of wishing to be in the condition of him of whom the
honourable treatment that he receives is concealed,
and of whom the contemptuous treatment that
he receives is made apparent: originating from
the fact that a man was sitting with a woman,
and a man attached to her approached; so, when
she saw him, she threw dust in his [the former's]
face, to show this man who was sitting with her
that he should not draw near to her, lest their
case should become known. (TA.)
