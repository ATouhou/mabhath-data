أمُّ حُبَيْنٍ A certain small beast or reptile, (S,
K,) well known; (K;) the عِظَايَة: (Mgh:) or
a species of the [kind of lizards termed] عِظَآء;
of stinking odour: (Msb:) so called because of
the largeness of its belly; from أَحْبَنُ [q. v.]:
also called ↓ حُبَيْنَةُ; (S, Msb, K;) and sometimes
the article ال is prefixed to it, (S, Msb, K,) so
that it is called أُمُّ الحُبَيْنِ, (S, Msb,) by poetic
license: (TA:) it is of the form of the حِرْبَآء [or
chameleon], broad in the breast, and large in the
belly: (TA:) or, accord. to some, (TA,) it is
the female of the حِرْبَآء: (S and Msb and K in
art. حرب, and TA in the present art.:) accord.
to Az, it is a small reptile resembling the [kind of
lizard called] ضَبّ: (Msb:) or, as some say, a
certain reptile of the size of a man's hand: or,
accord. to Ibn-Ziyád, a dust-coloured reptile,
with four legs, and of the size of a frog that is
not large; and when the children hunt it, they
say to it,
انَّ الأَمِيرَ نَاظِرٌ إِلَيْكِ  أُمَّ الحُبَيْنِ اُنْشُرِى بُرْدَيْكِ
[Umm-el-Hobeyn, spread forth thy two wings:
verily the commander is looking at thee]: they
hunt it until fatigue overcomes it, when it stops,
standing upright upon its two kind legs, and
spreads forth two wings that it has, of the same
dust-colour; and when they hunt it further, it
spreads forth wings that were beneath those two
wings, than which nothing more beautiful in
colour has been seen, yellow and red and green
and white, in streaks, one above another, very
many; and when it has done this, they leave it:
no offspring of it is found; nor any genital
organ: (TA:) the appellation أُمُّ حُبَيْنٍ is determinate, like اِبْنُ عِرْسٍ and اِبْنُ آوَى; (S, Msb;)
and [so is ↓ حُبَيْنَةُ,] like أُسَامَةُ; (S;) but determinate as a generic appellation: (S, Msb:) the
suppression of the article does not render it indeterminate; which is contr. to rule: (S, K:)
the pl. is أُمُّ حُبَيْنَاتٍ, [which is strange,] and
أُمَّاتُ حُبَيْنٍ. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  The Arabs say, in one of
their imprecations, صَبَّ اللّٰهُ عَلَيْكَ أُمَّ حُبَيْنٍ مَاخِضًا
meaning (assumed tropical:)  [May God pour upon thee] the night.
(Ibn-Buzurj, TA in art. مخص.)
حُبَيْنَةُ: see the next preceding paragraph, in
two places.
أَحْبَنُ Having the dropsy; (S, Mgh, Msb;) as
also ↓ مَحْبُونٌ (KL) [and ↓ حَبِينٌ; so in the Lex.
of Golius; and so in the present day]: having a
disease in the belly, whereby it becomes large and
swollen: (K:) fem. حَبْنَآءُ, (S, K,) applied to a
woman: (S:) pl. حُبْنٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Hence, (TA,)
the fem., (tropical:)  Big-bellied; (K, TA;) applied to a
woman. (TA.) And (assumed tropical:)  A foot (قَدَمٌ) having
much flesh in the بَخَصَةٌ [app. here meaning the
pulpy portion of the sole]; (K;) as though it
were swollen. (TA.) And (assumed tropical:)  A pigeon (حَمَامٌ)
that does not lay eggs: pl. حُبْنٌ. (K.)
مَحْبُونٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
مُحْبَئِنٌّ (assumed tropical:)  Angry. (K.)
