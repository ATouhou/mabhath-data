حرقفQ. 1
حَرْقَفَ الأَتَانَ He (an ass) took hold upon
the حَرَاقِف [pl. of حَرْقَفَة] of the she-ass [with
his fore legs]. (Ibn-'Abbád, Sgh, K.)
حَرْقَفَةٌ The bone of the حَجَبَة, which is the
head [or crest] of the hip or haunch: (S, K:)
or the head of the upper part of the hip or
haunch: (TA in art. اكم:) or [the dual]
حَرْقَفَتَانِ signifies the place where the head of
each thigh unites with, or meets, the hip or
haunch, (Zj in his “ Khalk el-Insán,” and TA, *)
externally: (TA:) [see an explanation of حَجَبَةٌ,
in which a distinction is made between this latter
term and حَرْقَفَةٌ: a distinction is also made between
them by Zj in his work cited above, as a reference
to حجبة will show:] pl. حَرَاقِفُ (S, K) and
حَرَاقِيفُ. (TA.) One says, المَرِيضُ إِذَا طَالَتْ
ضَجْعَتُهُ دَبِرَتْ حَرَاقِفُهُ [The sick man, when his
lying on the side is of long continuance, his حراقف
became galled; i. e. the exterior prominent regions
of his hip-joints]. (S.)
حُرْقُوفٌ An emaciated beast, or horse or the
like; (S, K, TA;) i. e., whose حَرَاقِيف are apparent. (TA.)
