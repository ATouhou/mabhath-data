حِطَّةٌ [A petition for the putting down of a
heavy burden from one: or, (tropical:)  of the heavy burden
of sin: or merely a putting down thereof:] a
subst. from استحطّهُ وِزْرَهُ, explained above; as
also ↓ حِطِّيطَى. (K.) It is said in the Kur [ii.
55, and vii. 161], وَ قُولُوا حِطَّةٌ; i. e. they were
told to say حِطَّةٌ for the purpose of asking thereby
for the putting down of their heavy burdens from
them, and they should be put down from them:
(Ibn-Isráeel, TA:) the meaning is, And say ye,
Put Thou down from us our heavy burdens, (S,
TA,) or (tropical:)  our sins: (Ibn-' Arafeh, K:) or [and
say ye,] Our petition is حِطَّةٌ; i. e. that Thou
wouldest put down from us our sins: (Aboo-Is-
hák, K:) or, accord. to some, حِطَّة is a word
which the children of Israel were commanded to
say; and if they said it, their heavy burdens, or
sins, were put down: (S, TA:) accord. to IAar,
it is the saying لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا اللّٰهُ: (TA:) or it means
forgiveness: (I' Ab:) or our affair is an alighting
and abiding in this town: (Bd in ii. 55:) and
there is another reading, وَ قُولُوا حِطَّةً, which is
explained in two ways; either by making the
verb to govern the noun, as though he had said,
and say ye a saying which shall put down from
you your heavy burdens, or (tropical:)  sins; or by making
the noun to be in the accus. case as an inf. n.
meaning supplicating and petitioning [that God
may put down from you your heavy burdens, or
(tropical:)  sins]; i. e. اُحْطُطِ اللَّهُمَّ أَوْزَارَنَا حِطَّةً: (TA:) but
they changed this saying, (Fr, Sgh, K,) using for
it a Nabathean expression; (Fr, TA;) saying
هِطِّى سُمْهَاثًا, i. e. ” red wheat, “(Sgh, K,) accord.
to Es-Suddee and Mujáhid; or, accord. to IAar,
حِنْطَةً شُمْقَايَا, i. e. ” good wheat. “ (Sgh, TA.)
You say also, ↓ سَأَلَهُ الحِطِّيطَى, i. e. الحِطَّةَ [He
asked of him the putting down of his heavy burden
from him: or (tropical:)  his sin]. (TA.) And it is said in
a trad., that when God tries a person with a trial
in his body, هُوَ لَهُ حِطَّةٌ, i. e. It is to him a mode
of putting down from him his sins. (TA.)
الحِطَّةُ is also A name of the month of Ramadán,
in the Gospel, or some other book: (Az, K, *
TA:) because it puts down somewhat of the sin
of him who observes the fast thereof. (Az, TA.)
―
-b2-  Also (tropical:)  A decrease, or state of diminution, in
respect of rank, or station: (TA:) [or low, or the
lowest, rank, or station: for] ↓ الحُطُطُ, (K, TA,)
which is its pl., (TA,) is explained as signifying,
(K, TA,) on the authority of IAar, (TA,) مَرَاكِبُ
السِّفَلِ, or correctly مَرَاتِبُ السِّفَلِ: (K, TA:) the
latter [meaning (tropical:)  the ranks, or stations, of the
lowest, or meanest, of mankind,] is the right
reading, as verified by Az. (TA.)

or sleek, bodies; (IAar, K, TA;) as though
