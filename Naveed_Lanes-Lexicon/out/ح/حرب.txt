حَرْبٌ War, battle, fight, or conflict; (Msb,
TA;) contr. of سِلْمٌ; (TA;) consisting, first, in
shooting arrows, one at another; then, in thrusting, one at another, with spears; then, in combating one another with swords; and then, in
grappling and struggling together: (Suh, TA:)
it is [generally] fem.; (S, L Msb;) but its dim.
is ↓ حُرَيْبٌ, without ة, (Kh, S, L, Msb,) contr. to
rule, (L, Msb,) like ذُرَيْعٌ, and قُوَيْسٌ, and فُرَيْسٌ
in a fem. sense, (L,) because originally an inf. n.
[of which the verb (حَرَبَ) seems not to have been
used as meaning “ he waged, or contended in,
war ”], (El-Mázinee, S,) or in order that it may
not be confounded with the dim. of حَرْبَةٌ: (Msb:)
Seer makes its origin to be the epithet حَرْبٌ,
which, however, is originally an inf. n.: (L:)
sometimes it is masc.; (IAar, Mbr, S, Msb, K;)
but this is extr.: (L:) the pl. is حُرُوبٌ. (S, K.)
You say, وَقَعَتْ بَيْنَهُمْ حَرْبٌ [War happened between them]. (S.) And قَامَتِ الحَرْبُ عَلَى سَاقٍ
The war, or battle, became vehement, so that
safety from destruction was difficult of attainment. (Msb.) And making it masc., as meaning
قِتَالٌ, you say حَرْبٌ شَدِيدٌ A vehement fight or
battle. (Msb.) [Hence,] اِبْنُ حَرْبٍ A warrior:
(Er-Rághib, TA in art. بنى:) and اِبْنُ الحَرْبِ [the
warrior; or] he who suffices for war, and who
defends. (Msb in that art.) And دَارُ الحَرْبِ The
country, or countries, of the unbelievers, (Msb,)
or of [those called by the Muslims] the polytheists,
(K,) between whom and the Muslims there is
not peace. (Msb, K.) In the saying of Aboo-
Haneefeh, كَانَتْ مَكَّةُ إِذْ ذٰاكَ حَرْبًا, the meaning is
دَارَ حَرْبٍ [Mekkeh was at that time a place of
which the people were at war with the Muslims].
(Mgh.)
-A2-  It is also an epithet; originally an
inf. n. (L.) You say رَجُلٌ حَرْبٌ, (K, TA,) [in
the CK حَرِبٌ, but it is] like عَدْلٌ, (TA,) A man
vehement in war, and courageous; as also ↓ مِحْرَبٌ
and ↓ مِحْرَابٌ: (K:) or ↓ مِحْرَبٌ signifies a man
of wars; (S;) or a man of war, as also ↓ مِحْرَابٌ;
and a known, experienced warrior. (TA.) [Being
originally an inf. n.,] حَرْبٌ as an epithet is used
in the same form as masc. and fem. and sing. and
pl.: (K:) so that one says اِمْرَأَةٌ حَرْبٌ and قَوْمٌ
حَرْبٌ, (TA,) as also ↓ قَوْمٌ مِحْرَبَةٌ. (S, K.) ―
-b2-
Also An enemy, (S, K,) whether, or not, actually
at war. (K.) So in the saying, أَنَا حَرْبٌ لِمَنْ
حَارَبَنَىِ [I am an enemy to him who wars with
me, or who is an enemy to me]. (S.) And فُلَانٌ
حَرْبُ فُلَانٍ Such a one is the enemy of such a one.
(TA.) Some hold that حَرْبٌ is a pl. [or rather a
quasi-pl. n.] of حَارِبٌ or مُحَارِبٌ. (TA.)
حَرَبٌ inf. n. of حَرِبَ. (A, Mgh, Msb.) وَاحَرَبَا
is an ejaculation expressive of grief, lamentation,
or regret, [meaning Alas, my spoliation! or my
loss! or my grief!] (ISd, Mgh, TA,) used in an
absolute manner, like وَا أَسَفَا, (ISd, TA,) or
يَا أَسَفَا, (Mgh,) from حَرَبَهُ “ he despoiled him of
his wealth, or property: ” (K:) [or from حَرِبَ,
q. v.:] or it originated from the fact that Harb
the son of Umeiyeh, when any one died, used to
ask his family what they required to expend on
the occasion, and used to supply them therewith;
(TA;) and when he himself died, the people of
Mekkeh and its neighbourhood bewailed him,
saying, وَا حَرْبَا, (Th, K, * TA,) or وَا حَرْبَاهْ, (TA,)
[Alas for Harb!] and then they changed the
expression to وَا حَرَبَا, (Th, K,) or وَاحَرَبَاهْ, and it
became used in the case of bewailing any person
who was dear, and in the cases of other calamities:
but this account of the origin did not please ISd.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  Also Perdition. destruction, or death.
(Har p. 158.)
حَرِبٌ: see حَرِيبٌ.
-A2-  Also (tropical:)  Angry: (A:) or
violently angry: (S, K:) applied to a man and
to a lion. (S, A.) And i. q. كَلِبٌ [meaning
Affected with canine madness]: pl. حَرْبَى, (K,)
syn. with كَلْبَى, but unknown to Az in this
sense except in one instance. (TA.)
حَرْبَةٌ [A dart, or javelin;] a certain weapon
(K) resembling a spear, (Msb,) but smaller,
(TA,) having a wide head; (As, TA;) not
reckoned among رِمَاح: (IAar, TA:) dim. ↓ حُرَيْبَةٌ:
(Msb:) pl. حِرَابٌ. (S, A, Msb, K.) You say,
أَخَذُوا الحِرَابَ لِلْحِرَابِ [They took the darts, or
javelins, for contending in war, or battle]. (A.)

حِرْبَةٌ A mode, or manner, of war, battle, fight,
or conflict. (K.)
حِرْبَاءٌ [The male chameleon;] the male of what
is called أُمُّ حُبَيْنٍ; (S, Msb, K; [but see the
latter appellation in art. حبن;]) a well-known
animal: (TA:) or a certain reptile, like the
عَظَآءَة, (K,) said to be larger than this latter,
(Msb,) somewhat larger, (S,) that turns itself,
(S, Msb,) or its head, (K,) towards the sun, (S,
Msb, K,) turning with the sun as the sun turns,
and assuming various colours (S, Msb) by reason
of the heat of the sun: (S:) Az describes it as a
reptile resembling in form what is called سَامُّ أَبْرَصَ,
with four legs, slender head, [which is not correct
as applied to the chameleon,] and striped back;
that all the day looks towards the sun; and he
adds that its flesh is impure, and the Arabs never
eat it: (TA:) [accord. to Freytag, the word,
thus applied, is said (but I know not on what
authority) to be from خُرْبَا, meaning حافظ الشمس
(guardian of the sun):] the fem. is with ة: (S:)
and the pl. حَرَابِىُّ. (S, Msb.) [The word حرباء
is used in passages cited in the TA as masc. and
fem.; whence it seems that it may be written
حِرْبَآءُ as well as حِرْبَآءٌ.] The Arabs used the expression حِرْبَآءُ تَنْضُبٍ or تَنْضُبَ, like ذئْبُ غَضًا:
(S:) [the latter word in each of these cases being
the name of a tree:] the former is proverbially
applied to a prudent man; because the حرباء does
not quit the first branch but to leap upon the
second. (TA.) The phrase اِنْتَصَبَ العُودُ فِى
الحِرْبَآءِ is used, by inversion, for انتصب الحرباءُ
فى العودِ [The male chameleon stood erect upon
the branch]: for it stands erect upon stones, and
upon the roots or trunks of trees, looking towards
the sun, and declines as the sun declines. (TA.)
―
-b2-  Also (tropical:)  The back: or its flesh: (K:) or حِرْبَآءُ
المَتْنِ means the flesh along either side of the
backbone: (TA:) or this, (TA,) or الحرباءُ, (K,)
the ridge of the backbone: (K, TA:) or حَرَابِىُّ
المَتْنِ (S, L, TA) signifies the portions of flesh,
(S,) or the flesh, (L, TA,) along either side of the
backbone: (S, L, TA:) the sing. is حِرْبَآءٌ; likened
to the حرباء [or male chameleon] of the desert,
and therefore tropical: Kr says that the sing. of
حَرَابِىُّ الظُّهُورِ is حِرْبَآءٌ accord. to rule; showing
that it has no known sing. on the authority of
hearsay. (L, TA.)
-A2-  The nails, (S,) or a nail,
(K,) of a coat of mail: (S, K:) or the head of
a nail in a ring of a coat of mail: (K:) pl. as
above. (TA.)
-A3-  And Rugged ground: (K:) or
rugged and hard ground; accord. to Th; but the
word commonly known is حِزْبَآءٌ, with záy. (TA.)
[This meaning has been supposed to be assigned

is not the case.]
