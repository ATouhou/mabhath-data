حيثحَيْثُ, (S, Msb, Mughnee, K,) indecl., (S, Msb,)
with damm for its termination, (S, Msb, Mughnee,) as being likened to final words [such as
قَبْلُ and بَعْدُ ending a proposition], (S, Mughnee,)
because it does not [regularly] occur otherwise
than prefixed to a proposition, (S,) for the being
prefixed to a proposition is like the not being prefixed to anything, as the consequence of being
prefixed, which is the sign of the gen. case, is not
apparent: (Mughnee:) and حَيْثَ, (S, Mughnee,
K,) also indecl., (S,) with fet-h, (S, Mughnee,)
to render the pronunciation more easy, (Mughnee,)
because damm with ى is deemed difficult to pronounce: (S:) and حَيْثِ, (Mughnee, K,) with
kesr, accord. to the general rule observed to
prevent the concurrence of two quiescent letters:
(Mughnee:) and in like manner, حَوْثُ and حَوْثَ
and حَوْثِ: (Mughnee, TA:) of which forms,
حوث is asserted to be the original; (L;) though
حَيْثُ is more chaste than حَوْثُ, and is the form
used in the Kur-án: (Az and TA in art. حوث:)
but some of the Arabs make حيث decl.: (Mughnee:) it is an adverbial noun of place, (S, Msb,)
a vague adverbial noun of place, (L,) [signifying
Where,] like حِينَ with respect to time: (S, K:)
or it is a denotative of place, by general consent:
but accord. to Akh it sometimes occurs as denoting time, [signifying when,] as in the following
verse, (Mughnee, TA,) which is the strongest
evidence of its use in this sense: (TA:)
حَيْثَمَا تَسْتَقِمْ يُقَدِّرْ لَكَ اللّٰ
هُ نَجَاحًا فِى غَابِرِ الأَزْمَانِ
[Whenever thou shalt pursue a right course, God
will decree thee success in the time to come]:
(Mughnee, TA:) but in most instances it occupies
the place of an accus., as an adverbial noun of
place; or of a gen., governed by مِنْ, and sometimes by another prep., as in the saying (of Zuheyr,
TA in art. قشعم),
لَدَى حَيْثُ أَلْقَتْ رَحْلَهَاأُمُّ قَشْعَمِ
[At the place where Calamity, or Fate, has put
down her saddle, i. e., made her abode]: and
sometimes it occurs as an objective complement,
as it is said to do in اَللّٰهُ أَعْلَمُ حَيْثُ يَجْعَلُ رِسَالَاتِهِ
[in the Kur vi. 124], i. e. God is knowing: He
knows where to bestow his apostolic commissions;
يَعْلَمُ being suppressed, as implied by أَعْلَمُ; or
أَعْلَمُ may be rendered by عَالِمٌ, and so may govern the accus. case. (Mughnee.) Accord. to
rule, (Mughnee,) in every instance, (S, Mughnee,)
it is prefixed to a proposition, (S, Msb, Mughnee,)
nominal, or verbal, but in most cases the latter;
(Mughnee;) as in أَقُومُ حَيْثُ يَقُومُ زَيْدٌ [I will
stand where Zeyd shall stand]; and حَيْثُ تَكُونُ
أَكُونُ [Where thou shalt be, I will be]; (S;) and
جَلَسْتُ حَيْثُ زَيْدًا أَرَاهُ [I sat where I saw Zeyd],
the accus. case being preferred in an instance like
this; (Mughnee;) and اذْهَبْ حَيْثُ شئْتَ [Go thou
whither thou wilt.] (Msb in art. حَين.) You
should not say حَيْثُ زَيْدٌ [alone]: (S:) or it occurs prefixed to a single word in poetry; (Msb,
Mughnee;) as in the saying,
وَنَطْعُنُهُمْ تَحْتَ الكُلَى بَعْدَ ضَرْبِهِمْ
بِبِيضِ المَوَاضِى حَيْثُ لَىِّ العَمَائِمِ
[And we pierce them beneath the kidneys, after
smiting them, with the sharp swords, where the
turbans are wound]; (Mughnee;) but this is
irregular; (Msb, Mughnee;) though Ks holds it
to be regular. (Mughnee.) Lh relates, on the
authority of Ks, that some make حيث to govern
a noun in the gen. case, as in the saying,
أَمَا تَرَى حَيْثُ سُهَيْلٍ طَالِعَا
[Seest thou not where Canopus is, rising?]: but
he says that this is not of respectable authority:
(L:) some write حَيْثَ سُهَيْلٍ: and some, حَيْثُ
سُهَيْلٌ, [which is the common reading, سهيل being
an inchoative, and] the enunciative, مَوْجُودٌ, being
suppressed. (Mughnee.) Abu-l-Fet-h says that
he who prefixes حيث to a single word makes it
declinable. (Mughnee.) [Accord. to Fei,] BenooTemeem say حَيْثَ when it occupies the place of
an accus., as in the phrase, قُمْ حَيْثَ يَقُومُ زَيْدٌ
[Stand thou where Zeyd shall stand]. (Msb.)
Ks says, I have heard among Benoo-Temeem, of
Benoo-Yarbooa and Tuheiyeh, those who say
حَيْثَ in every case, when it occupies the place of
a gen., and that of an accus., and that of a nom.;
saying مِنْ حَيْثَ لَايَعْلَمُونَ [Whence they know
not], and حَيْثَ الْتَقَيْنَا [Where we met]: and he
says also, I have heard some of Benu-l-HárithIbn-Asad-Ibn-El-Hárith-Ibn-Thaalabeh, and all
Benoo-Fak'as, say حَيْثِ when it occupies the
place of a gen., and حَيْثَ when it occupies the
place of an accus.; saying مِنْ حَيْثِ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ,
and حَيْثَ الْتَقَيْنَا. (L.) Sometimes the proposition
after حيث commences with إِنَّ, as in اِجْلِسْ حَيْثُ
إِنَّ زَيْدًا جَالِسٌ [Sit thou where Zeyd is sitting].
(K in art. أن, and IAk p. 92.) ―
-b2-  It sometimes
comprises the meanings of two adverbial nouns of
place, as when you say, حَيْثُ عَبْدُ اللّٰهِ قَاعِدٌ زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ
[Where' Abd-Allah is sitting, there Zeyd is standing]. (AHeyth, L.) ―
-b3-  The restrictive مَا (مَا
كَافَّةٌ) is sometimes affixed to it, and in this case
it implies a conditional meaning, [signifying
Wherever, or wheresoever, and, accord. to Akh,
whenever, or whensoever,] (Mughnee, TA,) and
renders two verbs mejzoom, (Mughnee,) as in the
saying, حَيْثُمَا تَجْلِسْ أَجْلِسْ [Wherever thou shalt
sit, I will sit], (S,) and in the first of the verses
cited above: (Mughnee, TA:) it is not [properly,
though it is sometimes improperly,] used as a
conditional without ما. (S.) ―
-b4-  [It is also used,
in scientific and other post-classical works, in
senses different from those explained above.
Thus, مِنْ حَيْثُ is used to signify As to, or in respect of: so in the phrase مِنْ حَيْثُ اللَّفْظِ وَالمَعْنَى
As to, or in respect of, the word and the meaning.
Also As, or considered as, absolutely, or abstractedly: so in the phrase مِنْ حَيْثُ هُوَ, or مِنْ
حَيْثُ هُوَ هُوَ, As, or considered as, such, absolutely, or abstractedly; and الإِنْسَانُ مِنْ حَيْثُ هُوَ
إِنْسَانٌ Man, as, or considered as, man, absolutely,
or abstractedly. And As, meaning considered
merely or only or simply as: so in the saying,
الإِنْسَانُ مِنْ حَيْثُ إِنَّهُ يَصِحُّ وَتَزُولُ عَنْهُ السِّحَّةُ
مَوْضُوعُ الطِّبِّ Man, as, or considered merely or
only or simply as, being healthy and ceasing to be
healthy, is the object of therapeutics. And As,
meaning since, or because: so in the saying,
النَّارُ مِنْ حَيْثُ إِنَّهَا حَارَّةٌ تُسَخِّنُ المَآءَ Fire, as, or
since, or because, it is hot, heats water. بِحَيْثُ
is also vulgarly used in this sense. And correctly as
meaning So that; so as that; in such a state, or
condition, that: often syn. with حَتَّى.]
