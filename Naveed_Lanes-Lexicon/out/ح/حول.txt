so says ISk: and the word is sometimes used
in relation to a woman: (TA:) or, accord. to
AZ, the water that comes forth upon the head of
the fœtus, [i. e.] at the birth: (S:) or a membrane
like a large bucket, which is full of water, and
bursts when it falls upon the ground: then comes
forth the سَلَى; and a day, or two days, after
that, the صَآءَة. (TA.) Hence the saying, نَزَلُوا
