حشر1
حَشَرَ, aor.
حَشُرَ and
حَشِرَ, (S, Msb, K,) the former
of which aors. is found in the seven readings of
the Kur, (Msb,) inf. n. حَشْرٌ, (S, Msb, K,) He
congregated, or collected together, (S, Msb, K,)
men: (S, Msb:) or he congregated them, or collected them together, and drove them: (Msb,
TA:) he made them to go forth, collected together,
from one place to another: (Bd in lix. 2:) he,
or it, compelled them to emigrate: (K, * TA: [in
the CK الخَلَآءُ is put by mistake for الجَلَاءُ, the
explanation of the inf. n.:]) and [simply] he drove
towards a place or quarter. (TA.) Hence يَوْمُ
الحَشْرِ (tropical:)  [The day of congregation, &c.; meaning]
the day of resurrection: (S, * TA:) [see also
مَحْشِرٌ:] and سُورَةُ الحَشْرِ (tropical:)  [The Chapter of the
Compulsion to emigration; which is the fifty-ninth
chapter of the Kur-an]. (TA.) It is said by most of
the expositors of the Kur that the wild animals and
other beasts, and even the flies, will be collected together (تُحْشَرُ) for retaliation; and they cite a trad.
on this subject. (TA.) So in the Kur [lxxxi. 5],
وَ إِذَا الوُحُوشُ حُشِرَتْ And when the wild animals
shall be collected together, (Bd, Jel,) from every
quarter, (Bd,) after resurrection; (Jel;) or raised
to life, (Bd,) for the purpose of their retaliating,
one upon another; after which they shall return
to dust: (Bd, Jel:) or the meaning is, shall die,
(Az, S,) in the present world; accord. to some:
(Az:) and thus says 'Ikrimeh, (S, TA,) on the
authority of I'Ab, (TA,) as is related by Sa'eed
Ibn-Masrook: (S, TA:) but accord. to some, the
two meanings are nearly the same; for each denotes collection. (TA.) حَشْرٌ also signifies The
going forth with a people fleeing or hastening or
dispersing themselves in war; when used absolutely. (TA.) ―
-b2-  حَشَرَتْهُمُ السَّنَةُ, aor.
حَشُرَ and
حَشِرَ
(Lth,) inf. n. حَشْرٌ, (K,) (tropical:)  The year of dearth destroyed their camels and other quadrupeds; because it causes the owners to collect themselves
from the various quarters to the cities or towns:
(Lth:) or it caused them to go down to the cities
or towns: (A:) or it distressed them; app., because of their collecting themselves together from
the desert to the places of settled abodes: (Abu-t-
Teiyib:) and حَشَرَتِ السَّنَةُ مَالَ فُلَانٍ The year of
dearth destroyed the camels &c. of such a one.
(S, K. *)
-A2-  حَشَرَهُ, (S, A,) inf. n. حَشْرٌ, (S, K,)
(tropical:) He made it (a spear-head, S, A) thin, or slender:
(S, A, K:) he made it (a spear-head, and a knife,)
sharp, or pointed, and thin, or slender: (TA:)
he made it small, and thin, or slender: (Th:) he
pared it; namely, a stick: (TA:) he pared it,
and made it sharp, or pointed. (S.)

انحشروا They (people) became collected together from the desert to the places of settled
abodes. (Abu-t-Teiyib.)
حَشْرٌ (tropical:)  Anything thin, or slender, or elegant.
(TA.) You say أُذُنُ حَشْرٌ (tropical:) A thin, or an elegant,
ear; (Lth, ISk, S, A, K;) as though it were
pared, (Lth, S,) and made sharp: (S:) or small,
elegant, and round: (Lth:) or thin at the end:
(Th:) or sharp-pointed: (TA:) and the epithet
is the same for the dual also and the pl.: (K:)
[J says that] it does not admit the dual form nor
the pl., because it is originally an inf. n., and the
expression above mentioned is like مَآءٌ غَوْرٌ and
مَآءٌ سَكْبٌ: but اذن حَشْرَةٌ is sometimes said: (S:)
and the pl. حُشُورٌ occurs in a verse of Umeiyeh
Ibn-Abee-'Áïdh: (TA:) and you also say اذن
↓ مَحْشُورَةٌ. (TA.) حَشْرٌ is also applied in the same
sense as an epithet to other things. (S) You say
قُذَّةٌ حَشْرٌ (tropical:)  A thin, or an elegant, feather of an
arrow; (Lth, S, A, K;) as though it were pared:
(Lth:) or sharp-pointed. (TA.) Also سِنَانٌ حَشْرٌ
(tropical:)  A thin, or slender, spear-head: (S, K:) or sharp,
or sharp-pointed: and سِكِّينٌ حَشْرٌ in like manner: and حَرْبَةٌ حَشْرَةٌ: (TA:) and سَهْمٌ حَشْرٌ, and
سِهَامٌ حُشْرٌ: like جَوْنٌ and جُونٌ, and وَرْدٌ and وُرْدٌ:
(Akh, S:) or سَهْمٌ حَشْرٌ signifies an arrow having
straight, or even, feathers; and so ↓ سهم مَحْشُورٌ;
and ↓ حَشِرٌ, of the same measure as كَتِفٌ, an arrow having good feathers attached to it. (TA.)
You also say بَعِيرٌ حَشْرُ الأُذُنِ (tropical:)  A camel having a
thin, or an elegant, ear. (TA.)
حَشِرٌ: see حَشْرٌ.
حَشَرَةٌ and حَشَرَاتٌ, (K,) each being a coll. n.
without a sing.; (TA;) or the former is sing. of
the latter; (S, Msb;) Any small animals that
creep or walk upon the earth; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;)
as jerboas and hedgehogs and lizards of the kind
called ضَبّ and the like: (TA:) or the former,
(Msb,) or latter, (Mgh,) is applied to rats or mice,
and jerboas, and lizards of the kind above mentioned, (Mgh, Msb,) colleted together: (Msb:)
or any venomous or noxious reptiles or the like,
such as scorpions and serpents; syn. هَوَامُّ; (As,

the like, birds, and fish, &c.; (K;) whether small
or great: (TA:) or the great thereof: or what
is eaten thereof: (K:) thus in all the copies of
the K; but the pronoun [in the latter case] does
not refer to the animals &c. above mentioned: it
is expressly said in the T and M that the word
signifies whatever is eaten of herbs, or leguminous
plants, of the earth, such as the دُعَاع and فَثّ.
(TA.)
حَاشِرٌ One who congregates, or collects together,
