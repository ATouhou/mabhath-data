حنظلQ. 1
حَنْظَلَتِ الشَّجَرَةُ The tree became bitter
in its fruit [like the حَنْظَل]. (AHei, TA.)
حَنْظَلٌ [The colocynth; cucumis colocynthis;]
a certain bitter plant; (Msb;) [and its fruit;]
well known; (K;) i. q. شَرْىٌ: (S:) n. un. with ة:
(S, Msb, K: *) [accord. to Freytag (who refers to
Avic. p. 175, and Sprengel. hist. rei herb. vol. i.
p. 269,) applied also to the momordica elaterium,
or cucumis prophetarum:] there is a male species,
and a female; the former fibrous; the latter soft,
or easily broken, white, and easy to swallow:
(TA:) the choice sort of it is the yellow; (K;)
or, accord. to the “ Kánoon ” of the Ra-ees [Ibn-Seenà, from which the description of its properties
and uses, in the K and TA, is, with some slight
variations, taken], the white, very white, and
soft; for the black and the hard are bad, and it
is not plucked until it becomes yellow, and the
greenness has completely gone from it; (TA:)
its pulp attenuates the thick phlegmatic humour
that flows upon the joints (K, TA) and tendons,
(TA,) when swallowed (K, TA) in the dose of
of twelve keeráts, (TA,) or used in the manner of
a cluster: it is beneficial for melancholy, and
epilepsy, and the [sort of doting termed] وَسْوَاس,
and alopecia (دَآء الثَّعْلَب), and elephantiasis
(الجُذَام), (K, TA,) and [the disease of the tumid
leg, termed] دَآء الفِيل; for these three used by
rubbing; and for the cold نِقْرِس [i. e. arthritis,
or gout], (TA,) and for the bite of vipers, and the
sting of scorpions, especially its root; (K, TA;)
for this last being the most beneficial of medicines; a drachm of its root, administered to an
Arab stung by a scorpion in four places, being
said to have cured him on the spot: that which is
plucked green relaxes [the bowels] excessively, and
produces excessive vomiting: so in the “ Kánoon: ”
(TA:) it is also beneficial for the tooth-ache, by
fumigating with its seeds; and for killing fleas,
by sprinkling what is cooked thereof; and for the
sciatica, by rubbing with what is green thereof:
(K, TA:) its root is cooked with vinegar, and
one rinses the mouth with it for the tooth-ache;
and the vinegar is cooked in it in hot ashes: when
cooked in olive-oil, that oil, being dropped [into
the ear-hole], is beneficial for ringing in the ears:
it is beneficial also for the moist and flatulent
colic: and sometimes it attenuates the blood: administered as a suppository in the vagina, it kills
the fœtus: (TA:) when the plant bears a single
fruit, this is very deadly. (K, TA.) [See also
هَبِيدٌ.] Accord. to [many of] the leading authorities among the Arabs, (TA,) the ن in this
word is augmentative; (Msb, TA;) because of
their saying, حَظِلَ البَعِيرُ, meaning “ the camel
became sick from eating حَنْظَل; ” and J and Sgh
[and Fei and others] have mentioned it in art.
حظل: but ISd says that this is not an evidence
of its being radically triliteral; and that حَظِلَ is
like ضَغْبَةٌ (as an epithet applied to a woman)
from الضَّغَابِيسُ, which must be acknowledged to
be radically quadriliteral. (TA.)
