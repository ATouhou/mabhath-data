حقن1
حَقَنَهُ, aor.
حَقُنَ and
حَقِنَ, (K,) inf. n. حَقْنٌ, (TA,)
i. q. حَبَسَهُ [as meaning He confined it; kept it
in; prevented it from escape; retained, restrained, or withheld, it]; (K;) as also ↓ احتقنهُ,
(as in some copies of the K,) or ↓ احقنهُ; (as in
other copies and in the TA;) but see, in what
follows, what is said of this last in the S. (TA.)
―
-b2-  حَقَنَ اللَّبَنَ (S, Mgh, K) فِى السِّقَآءِ, (K,)
aor.
حَقُنَ, (S,) inf. n. as above, (TA,) He collected
the milk in the skin, (S, Mgh,) and poured fresh
milk upon that which was curdled, or thick, or
upon that which was churned: (S:) or he poured
the milk into the skin, [and kept it therein] that
its butter might come forth. (K.) And حَقَنَ
المَآءَ فِى السِّقَآءِ, aor.
حَقُنَ, inf. n. as above, He collected
the water in the skin. (Msb.) ―
-b3-  حَقَنَ البَوْلَ,
(Ks, S, M,) or بَوْلَهُ, (Mgh, Msb,) He kept in,
or retained, (M, Mgh, Msb,) and collected, (Mgh,
Msb,) the urine, (M,) or his urine: (Mgh, Msb:)
one should not say ↓ احقنهُ; (Ks, S, M;) nor
should one say [of the urine] حَقَنَنِى هُوَ. (M.)
―
-b4-  حَقَنَ دَمَهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) and حَقَنَ لَهُ دَمَهُ,
(TA from a trad.,) (tropical:)  He prevented or forbade, the
shedding of his blood, (S, Mgh, TA,) and the slaying him; (TA;) [he spared his blood, or forbore to
shed it;] i. e., (Mgh,) he saved him (Mgh, K) from
slaughter (K) when it had become lawful to slay
him; from حَقَنَ اللَّبَنَ; (Mgh;) contr. of هَدَرَهُ;
as though he collected his blood in him, and did
not pour it forth. (Msb.) ―
-b5-  حَقَنَ مَآءَ وَجْهِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He
preserved [the lustre of his face; meaning his
honour, or reputation]. (TA.) ―
-b6-  حَقَنَ المَرِيضَ
(S, * Mgh, Msb, K *) He administered to the
sick person what is termed حُقْنَة, i. e. [a clyster,]
a medicine put into a مِحْقَنَة; (Mgh;) he conveyed medicine into the inside of the sick person
by his anus (مِنْ مَخْرَجِهِ) with the مِحْقَنَة. (Msb.)
See also 8.
4
احقن He collected different sorts of milk
[in a skin, old and fresh,] to become good. (K.)
―
-b2-  See also 1, in two places.
5
تَحَقَّنَتِ الإِبِلُ The camels became full in
their insides. (TA.)
8
احتقن as a trans. v.: see 1.
-A2-  Also It
(blood) collected in the inside in consequence of a
spear-wound, or stab, or the like, penetrating
thereinto. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And He (a man) administered to himself, or had administered to him,
a حُقْنَة [or clyster]: (S, * Mgh, Msb:) or he (a
sick man) made use of the حُقْنَة in consequence of
suppression of his urine. (K.) The saying اِحْتَقَنَ
الصَّبِىُّ بِلَبَنِ أُمِّهِ [meaning The child had its
mother's milk administered to it as a clyster] is farfetched: and اُحْتُقِنَ is not allowable: the right
expression is ↓ حُقِنَ, or عُولِجَ بِالحُقْنَةِ. (Mgh.)
―
-b3-  And اِحْتَقَنَتِ الرَّوْضَةُ The روضة [i. e. meadow,
or garden,] had its sides elevated عَلَى سَائِرِهَا
[above the rest of it]: so says AHn: in the K,
على سَرَارِهَا [above the depressed, or the best, or
most fruitful, part of it: in the CK, سِرارِها].
(TA.)
حَقِنٌ: see حَاقِنٌ.
حَقْنَةٌ A pain in the belly: pl. أَحْقَانٌ. (IAar, K.)
حُقْنَةٌ The administration of a medicine to a
sick person by his anus; (TA;) [i. e. the administration of a clyster;] the conveyance of a
medicine to the inside of a sick person by his
anus with the مِحْقَنَة. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  And hence,
(Msb,) [A clyster;] a medicine so administered
to a sick person: (S, Mgh, Msb, K:) pl. حُقَنٌ.
(Msb.) ―
-b3-  And, by extension of the meaning,
The tube of a مِحْقَنَة. (Mgh.)
حَقِينٌ Confined, kept in, prevented from escape,
retained, restrained, or withheld; as also ↓ مَحْقُونٌ.
(K.) ―
-b2-  And, as a subst., (S,) Milk collected in
a skin, (S, IF, Msb,) when fresh milk has been
poured upon that which has become curdled, or
thick, or upon that which has been churned.
(S, TA.) Hence the prov., أَبَى الحَقِينُ العِذْرَةَ;
i. e. العُذْرَ; [The milk collected in the skin, &c.,
has disallowed the excuse;] (A 'Obeyd, S, TA;)
applied to him who excuses himself when having
no [real] excuse: (TA:) originally said by a
man who asked some people to give him milk
to drink, upon their excusing themselves while
they had milk which they had collected in a
skin; meaning, this حقبن belies you. (A 'Obeyd,
TA.)
حَاقِنٌ A man keeping in, or retaining, and
collecting, his urine; from حَقِينٌ meaning “ milk
collected in a skin: ” (IF, Msb:) [suffering from
retention of the urine:] having urine that distresses [by its quantity]: (S, TA:) having much
urine retained and collected: (Mgh:) and ↓ حَقِنٌ
signifies the same. (TA.) Hence the saying,
(Mgh, TA,) in a trad., (TA,) لَا رَأْىَ لِحَاقِنٍ وَلَا
حَاقِبٍ وَلَا حَازِقٍ (S, * Mgh, TA *) No counsel, or
advice, is possible to one who has much urine
retained and collected, nor to one suffering suppression of the feces, nor to one who is pinched
by a tight boot. (Mgh, TA. *) ―
-b2-  [Collecting
grease, or melted grease, in a skin.] You say,
أَنَا مِنْهُ كَحَاقِنِ الإِهَالَةِ (assumed tropical:)  I am a person skilled
in it; because such a one does not collect the
اهالة in a skin until he knows that it has cooled,
lest the skin should be burnt. (K.) ―
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  A moon
a little after or before the change (هِلَال) having
its two extremities elevated, and its back decumbent. (K.) Hence the saying, هِلَالٌ وَاقِفٌ خَيْرٌ
مِنْ هِلَالٍ حَاقِنٍ (tropical:)  [A هلال erect (here meaning
nearly erect) is better, or more auspicious, than
a هلال decumbent]. (A, TA.) [See also أَذْفَقُ.]
الحَاقِنَةُ The stomach; (K;) an epithet in which
the quality of a subst. is predominant; because
it retains, or collects, the food: (TA:) and the
pit between each collar-bone and what is termed
حَبْلُ العَاتِقِ [explained in art. حبل, q. v.]; (AA,
S, K; *) the two together being termed [the]
حَاقِنَتَانِ: (AA, S:) the pit of each collar-bone:
(T, TA:) the part between the collar-bone and
the neck: (TA:) or the lower part of the belly:
(S, K:) pl. الحَوَاقِنُ. (T, TA.) [See also الذَّاقِنَةُ.]
Hence, (K,) it is said in a prov., لَأُلْحِقَنَّ حَوَاقِنَكَ
بِذَوَاقِنِكِ, (S, K,) i. e. [I will assuredly conjoin] the
lower part of thy belly with the upper part
thereof: or the part of thy belly that retains, or
collects, the food, with the lower part of thy belly,
and with thy knees. (TA.) The ذَاقِنَة is [also
said to be] the extremity of the حُلْقُوم [or windpipe]: and hence the saying attributed to 'Áïsheh,
that the Prophet died [with his head] between
her حَاقِنَة and her ذَاقِنَة. (S.)
مِحْقَنٌ A skin in which milk is collected;
fresh milk being poured into it upon that which
is curdled, or thick, or upon that which has been
churned: (S:) or a skin into which milk is
poured, [and in which it is kept,] that its butter
may come forth. (K.) ―
-b2-  And A funnel with
which the milk is poured into the skin: (Az, K: *)
or a funnel which is put into the mouth of a
skin, into which one then pours wine, and water.
(TA.)
[
مَحْقَنَةٌ app. sing. of مَحَاقِنُ as used in the
following saying; like as مَحْقَلَةٌ is sing of مَحَاقِلُ.]
بَارَكَ اللّٰهُ فِى مَحَاقِلِكُمْ وَمَحاقِنِكُمْ May God bless
your seed-produce and your progeny. (TA.)
مِحْقَنَةٌ The thing with which a حُقْنَة [or clyster]
is administered; (Mgh, Msb;) being a leathern
pouch, furnished with a tube. (Mgh.)
مِحْقَانٌ One who retains his urine, and, when
he discharges it, discharges much: (S, K:) applied
by ISd peculiarly to a camel. (TA.)
مَحْقُونٌ: see حَقِينٌ.
