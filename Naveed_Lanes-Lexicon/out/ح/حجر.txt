حَجْرٌ: see حِجْرٌ, in three places.
-A2-  Also, and
↓ حِجْرٌ, (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K TA,) [the latter of
which I have found to be the more common in
the present day,] and ↓ حُجْرٌ, (K, [but this I have
not found in any other lexicon, and the TA, by
implication, disallows it,]) The حِضْن; (Mgh,
Msb, K;) [i. e. the bosom; or breast; agreeably
with explanations of حِضْن in the K: or] the
part beneath the armpit, extending to the flank;
(Mgh, Msb;) [agreeably with other explanations
of حِضْن;] of a man or woman: (S A, Mgh,
Msb, K:) pl. حُجُورٌ. (S, Msb.) Hence the saying, (Mgh,) فُلَانٌ فِى حَجْرِ فُلَانٍ (assumed tropical:)  Such a one is
in the protection of such a one; (AZ, T, Mgh,
Msb;) as also ↓ فى حَجْرَتِهِ. (TA.) And نَشَأَ
↓ فِى حِجْرِهِ and حَجْرِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He grew up in his care

حُجْرٌ: see حِجْرٌ, in three places:
-A2-  and حَجْرٌ:
―
-b2-  and مَحْجِرُ العَيْنِ.
حِجْرٌ (S A, Mgh, Msb, K) and ↓ حُجْرٌ (S,
Mgh, Msb, K) and ↓ حَجْرٌ, (S, K,) of which the
first is the most chaste, (S,) and ↓ مَحْجَرٌ (S, K)
and ↓ حَاجُورٌ (K) [and ↓ مَحْجُورٌ], Forbidden,
prohibited, unlawful, inviolable, or sacred. (S,
A, Mgh, Msb, K.) Each of the first three forms
occurs in different readings of the Kur vi. 139.
(S.) You say, هٰذَا حِجْرٌ عَلَيْكَ This is forbidden,
or unlawful, to thee. (A.) In the time of paganism,
a man meeting another whom he feared, in a
sacred month, used to say, ↓ حِجْرًا مَحْجُورًا,
meaning It is rigorously forbidden to thee [to
commit an act of hostility against me] in this
month: and the latter, thereupon, would abstain
from any aggression against him: and so, on
the day of resurrection, the polytheists, when
they see the punishment, will say to the angels,
thinking that it will profit them: (Lth, S: *) but
Az says that I' Ab and his companions explain
these words [occurring in the Kur xxv. 24] otherwise, i. e., as said by the angels, and meaning,
the joyful annunciation is forbidden to be made
to you: and accord. to El-Hasan, the former
word will be said by the sinners, and the latter
is said by God, meaning it will be forbidden to
them to be granted refuge or protection as they
used to be in their former life in the world:
but Az adds, it is more proper to regard
the two words as composing one saying: (TA:)
and the latter word is a corroborative of the
former, like مَائِتٌ in the expression مَوْتٌ مَائِتٌ.
(Bd.) The same words in the Kur xxv. 55
signify A strong mutual repugnance, or incongruity; as though each said what one says who
seeks refuge or protection from another: or, as
some say, a defined limit. (Bd.) A man says
to another, “Dost thou so and so, O such a one?”
and the latter replies حِجْرًا, or ↓ حُجْرًا, or ↓ حَجْرًا,
meaning [I pray for] preservation, and acquitment, from this thing; a meaning reducible to
that of prohibition, and of a thing that is prohibited. (Sb.) The Arabs say, on the occasion
of a thing that they disapprove, لَهُ ↓ حُجْرًا, with
damm, meaning, May it be averted. (S.) ―
-b2-
Homeyd Ibn-Thowr says,
فَهَمَمْتُ أَنْ أَغْشَى إِلَيْهَا مَحْجَرًا
وَلَمِثْلُهَا يُغْشَى إِلَيْهِ المَحْجَرُ
meaning, And I purposed doing to her a forbidden action: and verily the like of her is one
to whom that which is forbidden is done. (S, K.)
↓ مَحْجَرٌ is also explained as signifying حُرْمَةٌ;
[app. meaning a thing from which one is bound
to refrain, from a motive of respect or reverence;]
and to have this meaning in the verse above.
(Az.) ―
-b3-  Also, the first of these words, Any حَائِط
[i. e. garden, or walled garden of palm-trees,]
which one prohibits [to the public]. (S.) ―
-b4-  And
الحِجْرُ That [space] which is comprised by [the
curved wall called] the حَطِيم, (S, A, Mgh, K,)
which encompasses the Kaabeh on the north [or
rather north-west] side; (S, A, K;) on the side
of the spout: (Mgh:) or the حطيم [itself],
which encompasses the Kaabeh on the side of the
spout. (Msb.) [It is applied to both of these
in the present day; but more commonly to the
former.] ―
-b5-  Also, حِجْرٌ, The anterior pudendum
of a man and of a woman; and so ↓ حَجْرٌ: (K,
TA:) the latter the more chaste. (TA.) ―
-b6-  A
mare; the female of the horse: (S, A, Msb, K:)
and a mare kept for breeding; (A;) as though
her womb were forbidden to all but generous
horses: (T:) but in the latter sense the sing. is
scarcely ever used; though its pl., the first of
the following forms, (as well as the second, A,)
is used to signify mares kept for breeding: (K:)
↓ حِجْرَةٌ, as a sing., is said by F and others to
be a barbarism: it occurs in a trad.; but perhaps
the ة is there added to assimilate it to بَغْلَةٌ, with
which it is there coupled: (MF:) the pl. [of
pauc.] is أَحْجَارٌ (Msb, K) and [of mult.] حُجُورٌ
(A, Msb, K) and حُجُورَةٌ. (K.) A poet says,
إِذَا خَرِسَ الفَحْلُ وَسْطَ الحُجُورِ
وَصَاحَ الكِلَابُ وَعَقَّ الوَلَدْ
When the stallion, seeing the army and the
gleaming swords, is mute in the midst of the
mares kept for breeding, and does not look
towards them, and the dogs bark at their masters,
because of the change of their appearances, and
children behave undutifully to their mothers whom
fear diverts from attending to them. (A.) ―
-b7-
Relationship [that prohibits marriage]; nearness with respect to kindred. (Msb, K.) ―
-b8-  Understanding, intelligence, intellect, mind, or reason:
(S, A, Msb, K:) so in the Kur lxxxix. 4: (S,
Bd:) thus called because it forbids that which
it does not behoove one to do. (Bd.) One says,
فِى ذٰلِكَ عِبْرَةٌ لِذِي حِجْرٍ In that is an admonition
to him who possesses understanding, &c. (A.)
-A2-
See also حَجُرٌ, in three places.
حَجَرٌ [A stone; explained in the K by صَخْرَةٌ;
but this means “a rock,” or “a great mass of
stone” or “of hard stone”]; (S, K, &c.;) so
called because it resists, by reason of its hardness;
(Mgh;) and ↓ أُحْجُرٌّ signifies the same: (Fr, K:)
pl. (of pauc., of the former, S) أَحْجَارٌ (S, Mgh,
K) and أَحْجُرٌ (K) and (of mult, S) حِجَارٌ and
[more commonly] حِجَارَةٌ, (S, K,) which last is
extr. [with respect to rule], (S,) or agreeable
with a usage of the Arabs, which is, to add ة to
any pl. of the measure فِعَالٌ or of that of فُعُولٌ,
as in the instances of ذِكَارَةٌ and فِحَالَةٌ and ذُكُورَةٌ
and فُحُولَةٌ. (AHeyth.) And (metonymically,
TA) (tropical:)  Sand: (IAar, K;) pl. أَحْجَارٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-
[Hence,] أَهْلُ الحَجَرِ The people of the desert,
who dwell in stony and sandy places: occurring
in a trad., coupled with أَهْلُ المَدَرِ. (TA.) ―
-b3-
الحَجَرُ الأَسْوَدُ, and simply الحَجَرُ, The [Black]
Stone of the Kaabeh. (K, TA.) El-Farezdak
applies to it, in one instance, the pl. الأَحْجَارُ,
considering the sing. as applicable to every part
of it. (TA.) ―
-b4-  One says, فُلَانٌ حَجَرُ الأَرْضِ,
meaning (assumed tropical:)  Such a one is unequalled. (TA.) And
رُمِىَ فُلَانٌ بِحَجَرِ الأَرْضِ (tropical:)  Such a one has had
a very sagacious and crafty and politic man
made to be an assailant against him. (K, * TA.)
El-Ahnaf Ibn-Keys said to 'Alee, when Mo'á-
wiyeh named 'Amr Ibn-El-'Ás as one of the two
umpires, قَدْ رُمِيتَ بِحَجَرِ الأَرْضِ فَاجْعَلْ مَعَهُ ابْنَ
عَبَّاسٍ فَإِنَّهُ لَا يَعْقِدُ عُقْدَةً إِلَّا حَلَّهَا (assumed tropical:)  Thou hast had
a most exceedingly sagacious and crafty and
politic man made to be an assailant against thee:
so appoint thou with him Ibn-'Abbás; for he
will not tie a knot but he shall untie it: meaning
one that shall stand firm like a stone upon the
ground. (L from a trad.) One says also, رُمىَ
فُلَانٌ بِحَجَرِهِ, meaning (tropical:)  Such a one was coupled
[or opposed] with his like: (A:) [as though he
had a stone suited to the purpose of knocking him
down cast at him.] ―
-b5-  لِلْعَاهِرِ الحَجَرُ, occurring in
a trad., means (assumed tropical:)  For the fornicator, or adulterer,
disappointment, and prohibition: accord. to some,
it is meant to allude to stoning; [and it may
have had this meaning in the first instance in
which it was used;] but [in general] this is not
the case; for every fornicator is not to be stoned.
(IAth, TA.) [See also art. عهر.] ―
-b6-  الحَجَرُ Gold:
and silver. (K.) Both together are called
الحَجَرَانِ. (S.)

is a coll. gen. n., of which the former is the n. un.,]
and حَجَرَاتٌ (S, K) and ↓ حَوَاجِرُ: (K:) the last
is mentioned by ISd as being thought by him to
be a pl. of حَجْرَةٌ in the sense above explained,
contr. to analogy. (TA.) Hence, حَجْرَةٌ قَوْمٍ The
tract or quarter adjacent to the abode of a
people. (S.) And حَجْرَتَا الطَّرِيقِ The two sides
of the road. (TA.) And حَجْرَتَا عَسْكَرٍ The two

wings. (TA.) And قَعَدَ حَجْرَةً He sat aside.
(A.) And سَارَ حَجْرَةً He journeyed aside, by
himself. (TA.) And ↓ مَحْجَرًا is also said to signify the same, in the following ex.: تَرْعَى مَحْجَرًا
وَتَبْرُكُ وَسَطًا She (the camel) pastures aside, and
lies down in the middle. (TA.) It is said in a
prov., يَرْبِضُ حَجْرَةً وَيَرْتَعِى وَسَطًا He lies down
aside, and pastures in the middle: (S:) or فُلَانٌ
يَرْعَى وَسَطًا وَيَرْبِضُ حَجْرَةً Such a one pastures in
the middle, and lies down aside: (TA:) applied
to a man who is in the midst of a people when
they are in prosperity, and when they become in
an evil state leaves them, and lies down apart:
the prov. is ascribed to Gheylán Ibn-Mudar. (IB.)
Imra-el--Keys says, [addressing Khálid, in whose
neighbourhood he had alighted and sojourned,
and who had demanded of him some horses and
riding-camels to pursue and overtake a party
that had carried off some camels belonging to
him (Imra-el-Keys), on Khálid's having gone
away, and returned without anything,]
فَدَعْ عَنْكَ نَهْبًا صِيحَ حَجَرَاتِهِ
وَلٰكِنْ حَدِيثًا مَا حَديثُ الرَّوَاحِلِ
[Then let thou alone spoil by the sides of which a
shouting was raised: but relate to me a story.
What is the story of the riding-camels?]: hence

وَدَعْ عَنْكَ نَهْبًا صِيحَ فِى حَجَرَاتِهِ
[Dominion belongeth to God: then let thou alone
&c.]; said with reference to him who has lost
part of his property and after that lost what is of
