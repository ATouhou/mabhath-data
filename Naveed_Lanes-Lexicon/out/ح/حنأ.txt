تحنّأ It (his head, or his beard,) was dyed
with حِنَّآء (AHn, K.)
حِنَّآءٌ [A certain plant] well known; (S, K;)
[the Lawsonia inermis, or Egyptian privet;]
used for dyeing the extremities [i. e. the hands and
feet and head]: (TA:) [in the present day, the
plant itself is called ثَمَرُ الحِنَّآءِ, (vulgo تَمَرحِنَّا,)
and its leaves, used for dyeing the hands &c., are
called حِنَّآء:] accord. to some, it is the pl. of حِنَّآءَةٌ;
[or rather a coll. gen. n., of which حنّآءة is the
n. un.;] but it is generally asserted that حنّآءة
is a more special word than حنّآء, [as in the S and
Msb,] and not the sing. of the latter: (TA:) pl.
حُنْآنٌ. (K.) حُنَّآنٌ is said to be an anomalous pl.
of حنّآء; or a dial. var. of the latter, and not a pl.:
(TA:) and حِنَّانٌ is a dial. var. of حِنَّآءٌ. (Fr, Th,
TA in art. حن.)
حِنَّائِىٌّ A seller of حِنَّآء: pl. حِنَّائِيُّونَ. (K.)
أَخْضَرُ حَانِئٌ Very green; intensely green. (K,
