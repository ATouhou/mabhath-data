at him; or was ashamed to do it, or shy of doing
it: (Mgh, K:) or it signifies, (Mgh,) or signifies
also, (K,) he shrank from it, or him: (Mgh, K:)
or, as some say, thus used it is vulgar; for حِشْمَةٌ,
with the Arabs, is only anger: (Mgh:) but IB
cites, from Kutheiyir,
إِنِّى مَتَى لَمْ يَكُنْ عَطَاؤُهُمَا
عِنْدِى بِمَا قَدْ فَعَلْتُ أَحْتَشِمُ
as meaning [Verily I, when the gift of them two
in my possession is not for what I have done,] am
ashamed, or abashed: and in a trad. of 'Alee,
respecting the thief, occurs the saying, إِنِّى لَأَحْتَشِمُ
أَنْ لَا أَدَعَ لَهُ يَدًا, meaning Verily I am ashamed
not to leave him a hand; and I shrink from it.
(TA.) [And ↓ حَشَمَ app. signifies the same; for,]
accord. to As, (TA,) [the inf. n.] حُشُومٌ signifies
The act of shrinking. (K.) You say also, إِنِّى
مِنْهُ ↓ لَأَتَحَشَّمُ Verily I abstain from it, or refrain

pride; disdain, or scorn, it; (أَتَذَمَّمُ مِنْهُ;) and
am ashamed of it. (K.)
-A2-  Also He was, or became, master of many حَشَم [or dependents &c.]
and servants. (KL.)
حَشَمٌ A man's special dependents, consisting of
his family and slaves [and others], or his neighbours, who are angry on his account (K, TA)
when an event befalls him; (TA;) as also ↓ حُشْمَةٌ;
(Yoo, TA;) in the K, erroneously, حَشَمَةٌ; (TA;)
and أَحْشَامٌ; (K;) which IAar thinks to be pl.
of حَشَمٌ used in a sing. sense; (TA;) [for] this
word is applied to one [of such persons] as well
as to a pl. number: (K:) you say, هٰذَا الغُلَامُ
حَشَمٌ لِى [This young man, or slave, is a dependent of mine]: (IAar, TA:) or حَشَمٌ signifies,
(ISk, Mgh, Msb,) or signifies also, (K,) a man's
relations and household; (ISk, Mgh, Msb, K;)
or his servants; (S, Msb;) and those who are
angry on his account (ISk, S, Mgh, Msb) when
an event befalls him; (Mgh, Msb;) for which
reason they are thus called: (S:) or a man's
followers; and those on whose account he should
be angry: (Ham p. 614:) or the حَشَم of a man
are those who are angry on his account; or those
on whose account he is angry: (Har p. 164:)
accord. to ISk, (Msb,) it is a word having a pl.
signification, and having no proper sing.: (Mgh,
Msb:) but some say that it has for its pl. أَحْشَامٌ:
(Mgh:) and accord. to the K, ↓ حُشَمَآءُ [in the
CK حَشْمَاء] signifies neighbours and guests; as
though it were pl. of حَشِيمٌ, like as كُرَمَآءُ is of
كَرِيمٌ: but [perhaps this should be أَحْشَامٌ; for]
we find in the M, هٰؤُلَآءِ أَحْشَامِى, meaning These
are my neighbours, and my guests: (TA:) and
↓ حُشُمٌ, with two dammehs, signifies slaves;
(IAar, TA;) or, as some say, followers, whether
slaves or free persons. (TA.)
-A2-  Also An object
of desire or quest; syn. طَلَبَةٌ [in the CK طَلَبَة];

his object of desire or quest. (TK.)
حُشُمٌ Persons having, or possessing, (ذَوُو, as in
the explanation of IAar, for which ذُو is erroneously substituted in the copies of the K, TA,)
consummate shame, shyness, bashfulness, or pudency. (IAar, K, TA.) ―

A woman, or a wife; syn. مَرْأَةٌ. (K, TA.)
-A2-  I. q.
ذِمَامٌ [app. as meaning protection, safeguard, or
security of life and property]. (Yoo, K.) So in
the phrase, لَهُ الحُشْمَةُ [Protection, &c., is due to
him]. (Yoo, TA.) ―
-b2-  Relationship. (K.) So in
the phrase, فِيهِمْ حُشْمَةٌ [Among them is relationship]. (TA.)

حِشْمَةٌ Anger. (As, S, Mgh, Msb, TA.) ―
-b2-  And
Shame, shyness, bashfulness, or pudency; (S,
Msb, K;) and a shrinking (Lth, Mgh, K, TA)
from one's brother in a place of eating, and in
seeking, or requesting, a thing that one wants.
(Lth, Mgh, TA.) It has been asserted, (Mgh,
Msb, TA,) on the authority of As, (Msb, TA,)
that it signifies only “anger:” (Mgh, Msb, TA:)
but several authors have refuted this assertion,
by showing that it occurs in trads. as meaning
“shame.” (MF, TA.) ―
-b3-  Also The act of annoying a person sitting with one, and saying to him
what he dislikes; and so ↓ حُشْمَةٌ. (K.)
حُشَمَآءُ, in the CK حَشْمَاء: see حَشَمٌ.
حُشُومٌ: see حَشَمٌ, last sentence but one.
-A2-  It
is also an inf. n. of 1. (K.)
حَشِيمٌ, (S, K,) in some of the copies of the S
حِشِّيمٌ, which is app. a mistake, (TA,) [thus I
find it in one of my copies of the S,] i. q. ↓ مُحْتَشَمٌ;
(S, K;) i. e. Regarded with reverence, veneration, respect, honour, awe, or fear; (TA;) applied
to a man. (S.)
حَاشِمٌ A man being, or becoming, fat, or in a
good condition of body, after leanness. (TA.)
مَحْشُومٌ Angered. (TA.) [But it is implied in
the S that it signifies Confounded and stupified
by shame; or ashamed and confounded or stupified, and remaining speechless and motionless.]
A poet says,
لَعَمْرُكَ إِنَّ قُرْصَ أَبِى خُبَيْبٍ
بَطِىْءُ النُّضْجِ مَحْشُومُ الأَكِيلِ
[By thy life, verily the round cake of bread of
Aboo-Khubeyb is slow in becoming thoroughly
baked: the eater is angered, or confounded and
stupified by shame, &c.]. (S, TA.)
مُحْتَشَمٌ: see حَشِيمٌ.
إِنَّهُ لَمُحْتَشِمٌ بِأَمْرِى Verily he is grieved and disquieted (مُهْتَمٌّ) by my affair, or case. (AA, TA.)
