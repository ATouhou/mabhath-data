-b2-  [Used as
a simple subst., it signifies A narrative, story,
or tale:] pl. حَكَايَاتٌ. (TA.) ―
-b3-  As a conventional term in grammar, [meaning Imitation, or
conforming, in language,] it is of two kinds:
حِكَايَةُ جُمْلَةٍ [The imitation of a proposition, or
phrase], and حِكَايَةُ مُفْرَدٍ [The imitation of a
single word]: the former is of two sorts; one of
which is termed حِكَايَةُ مَلْفُوظٍ [The imitation of
a thing uttered], whereof قَالُوا الحَمْدُ للّٰهِ [They
said, “Praise be to God,” (Kur vii. 41,)] is an
ex.; and the other, حِكَايَةُ مَكْتُوبٍ [The imitation
of a thing written], whereof قَرَأْتُ عَلَى فَصِّهِ مُحَمَّدٌ
رَسُولُ اللّٰهِ [I read upon his ring-stone, “Mohammad is the Apostle of God,”] is an ex.: and the
latter kind, also, (that of a single word,) is of
two sorts; one of which is with the interrogative أَىٌّ or مَنْ, as when, to one who says, رَأَيْتُ
رَجُلًا [pronounced رَجُلَا, I saw a man], you say,
أَيَّا [What (man)?], or مَنَا [Whom?], and the
like, which sort is agreeable with a common
rule; the other sort being without an interrogative, as the saying of one of the Arabs, to one
who said, هَاتَانِ تَمْرَتَانِ [These are two dates],
دَعْنَا مِنْ تَمْرَتَانِ [Abstain thou from troubling
us about two dates], which sort is anomalous.
(El-Ashmoonee's Expos. of the Alfeeyeh of Ibn-Málik.) [حِكَايَةُ صَوْتٍ signifies A word imitative
of a sound; an onomatopœia: see اِسْمُ صَوْتٍ
in art. سمو.]
