احتسى He dug out the sand from a حِسْى
to procure the water beneath: (S:) he dug out
the earth for the water to come forth: (TA:)
and احتسى حِسْيًا (T, K) he fetched out, by digging,
the water of a حِسْى; so as heard by Az from
more than one of Benoo-Temeem: (TA:) or he
dug a حِسْى; as also ↓ حَسَاهُ. (K.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,]
(assumed tropical:)  He asked, or sought, information, news, or
tidings. (TA.) ―

حَسْىٌ: see what next follows.
حِسْىٌ (T, S, K) and ↓ حِسًى (Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà,
AAF, K) and ↓ حَسْىٌ, accord. to the K, but this
is unknown, and the correct word is حَسًا, [or
rather ↓ حَسًى,] mentioned by IAar, (TA,) Water
which the earth imbibes from sand [above it],
and which, when it reaches what is hard, is
arrested thereby: one digs out the sand from over
it, and draws it forth: (S:) or accumulated sand,
beneath which is hard rock, so that, when the
sand is rained upon, it imbibes the water of the
rain, which, reaching the rock beneath, is arrested
thereby, and the sand prevents the heat of the
sun from drying up the water; wherefore, when
the heat is vehement, the upper portion of the
sand is dug out from over the water, and it wells
forth, cold and sweet, and is taken by little and
little: (Az, TA:) or soft, or plain, ground, in
which water remains and collects: or rugged
ground, over which is sand, that collects the rainwater; so that whenever a bucketful is drawn forth,
another collects: (K, TA:) so in the M: (TA:)
pl. [of pauc.] أَحْسَآءٌ (S, K) and [of mult.] حِسَآءٌ:
(K:) أَحْسَآءٌ is syn. with كِرَارٌ. (S.) [See also
حَشْرَجٌ.] ―
-b2-  حِسْىٌ also signifies A small quantity
of water; and so ↓ حَسَآءٌ. (Th, TA.)
