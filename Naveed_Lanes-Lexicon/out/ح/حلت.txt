حلتحِلِّيتٌ: see what follows.
حِلْتِيتٌ; (S, K;) for which you should not say
حِلْتِيثٌ, with ث; sometimes written حِلِّتِيتٌ; (S;
as in one copy; but in another, and in that from
which SM quotes, حِلِّيتٌ;) and ↓ حِلِّيِتٌ; (K;)
[Assa, or asa: of which there are two kinds;
حِلْتِيتٌ مُنْتِنٌ, or assa fœtida; and حلتيتٌ طَيّبٌ
or assa dulcis:] the gum of the أَنْجُذَان: (S K:)
ISd says, حلتيت is an Arabic or an arabicized
word: [and is the name of a certain plant:] I
have not heard that it grows in Arabia; but it
grows between Bust and the country of El-Keekán:
it is he says, a plant that lies prone upon the
ground, and from the middle of it there comes
forth, and rises high, a reed, or cane, at the head
whereof is a knob (كُعْبُرَةٌ): it is also, he adds,
the name of the gum that comes forth at the roots
of the leaves of that reed, or cane: the people of
the part above mentioned, he says, cook the plant
thus called, and eat it; and it is not a plant that
remains during the winter. (TA.) In the T, Az
states that حلتيت is said, on the authority of Lth,
to be the same as انجرد [app. a mistake for أَنْجُرَة;
or for أَنْجِزَد, from the Persian أَنْگِCَدْ, signifying
assa fœtida]; but, he adds, the word that I remember to have heard as the same as انجرد is
خلتيت, with خ; and I do not think it to be
genuine Arabic. (TA, here and in art. خلت.)
