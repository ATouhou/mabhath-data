حُيُودٌ and حَيْدَةٌ (S, Msb, K) and حَيْدٌ and حَيَدَانٌ
and مَحِيدٌ (K) and حَيْدُودَةٌ, (S, K,) which last
is originally حَيَدُودَةٌ, with the ى movent; this
letter being afterwards made quiescent; for there is
not in the language any word of the measure
فَعْلُولٌ, except صَعْفُوقٌ; (S; [see the remarks
on شَيْخُوخَةٌ, voce شَاخَ;]) He declined, or turned

went away, or went far away, from it; (Msb;)
namely, a road, (S,) or a thing: (Msb:) he
shunned, or avoided, it, from fear, or from
disdain. (Az, L.) [See also 3.] You say, مَا
لَكَ مَحِيدٌ عَنْ ذٰلِكَ There is not, for thee, any avoiding that. (L.) And حَادَتِ الدَّابَّةُ The beast became
scared, or shied, and quitted the middle of the
road. (L.) ―
-b2-  حاد بِهِ, and ↓ احادهُ, He removed,
took away, or took far away, him, or it; [عَنْ
شَىْءٍ from a thing;] similar to ذَهَبَ بِهِ and
أَذْهَبَهُ. (Msb.)

حَيْدٌ A rising, or protuberant, or prominent,
part of a side of a thing: (L, K:) so of the
head; (Lth, L;) as also ↓ حَيْدَةٌ: (A:) a knot,
knob, or protuberance, of a stick or branch; [as
also ↓ حَيْدَةٌ: (AHn, TA voce بَلْطٌ, q. v.:)] a
part of a strap, or thong, projecting beyond the
rest: (L:) any rib, (L, K,) or other bone, (L,)
that curves much [and is therefore prominent]:
(L, K:) [see an ex. voce حَابٍ, in art. حبو:]
a knot in the horn of a mountain-goat; (A, *
L, K;) or this is termed ↓ حَيْدَةٌ: (S, L:) a
twisted part of a horn: a twisted internodal
portion of a horn: (L:) any prominence in a
horn, and in a mountain, (S, L, K,) &c.: (S, L:)
a prominent and curved part of a mountain:
(T:) a projecting portion, or ledge, of a mountain, resembling a wing: (S, M, L, K:) pl. (of
the former word, S) أَحْيَادٌ [a pl. of pauc.] and
(of both words, S) حُيُودٌ and (of the latter, S)
حِيَدٌ: (S, K:) the حُيُود of a camel are such
parts as the hips, or haunches, and thighs. (L.)
You say جَبَلٌ ذُو حُيُودٍ and أَحْيَادٍ, meaning A
mountain having projecting edges in its lower
parts, not in its upper parts. (S.) And قَعَدْتُ
تَحْتَ حَيْدِ الجَبَلِ I sat beneath the part of the
mountain that projected like a wing. (A.)
حَيْدَةٌ: see حَيْدٌ, in three places. ―
-b2-  Also The
rugged part of a road. (A.) ―
-b3-  An evil look,
(A, K,) with a turning aside. (A.) You say,
مَا نَظَرَ إِلَىَّ إِلَّا الحَيْدَةَ, (A,) or إِلَّا نَظَرَ الحَيْدَةِ,
(TA,) He looked not towards me save with an
evil look, with a turning aside. (A, TA.)
حَيَدَى The manner of walking of a proud and
self-conceited person. (K.) ―
-b2-  حِمَارٌ حَيَدَى (S, K)
and ↓ حَيِّدٌ, (K,) each occurring in a verse of
[Umeiyeh the son of] Aboo-'Áïdh El-Hudhalee
accord. to different relations thereof, (L, [see
جَمَّازٌ,]) An ass that turns aside from, or shies at,
his shadow, by reason of his briskness, liveliness, or
sprightliness: (S, K:) or that is wont often to turn
aside from things, or to shy at them. (S.) حَيَدَى is
also applied as an epithet to a she-ass. (IAar.)
It is [said to be] the only masc. epithet of the
measure فَعَلَى, (S, K,) except دَلَظَى a man “ who
thrusts vehemently,” (IJ,) and وَقَرَى [but this
is written in the K وَقَرِىٌّ] “ a pastor of a وَقِير,
or flock of sheep,” and قَفَطَى vir “ multum
coiens,” and جَمَزَى a “ quick ” ass. (MF.) But
probably حَيِّدٌ is the only correct word of the
two above mentioned. (L.) [Or حِمَارٌ حَيَدَى is
for حِمَارٌ ذُو حَيَدَى: see جَمَزَى, voce جَمَّازٌ.]
حَيْدَانٌ Pebbles that become thrown aside from
the legs of a beast as he goes along. (S, K.)
حَيِّدٌ: see حَيَدَى.
حَيَادِ, like قَطَامِ, (L,) indecl., with kesr for its
termination, [and of the fem. gender,] occurs
in the phrase (TA) حِيدِى حَيَادِ, similar to
فِيحِى فَيَاحِ, (S, L, K,) meaning Turn thou aside,
or away, [from me:] (A, L:) said by one when
the time for fighting is come, (L,) and by one
fleeing. (Ibn-Abi-l-Hadeed.)
حَيُودٌ [That declines, or goes away, much, or
frequently]: an intensive epithet, applied by
'Alee to worldly prosperity (الدُّنْيَا). (L.)
مَحِيدٌ an inf. n. of حَادَ. (K.) ―
-b2-  [It may also
be used, agreeably with analogy, as a noun of
place, signifying A place to which one turns
aside or away; to which one removes, goes away,
or goes far away.]
