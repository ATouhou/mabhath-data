حذم1
حَذَمَهُ, (S, Msb, K,) aor.
حَذِمَ, (Msb, K,) inf. n.
حَذْمٌ, (S, Msb,) He cut it, or cut it off, (S, Msb,
K,) in any manner: (TA:) or hastily, or quickly.
(K.) ―
-b2-  And [He did it quickly: or] he was
quick in it; [as also حَذَمَ فِيهِ;] i. e., in any
action. (S, Msb.) You say, حَذَمَ فِى مَشْيِهِ,
(Msb,) and قِرَآءَتِهِ, فى (S, K,) He was quick [in his
walking, or going, and in his reading, or reciting]:
(S, Msb, K:) and so in other things: (K:) by
“ other things ” being here meant walking and
the like; for حَذْمٌ, of which the verb is حَذَمَ,
signifies the being quick in walking, app. with a
stretching out of the arms backwards: (TA:)
and a light, an active, or an agile, walking. (S,
TA.) [See also حَذَمَانٌ, below.] Hence, (Mgh,
Msb, TA,) 'Omar said, (S, TA,) to the مُؤَذّن of
Jerusalem, (TA,) إِذَا أَذَّنْتَ قَتَرَسَّلْ وَإِذَا أَقَمْتَ
فَاحْذِمْ, (S, A, Mgh, Msb, TA,) i. e. [When thou
chantest the أَذَان, be moderate; not quick: and
when thou chantest the إِقَامَة,] cut short the
lengthening of thine utterance; meaning, be quick
in the اقامة: (As, Mgh, TA:) another reading
is said to have been given by Z, namely, [فَاخْذِمْ,]
with خ. (TA.)
حَذَمٌ The flight of a bird that has its wings
clipt, (K, TA,) as the pigeon and the like. (TA.)
حَذِمٌ A sharp, or cutting, sword; as also ↓ حِذْيَمٌ,
with kesr to the ح, (K,) and with fet-h to the
ى; (TA;) or ↓ حَذِيمٌ. (So in two copies of
the S.)
حُذَمٌ and ↓ حُذَمَةٌ Short in stature and in step;
(K;) applied to a man: (TA:) and the latter is
likewise fem.; (S, K, TA;) applied to a woman
as meaning short in stature. (S, TA.)
حُذُمٌ Swift hares. (IAar, K. [See also حُذَمَةٌ.])
―
-b2-  And Skilful thieves. (IAar, K.)
حُذَمَةٌ; see حُذَمٌ. ―
-b2-  One says of the female
hare, حُذَمَةٌ لُذَمَةٌ تَسْبِقُ الجَمْعَ بِالأَكَمَةِ, i. e.
Swift, persistent in running, she outstrips the
company pursuing her upon the hill. (TA.)
حَذَمَانٌ Quickness in walking or going: (K:)
accord. to Aboo-'Adnán, a pace of the kind
termed ذَمِيلٌ, exceeding what is termed مَشْىٌ.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  And Slowness (K, TA) in walking or
going: so says Aboo-'Adnán on the authority of
Khálid Ibn-Jembeh. (TA.) Thus it bears two
contrary meanings. (K.)
حُذَامٌ an epithet applied to a slave: so in the
saying, اِشْتَرَى عَبْدًا حُذَامَ المَشْىِ He bought a
slave slow [in gait], lazy, (K, TA,) devoid of
good: so says Khálid Ibn-Jembeh. (TA.)
