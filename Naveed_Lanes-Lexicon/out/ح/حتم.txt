حتم1
حَتَمَهُ, aor.
حَتِمَ, (K,) inf. n. حَتْمٌ, (S, TA,) He
made it, or rendered it, firm; or established it, or
settled it, firmly; namely, a thing, or an affair.
(S, K, TA.) ―
-b2-  He decreed it; ordained it; pronounced it; or decided it judicially: (TA:) and
so حَتَمَ بِهِ. (TK.) [See حَاتِمٌ.] ―
-b3-  He necessitated
it; or made it, or rendered it, necessary, requisite,
or unavoidable; syn. أَوْجَبَهُ: (S, K, * TA:) and so
حَتَمَ بِهِ. (Msb.) See حَاتِمٌ. You say, حَتَمْتُ
عَلَيْهِ الشَّىْءَ I made it, or rendered it, necessary,
&c., for him to do, or to suffer, the thing. (S.
[Golius, reading أَوْحَيْتُ for أَوْجَبْتُ, the explanation in the S, has rendered حَتَمَ as signifying
“ inspiravit: ” and the next explanation given by
him, i. e. “ indicavit,” is a misprint for “ judicavit. ”]) Or حَتَمَ عَلَيْهِ الأَمْرَ, aor. and inf. n. as
above, signifies He made the thing, or affair, or
event, to be absolutely, or decisively, or irreversibly,
necessary, requisite, or unavoidable, for him to do,
or to suffer. (Msb.) حُتُومٌ, which is pl. of حَتْمٌ,
may also be an inf. n. of حَتَمَ, and is likewise pl. of
حَاتِمٌ. (TA.)

تحتّم He made a thing to be necessary, or
unavoidable. (K, * TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence, perhaps,]
تحتّم لِفُلَانٍ بِخَيْرٍ He wished such a one good:
or he augured good for him. (K.) ―
-b3-  See also 7.
-A2-
[It (a thing that was eaten) was soft, yielding,
crummy, or easily broken.] It is said in the S
that التَّحَتُّمُ signifies الهَشَاشَةُ: but in a marginal
note it is stated that there is an omission in this explanation, the right rendering being هشاشة الشَّىْءِ
المأْكُولِ. (TA.) One says, هُوَ ذُو تَحَتُّمٍ [It is
soft, yielding, crummy, or easily broken: explained
in the K by هَشَاشٌ, which is evidently a mistranscription for هَشَاشٌ, syn. with هَشٌّ]. (S, K.)
And هُوَ غَضُّ المُتَحَتَّمِ [It is fresh, juicy, sappy,
or moist, in its soft, yielding, crummy, or crumbling, nature; مُتَحَتَّمٌ being a regular inf. n.]
(S, K.) ―

that was soft, yielding, crummy, or easily broken,

of bread &c. (TA.) It is said in a trad. that he
who eats and does this will enter Paradise. (TA.)
-A3-  تحتّم لِكَذَا He was, or became, cheerful, brisk,
lively, or sprightly, by reason of such a thing. (K.)

as a decree judicially decided]. (TA.) And
Umeiyeh Ibn-Abi-s-Salt says,
عِبَادُكَ يُخْطِئُونَ وَأَنْتَ رَبٌّ
بِكَفَّيْكَ المَنَايَا والحُتُومُ
[Thy servants sin: and Thou art a Lord: in thy

of crow; and here, app., particularly to the raven]: (Msb:) or the black غُرَاب: (S, K:) and
[the bird called] غُرَابُ البَيْنِ, [see art. بين,] which
is red in the beak and legs: (K:) said by Lh to
be that which is fond of plucking out its feathers,
and which is held to be of evil omen. (TA.) ―

And [hence,] حَاتِمٌ signifies also Unlucky, or inauspicious. (TA.) ―

حَنْتَمْ, of the measure فَنْعَلٌ, signifies A green
jar (خَزَفٌ أَخْضَرُ, meaning جِرَّةٌ): it is also applied
to anything [of the colour termed] أَسْوَد: and
الأَخْضَرُ is, with the Arabs, أَسْوَدُ [which may mean
either that green is, with the Arabs, termed اسود,
or that الاخضر is, with the Arabs, black; but the
former appears to be the right meaning: see
أَسْوَدُ]. (Msb.) [See أَخْضَرُ: and see also what
here follows.]
