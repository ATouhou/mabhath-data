حَجَفٌ: see what next follows, in two places.
حَجَفَةٌ A shield made of skins, (S, K, TA,) or,
as some say, of the skins of camels, cut out in a
round form, (TA,) without wood and without
sinews; (S, K, TA;) as also دَرَقَةٌ: (S:) or of
skins sewed one over another; as also دَرَقَةٌ:
(ISd:) or a small shield made of two [pieces of]
skins sewed together, one over the other: (Msb:)
pl. ↓ حَجَفٌ, (S, Msb, K,) [or rather this is a
coll. gen. n.,] and [the pl. is] حَجَفَاتٌ. (Msb.)
The saying of the rájiz, (S,) namely, Su-r-edhDhi-b, (TA,)
بَلْ جَوْزِتَيْهَآءَ كَظَهْرِ الحَجَفَتْ
means رُبَّ جَوْزِ تَيْهَآءَ [i. e. Many a middle of a
desert in which one loses his way, like the back
of a shield such as is called حجفة]: and [by
احجفت is meant الحجفه; for] some of the
Arabs, in pausing upon a ة, make it ت: thus
they say, هٰذَا طَلْحَتْ, and خُبْزُ الذٌّرَتْ: (S, Sgh:)
these are Teiyi. (Sgh, TA.) ―
-b2-  (tropical:)  The breast, or
chest; (Abu-l-'Omeythil, K:) as being likened

coll. gen. n.] ↓ حَجَفٌ. (Abu-l-'Omeythil, K.)
مُحَاجِفٌ Fighting with another, having a
حَجَفَة: (S, K:) opposing reciprocally. (K.)
