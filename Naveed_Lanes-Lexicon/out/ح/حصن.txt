nor decorous, (Th, S, Mgh, Msb, K,) or from that
which induces suspicion or evil opinion: (Sh and
TA in explanation of the first of these epithets:) or
married; having a husband: (K:) or حَصَانٌ has
both of these significations: (Ham p. 101:) and
accord. to Th, (S,) ↓ مُحْصَنَةٌ, with fet-h only, has
the latter signification; (S, Mgh, * Msb; *) and
means caused to be continent or chaste, or to abstain from that which is unlawful or indecorous,

the Kur, is read by all ↓ مُحْصَنَات, (A 'Obeyd,
TA,) meaning having husbands; (A 'Obeyd, Mgh,

captives, their marriage-tie is cut: but in other
instances, some read thus, understanding it in the
sense last explained; and others read ↓ مُحْصِنَات,
as meaning that have become Muslimehs:
(A 'Obeyd, TA:) in the Kur iv. 29, it means
free women: and in the Kur v. 7, continent, or
chaste, women: (Mgh: [in the Msb, it is said
to have the latter of these last two meaning in

of the Arabs. (Fr, TA.) ―

of usage: (S, Msb:) or a stallion horse; or one
fit to cover: (TA voce رَاحَ:) the حِصَان is. so
called because he preserves his rider: (TA:) or
because his back is like the حِصْن to his rider;
