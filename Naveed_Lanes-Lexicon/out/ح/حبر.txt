being happy, &c., (شَادْ شُدَنْ,) assigns to حُبِرَ جِلْدُهُ,

a state of ease and plenty; syn. نَعْمَةٌ: (IAth,
K: [in the CK and in a MS. copy of the K, erroneously, نِعْمَة:]) or a state of complete, or perfect, ease and plenty: (Az:) and ampleness of
the circumstances of life. (IAth.) [See 1. Hence
the saying,] بَعْدَهَا عَبْرَةٌ ↓ كُلُّ حَبْرَةٍ [After every
state of happiness, or joy, &c., is a tear]. (A.)
حَبِيرٌ A [garment of the kind called] بُرْد, variegated, (مُوَشَّىِ,) (K,) [i. e.] striped. (TA.) One
says بُرْدٌ حَبِيرٌ and بُرْدُ حَبِيرٍ. (TA.) [See also
حِبَرَةٌ. Hence the saying,] لَبِسَ حَبِيرَ الحُبُورِ وَاسْتَوَى
عَلَى سَرِيرِ السُّرُورِ (tropical:)  [He clad himself with the
mantle of cheerfulness, and seated himself firmly
upon the couch of happiness]. (A.) ―

former حُبْرٌ. (K.) ―
-b3-  And Clouds; syn. سَحَابٌ:
(S:) or clouds spotted (مُنَمَّرٌ); (K;) in which
one sees what resembles تَنْمِير, by reason of the

حُبَارَى [a word respecting which J says,] its
alif [written ى] is not the fem. alif nor the alif
of quasi-coordination; [as F says of the alif of
قَبَعْثَرًى, though he finds fault with J for saying
thus of the alif of حُبَارَى; (see أَلِفُ التَّكْثِيرِ, in
art. ا)] the name [says J] being only composed
with it, so that it is as it were a part of the word
itself, which is imperfectly decl. when determinate and when indeterminate; i. e., without
tenween: (S:) but its alif is the fem. alif; for
were it not so, it would be perfectly decl.; (K;)
and J says that it is imperfectly decl.: (TA:)
and his saying that the alif is [as it were] a part
of the word itself is a strange expression, for
which it would be difficult to give an answer,
and which therefore requires not exorbitance:
but “ it is sufficient excellence for a man that his
faults may be counted: ” (M:) [A species of
bustard;] a certain bird, (S, Msb, K,) well
known, of the form of the goose, with a dustcolour upon its head and belly, and the back and
wings of which are for the most part of the
colour of the quail; (Msb;) or it is a long-necked
bird, of an ash-colour, of the form of the goose,
with a beak somewhat long, and that is preyed
upon, but does not itself prey: Az says that it
does not drink water, and that it lays its eggs
in distant sands: [the truth is, that it drinks
seldom: the male bird has a pouch, extending
from beneath the tongue to the breast, said to be
large enough to contain seven quarts of water;
and it has been supposed by some that he fills
this with water for the supply of himself and his
mate:] and Az further says, We used, when we
journeyed, to proceed in the mountains of EdDahnà, and sometimes we picked up in one day
between four and eight of its eggs: it lays four
eggs, of a bluish colour, more delicious in taste
than those of the domestic hen and than those of the
ostrich: and others say that it brings its food
from a greater distance than any other bird;
sometimes from a distance of many days' journey:
also, that it is constantly provided with a thin
excrement, or dung, which it voids upon the hawk
when pursued by the latter; thus saving itself,
by preventing the hawk from continuing its flight,
and, as some say, causing its feathers to drop off:
whence the prov., أَسْلَحُ مِنْ حُبَارَى: [see art.
سلح:] (TA:) حُبَارَى is applied alike to the
male and the female, and used as sing. and pl.:
(S, K:) but it has pl. forms, (TA,) namely,
حُبَارَيَاتٌ (S, Msb, K, TA) and حُبَارَاتٌ: (TA:)
accord. to Sb, it has not حَبَارٍ, [in the TA incorrectly written حَبَارِى, as though it had the
article ال prefixed to it, or were prefixed to another
noun,] nor حَبَائِرُ, [though both of these are mentioned as pls. of it in several of the grammars
of the Arabs,] in order to distinguish between
حُبَارَى and nouns of the measures فَعْلَآءُ and فِعَالَةٌ
and the like. (TA.) It is said in a prov.,
وَكُلُّ شَىْءٍ قَدْ يُحِبُّ وَلَدَهْ
حَتَّى الحُبَارَى وَتَطِيرُ عَنَدَهُ
[And everything certainly loves its offspring:
even the bustard; and it flies by its side]: (S,
Mgh: *) [in the TA, وَيَدِفُّ عَنَدَهْ:] it flies by the
side of its young one to teach it to fly before its
wings have grown, because of its stupidity: (TA:)
the حبارى is thus specially mentioned because
it is proverbial for stupidity, and, notwithstanding its stupidity, loves its offspring, and teaches
it to fly. (S, Mgh.) Another prov. is, فُلَانٌ مَيِّتْ
كَمَدَ الحُبَارَى [Such a one is dying with the concealed grief of the bustard]: because the حبارى
moults with other birds, but its new feathers are
slow in coming: so when the other birds fly, it
is unable to do so, and dies of concealed grief.

together, (مَجْلِس,) of unrighteous persons [or
revellers]: (S, K:) from حَبَرَهُ “ it made him
happy,” &c. (S.)
مًحْبَرَةٌ, (Msb, K,) which is the most approved
form, (Msb, TA,) and ↓ محْبَرَةٌ, (S, Msb,) because
it is an instrument, (Msb, TA,) a correct form,
though said in the K to be incorrect, (TA,) and
↓ مَحْبُرَةٌ (Msb, K) and ↓ مَحْبُرَّةٌ, (K,) the last
used by poetic license, (TA,) The place, (S, K,)

ink is put: (S, K, TA:) pl. مَحَابِرُ. (Msb.)
