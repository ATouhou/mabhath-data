order, consecutively. (A, TA.) It is said in a
trad., إِنَّ الرَّحِمَ أَخَذَتْ بِحُجْزَةِ الرَّحمٰنِ [Verily

حَاجِزٌ A thing intervening, as a separation, a
partition, a fence, a barrier, or an obstacle, or
obstruction, between two other things, (TA,) or
between two things facing, or opposite to, each
other; (Az, A, TA;) as also ↓ حِجَازٌ. (Az, A,

between the Ghowr, or Ghór, and Syria (Mgh,

mountains, (Mgh, Msb, *) or by the five Hirár,
namely, the Harrah of Benoo-Suleym and that of
Wákim and that of Leylà and that of Showrán
and that of En-Nár. (As, K.) ―

حَجَزَةٌ, (K,) which latter signifies Wrongers, or
wrongdoers, who prevent one from obtaining his
right: (S:) or persons who defend men, one from
another, and decide between them justly. (Az,
TA.) In the K, the signification of “wrongers,
or wrongdoers,” is combined with the contrary
explanation given by Az. (TA.) It is said in a
trad. of Keyleh, أَيْعُجِزُ ابْنُ هٰذِهِ أَنْ يَنْتَصِفَ مِنْ
وَرَآءِ الحَجَزَةِ [Is the son of this woman unable to
obtain his right in the absence of the wrongdoers
who prevent his doing so?]: (S:) or [according
to one relation] أَيُلَامُ ابْنُ ذِهْ أَنْ يَفصِلَ الخُطَّةَ مِنْ
وَرَآءِ الحَجَزَة [Is the son of this woman to be
blamed for deciding the affair in the absence of
those who defend men, one from another, and
decide between them justly?]: by “the son of this
woman” she means her own son: she says, if he
suffer a wrong, and allege for himself that which
repels from him the wrong, [without having recourse to the judge,] he is not to be blamed.
(TA.) [See also خُطَّةٌ.]
مَحْجُوزٌ Hit, or hurt, in the place [or part of

[that part of her person which is termed] the
عَوْرَة. (TA.)
