حَسَا, (S, Msb, K,) aor. يَحْسُو, (Msb,) inf. n.
حَسْوٌ, (S, Msb,) and some say that حَسْوَةٌ also is
an inf. n., (Msb,) [but this is properly an inf. n.
of un.,] He (a man) supped, or sipped, or drank
by little and little, (K,) soup, or broth, (S, K,)
or سَوِيق, and the like; (Msb;) as also ↓ احتسى

-b2-  One says
also of a bird, حَسَا المَآءَ, (Msb, K,) aor. as above,
(Msb,) inf. n. حَسْوٌ, (Msb, K,) like as one says
of a man, شَرِبَ; (TA;) [He sipped the water:]
one should not say, in this case, شَرِبَ. (Msb, K.)
Hence the prov., (Msb,) نَوْمٌ كَحَسْوِ الطَّيْرِ [A
sleeping like the sipping of the bird] i. e., of
short duration; (S, M, Msb, TA;) likened, in
its quick ending, to a bird's swallowing water:
(Msb:) in the copies of the K, يَوْمٌ [a day];
and so in [some copies of] the S, and in the A.
(TA.) And the saying, نِمْتُ نَوْمَةً كَحَسْوِ الطَّيْرِ
I slept [a sleep like the sipping of the bird;
meaning,] a short sleep. (T, Msb. *)

chaste: (K:) some say that these are dial. vars.,
like نَغْبَةٌ and نُغْبَةٌ, and جَرْعَةٌ and جُرْعَةٌ: but
accord. to Yoo, the former denotes the act, and
the latter is the [proper] subst. (TA.) See also

what is supped, or sipped: (K:) or as much as

that this is an inf. n. [of un.]: (Msb:) pl. حُسًى
[for an ex. of which see 4] (Msb, TA) and حُسْوَاتٌ
or حُسَوَاتٌ or حُسُوَاتٌ (Msb) and [of pauc.] أَحْسِيَةٌ

أَحْسُوَةٌ], and pl. pl. أَحَاسِى [or rather أَحَاسٍ], (K,)

[In the vessel is a sup, or sip]. (S, Msb.) See
also حَسْوَةٌ.

sweetened: (IAth:) also called ↓ حَسُوٌّ (Sh, S,
Msb, K) and ↓ حَسِيَّةٌ (Sh, K) and ↓ and
