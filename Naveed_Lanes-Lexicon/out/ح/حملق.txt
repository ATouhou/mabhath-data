حُمْلُوقٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
مُحَمْلِقٌ Eyes having around their globes a whiteness unmixed with blackness: [it would seem to
be a mistranscription for مُحَمْلِقَةٌ; but perhaps it
is an epithet applied to a man having eyes of this
description; for it is immediately added,] whence
عَيْنٌ مُحَمْلِقَةٌ [app. meaning an eye having around
it such a whiteness]. (TA.)
