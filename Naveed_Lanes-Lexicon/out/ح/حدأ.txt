حدأحَدَأٌ: see حَدَأَةٌ:
-A2-  and see also حِدَأَةٌ, in two
places.
حِدَأٌ: see حِدَأَةٌ, in three places:
-A2-  and see
also what next follows.
حَدَأَةٌ (As, S, K) and ↓ حِدَأَةٌ, but the former is
the more chaste, (TA,) A double-headed فَأْس
[i. e. hoe, or adz, or axe]: (As, S, K:) [a kind
of فَأْس used in the present day is a hoe with two
heads, one at each end of the handle:] or the
head of a فَأْس: and the head of an arrow: (K:)
pl. of the former ↓ حَدَأٌ (As, S, K) [or rather this
is a coll. gen. n.] and حِدَآءٌ, (K, TA, [in the CK
حَداءٌ,]) mentioned by AO and As and A 'Obeyd;
(TA;) and the pl. of حِدَأَةٌ is ↓ حِدَأٌ (TA) [or
rather this, like حَدَأٌ, is a coll. gen. n.].
-A2-  See
also the next paragraph, in two places.
حِدَأَةٌ, (S, Msb, K,) or ↓ حِدَأٌ, [but see what
follows,] sometimes pronounced ↓ حَدَأٌ, (Mgh,)
[The kite; vulgarly called حِدَايَة;] a certain
bird, (S, Mgh, K,) well known; (S, K;) a certain noxious bird; (Msb;) surnamed أَبُوالخَطَّافِ
and ابو الصَّلْتِ; (TA;) that preys upon large
field-rats (جِرْذَان): (Mgh, TA:) J and Sgh say
that the word should not be pronounced ↓ حَدَأَةٌ;
but AHei mentions this pronunciation on the
authority of [some of] the Arabs; and accord. to
IAar and IAmb, the فَأْس [see above] and this
bird were sometimes called alike ↓ حَدَأَةٌ and
↓ حَدَأٌ: the more approved pronunciation of the
name of the bird, however, is with kesr [i. e.
حِدَأَةٌ]: the pl. is ↓ حِدَأٌ (S, Msb, K) and حِدَآءٌ,
(K,) both extr., (TA,) [or rather the former is a
coll. gen. n.,] and حِدْآنٌ: (Msb, K:) and the
following are variations of the name of this bird:
حُدَّى, and حُدَيَّا, (TA,) the latter said by AHát
to be an erroneous form of the word, used by the
people of El-Hijáz, (Mgh, TA,) and ↓ حُدَيْئِيَةٌ,
app. a dim., for ↓ حُدَيْئَةٌ, also pronounced حُدَيَّةٌ,
(TS, TA,) and حُدُوٌّ, occurring in a trad. in conjunction with أُفْعُوٌّ [for أَفْعًى], (Mgh, TA,) of the
dial. of the people of Mekkeh. (TA in art. حدو.)
Hence the saying, وَرَآءَكِ بُنْدُقَة ↓ حِدَأَ حِدَأَ, (S, K,
TA,) for which the vulgar say, حَدَا حَدَا, (S,)
[accord. to some, meaning O kite, O kite, a bullet
is behind thee: accord. to others, O Hidà, O
Hidà, Bundukah is behind thee:] Esh-Sharkee
(Ibn-El-Kutámee, TA) says, (S,) حِدَأٌ and بُنْدُقَةُ
were two tribes, descendants of حِدَأُ بْنُ نَمِرَةَ and
بُنْدُقَةُ بْنُ مَظَّةَ, (S, K, *) and both of سَعْدُ العَشِيرَةِ;
(S, TA;) the former in El-Koofeh, and the latter
in El-Yemen: the former attacked the latter, and
obtained spoil from them; and then the latter
attacked the former, and destroyed them: (TA:)
and hence this saying: (S, K, TA:) or حِدَأَ is
here an apocopated form of حِدَأَة: (S, K:) so
says ISk: (S:) and AO says that by it is here
meant the bird [i. e. the kite]; and by بندقة, the
thing with which one shoots [from a cross-bow,
namely, a bullet]; and the prov. is used to caution
a person: accord. to Ibn-El-Kelbee, it is applied
to him who esteems himself cunning in an affair,
and is outwitted therein by another: accord. to
the A, to him who is threatened with an evil near
at hand. (TA.)
-A2-  حِدَأَةٌ also signifies The سَالِفَة
(meaning the fore part, TA, [or the fore part
from beneath the ear to the middle of the collarbone,]) of the neck of a horse: (As, K:) pl. حِدَآء/ق.
(As, TA.)
-A3-  See also حَدَأَةٌ.
حُدَيْئَةٌ and حُدَيْئِيَةٌ: see the next preceding
paragraph.
