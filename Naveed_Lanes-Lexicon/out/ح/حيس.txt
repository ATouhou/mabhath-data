حيس1
حَاسَ, aor. يَحِيسُ, inf. n. حَيْسٌ, He mixed
[a thing or things]. (S, A, K; but in this sense,
only the inf. n. is mentioned.) ―
-b2-  He made, or
prepared, what is called حَيْس: (S, Msb, K:)
and ↓ حيّس, inf. n. تَحْيِيسٌ, he mixed and prepared what is so called. (TA.)

حَيَّسَ see above.
حَيْسٌ, originally an inf. n., (Msb,) Dates mixed
with clarified butter and [the preparation of
dried curd called] أَقِط, (S, A, Mgh, K,) and
kneaded (A, K) vehemently, (A,) or rubbed and
pressed with the hand until they mingle together,
(Mgh,) whereupon their stones come forth; (K;)
and sometimes سَوِيق [or meal of parched barley
or wheat] is put into it; (A, K;) and a little
crumbled bread instead of the اقط: (TA:) or
dates, of the kind called بَرْنِىّ, and اقط, bruised
together, and kneaded vehemently with clarified
butter until the stones come forth from it one
by one, and then made like ثَرِيد: it is the same
as وَطْبَةٌ, except that حيس sometimes has سويق
put in it, but وطبة has not: (L:) or dates of
which the stones have been taken out, bruised
with اقط, and then kneaded, and rubbed and
pressed with the hand until the whole becomes
like ثريد; and sometimes سويق is put with it:
(Msb:) accord. to Ibn-Waddáh El-Andalusee,
dates of which the stones have been taken out,
mixed with سويق; but this is not known, (MF,
TA,) because of the deficiency of the ingredients:
(TA:) Hr is related to have described it as a
ثَرِيدَة composed of أَخْلَاط [or various mixtures].
(TA.) A rájiz says,
اَلتَّمْرُ وَالسَّمْنُ مَعًاثّمَّ الأَقِطْ
اَلْحَيْسُ إِلَّا أَنَّهُ لَمْ يَخْتَلِطْ
[Dates and clarified butter together, then اقط,
are حيس, except that it is not yet mixed]: (S,
MF, TA:) from which it might be understood,
that these components, when mixed, are not
حيس: but this is the contrary of what is meant:
(MF:) the meaning seems to be, that these
three things, when brought, are virtually حيس,
as being the materials thereof, though not mixed.
(TA.)
