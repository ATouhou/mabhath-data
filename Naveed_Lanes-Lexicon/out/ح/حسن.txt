حسن1
حَسُنَ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K, &c.,) which may also
be written and pronounced حَسْنَ, with the dammeh
suppressed, (S,) and حَسَنَ, (K,) aor.
حَسُنَ, (TA,) inf. n.
حُسْنٌ (S, * Msb, K, * TA) and حُسْنَى, (Ham p. 657,
and Bd in ii. 77,) He, or it (a thing, S, Msb),
had, or possessed, the quality termed حَسْنٌ [which
see below; i. e., was, or became, good, or goodly,
(generally the latter,) beautiful, comely, or pleasing,
&c.; and ↓ تحسّن often signifies the same, as in
the phrase تحسّن عِنْدَهُ it was, or became, good,
&c., in his estimation]: (S, K, TA:) and [in like
manner] زَيْدٌ ↓ أَحْسَنَ means Zeyd became possessed
of حُسْن. (Mughnee in art. بِ.) ―
-b2-  One may not
say حُسْنَ, transferring the dammeh of the س to
the ح and making the former letter quiescent,
except in one case; because it is [virtually, together with its agent expressed or implied, in this
case,] a predicate: [see I'Ak p. 234:] this is
allowable only in the case of a verb of praise or
dispraise; حُسْنَ, in respect of the transference of
the medial vowel, being likened to نِعْمَ and بِئْسَ,
which are originally نَعِمَ and بَئِسَ: and thus one
does in all verbs like these two in meaning: a
poet says,
لَمْ يَمْنَعِ النَّاسُ مِنِّى مَا أَرَدْتُ وَ مَا
أُعْطِيهِمُ مَا أَرَادُوا حُسْنَ ذَا أَدَبَا
[Men have not withheld from me what I have
desired, nor do I give them what they have desired: good, or very good, is this as a mode of conduct!]: meaning حَسُنَ هٰذَا أَدَبًا. (S, TA.) You
say also, حَسُنَ زَيْدٌ, [meaning Good, or goodly,
&c., or very good &c., is Zeyd! or] meaning
بِهِ ↓ أَحْسِنْ [i. e. how good, or goodly, &c., is Zeyd!
as also ↓ مَا أَحْسَنَهُ]. (B, TA in art. بِ.)
2
حسّنهُ, (S, K,) inf. n. تَحْسِينٌ, (S,) He made
it, or rendered it, حَسَن [i. e. good, or goodly,
(generally the latter,) beautiful, comely, or pleasing, &c.]; (K;) he beautified, embellished, or
adorned, it; (S, TA;) as also ↓ احسنهُ. (TA.)
You say, الحَلَّاقُ رَأْسَهُ ↓ أَحْسَنَ The shaver beautified, or trimmed, his head. (TA.) And الَّذِى
كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقَهُ ↓ أَحْسَنَ [Who hath made good, or
goodly, everything that He hath created], in the
Kur [xxxii. 6], means حَسَّنَ خَلْقَ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ [hath
made good, or goodly, the creation of everything].
(TA.) ―
-b2-  [See also تَحْسِينٌ.] ―
-b3-  And see 10.
3
إنِّى أُحَاسِنُ بِكَ النَّاسَ (S, TA) Verily I contend with men for thy superiority in حُسْن [i. e.
goodness, or goodliness, &c.]. (TA.) [حَاسَنَ followed by an accus. is rendered by Golius, as on
the authority of J, who gives no explanation of
it, “Bene tractavit et egit. ”]
4
احسن as an intrans. v.: see 1. ―
-b2-  Also He
did that which was حَسَن [meaning good, comely,
or pleasing; he acted well]; (Msb;) he did a
good deed: (Er-Rághib, TA:) [for] إِحْسَانٌ is the
contr. of إِسَآءَةٌ: (K:) it differs from إِنْعَامٌ in being to oneself and to another; whereas the latter
is only to another: (TA:) and it surpasses عَدْلٌ,
inasmuch as it means the giving more than one
owes, and taking less than is owed to one; whereas
the latter means the giving what one owes, and
taking what is owed to one. (Er-Rághib, TA.)
You say, أَحْسَنْتُ إِلَيْهِ and بِهِ [I acted, or behaved,
with goodness, well, or in a good or comely or
pleasing manner, towards him; did good to him;
benefited him; conferred a benefit, or benefits,
upon him]: both signify the same: (S, TA:)
and hence, in the Kur [xii. 101], قَدْ أَحْسَنَ بِى
إِذَ أَخْرَجَنِى مِنَ السِّجْنِ meaning إِلَىَّ [i. e. He hath
acted well towards me, when he brought me forth
from the prison]: (AHeyth, Az:) or, accord. to
some, the verb in this case is made to import the
meaning of لَطَفَ [which is trans. by means of
بِ, i. e. He hath acted graciously with me].
(Mughnee in art. بِ.) ―
-b3-  الإِحْسَانُ is also explained
as meaning الإِخْلَاصُ [i. e. The being sincere, or
without hypocrisy; or the asserting oneself to be
clear of believing in any beside God]; which is
a condition of the soundness, or validity, of
الإِيمَان and الإِسْلَام together: and as denoting
watchfulness, and good obedience: and as meaning
the continuing in the right way, and following
the way which those [of the righteous] who have
gone before have trodden; this last being said to
be the meaning in the Kur ix. 101. (TA.)
-A2-
As a trans. v.: see 2, in three places. ―
-b2-  احسنهُ
also signifies (tropical:)  He knew it: (S, K, TA:) [or] he
knew it well; (Er-Rághib, Msb;) and so احسن بِهِ,
as in the saying, هُوَ يُحْسِنُ بِالعَرَبِيَّةِ (assumed tropical:)  He knows
well the Arabic language. (MA.) Hence the saying of 'Alee, قِيمَةُ المَرْءِ مَا يُحْسِنُهُ (tropical:)  [The value of
the man is what he knows, or knows well]. (TA.)
النَّاسُ أَبْنَآءُ مَا يُحْسِنُونَ is another saying of 'Alee,
meaning (tropical:)  Men are named, or reputed, in relation
to what they know, and to the good deeds that
they do. (TA.) ―
-b3-  أَحْسِنْ بِهِ and مَا أَحْسَنَهُ: see
1, last sentence. You say also, ↓ مَا أُحَيْسِنَهُ [i. e.
How very good, or goodly, &c., is he!]; using
the dim. form; like مَا أُمَيْلِحَهُ [q. v.]. (S and K
in art. ملح.)
-A3-  Also He (a man, IAar) sat upon
a high hill, or heap, of sand, such as is termed
حَسَنٌ. (IAar, K.)
5
تحسّن: see 1. ―
-b2-  Also i. q. تَجَمَّلَ [i. e. He
beautified, embellished, or adorned, himself: and
he affected what is beautiful, goodly, or comely,
in person, or in action or actions or behaviour, or
in moral character, &c.]. (TA.) [تَحَسَّنَتْ, said
of a woman, occurs, in the former sense, in the S
and K in art. رعد, and in the TA in art. نقط, &c.]
―
-b3-  دَخَلَ الحَمَّامَ فَتَحَسَّنَ He entered the hot bath
and was shaven. (TA.)
6
تحاسن [He affected to be حَسَن (i. e. good,
goodly, beautiful, comely, &c.), not being really
so]. (A in art. صبح. [See 6 in that art.])
10
استحسنهُ He counted, accounted, reckoned,
or esteemed, him, or it, حَسَن [i. e. good, goodly,
beautiful, comely, pleasing, &c.; he approved,
thought well of, or liked, him, or it]; (S, K;) as
also ↓ حسّنهُ, inf. n. تَحْسِينٌ. (Har p. 594.) Hence
the saying, صَرْفُ هٰذَا اسْتِحْسَانٌ وَ المَنْعُ قِيَاسٌ [The
making this word perfectly declinable is approvable, but the making it imperfectly declinable is
agreeable with analogy]. (TA.)
حُسْنٌ (S, K, &c.) and ↓ حُسُنٌ, which is of the
dial. of El-Hijáz, and ↓ حَسَنٌ, (MF, TA,) Goodness, or goodliness, [generally the latter,] beauty,
comeliness, or pleasingness; contr. of قُبْحٌ: (S:)
i. q. جَمَالٌ: (K:) but accord. to As, [when relating to the person,] حُسْنٌ is in the eyes, and
جَمَالٌ is in the nose: (TA:) symmetry; or just
proportion of the several parts of the person, one
to another: (Kull:) or anything, moving the
mind, that is desired, or wished for; such as is
approved by the intellect; and such as is approved
by natural desire; and such as is approved by
the faculty of sense: in the common conventional
language, mostly applied to what is approved by
the sight: in the Kur, mostly to what is approved
by mental perception: it is in accidents as well as
in substances: (Er-Rághib, TA:) the pl. is
↓ مَحَاسِنُ, (S, K,) like مَلَامِحُ pl. of لَمْحَةٌ, and
مَشَابِهُ pl. of شَبَهٌ, &c., (Har p. 9,) contr. to rule,
(S, K,) as though pl. of ↓ مَحْسَنٌ or ↓ مُحْسَنٌ:
(S accord. to different copies:) or, accord. to Lh
and Eth-Tha'álibee, مَحَاسِنُ has no proper sing.
(TA.) وَ قُولُوا لِلنَّاسِ حُسْنًا, in the Kur [ii. 77],
means And say ye to men a saying having in it
goodness (قَوْلًا ذَا حُسْنٍ): or حُسْنًا may mean حَسَنًا:
(Zj, TA:) and some read here حَسَنًا: and some,
حُسُنًا, accord. to the dial. of El-Hijáz: and some,
↓ حُسْنَى, as an inf. n., like بُشْرَى: (Bd:) but
AHát and Zj disallow this; the former saying
that حُسْنَى is like فُعْلَى [as fem. of أَفْعَلُ denoting
the comparative and superlative degrees], and
therefore should have the article ال. (TA.)
وَ وَصَّيْنَا الإِنْسَانَ بِوَالِدَيْهِ حُسْنًا, in the Kur [xxix. 7],
means [in like manner] And we have enjoined
man to do to his two parents what is good (مَا
يَحْسُنُ حُسْنًا): (TA:) and here [also] some read
حَسَنًا; and some, إِحْسَانًا. (Bd.) [See another ex.
of a similar kind, from the Kur xviii. 85, voce
إِمَّا, near the beginning of the paragraph.] ―
-b2-
سِتُّ الحُسْنِ [The convolvulus caïricus of Linn.;
abundant in the gardens of Cairo;] a certain
plant that twines about trees and has a beautiful
flower. (TA.) ―
-b3-  See also حَسَنٌ.
حَسَنٌ Having, or possessing, the quality termed
حُسْنٌ [which see above; good, or goodly, (generally the latter,) beautiful, comely, pleasing or
pleasant, &c.]; (Msb, K, TA;) either intrinsically, as when applied to belief in God and in his
attributes; or extrinsically, as when applied to war
against unbelievers, for this is not good in itself: said
to be the only epithet of its measure except بَطَلٌ:
(TA:) and ↓ حَسِينٌ signifies the same, (IB, K,)
because from حَسُنَ, like عَظِيمٌ and كَريِمٌ from
عَظُمَ and كَرُمَ, (IB, TA,) and ↓ حُسَانٌ, (K,) but
this is an intensive epithet, [signifying very good or
goodly &c.,] (IB, TA,) and ↓ حُسَّانٌ, (K,) also an
intensive epithet, (S, IB,) and ↓ حَاسِنٌ, (K,) [properly signifying being, or becoming, good or goodly
&c.,] cited by Lh as used in a future sense, (TA,)
and ↓ مُحَسَّنٌ as applied to a face: (K:) the fem.
is حَسَنَةٌ, and ↓ حَسْنَآءُ, applied to a woman, (S,
Msb, K,) though the corresponding masc. of this
latter, namely, ↓ أَحْسَنُ, is [said to be] not used (S,
K) as applied to a man [in the sense of حَسَنٌ],
(S,) [but the phrase هُوَ أَحْسَنُهُمْ وَجْهًا as meaning
حَسَنُهُمْ وَجْهًا is mentioned in the S in art. بيض,
(see بَيَاضٌ, and see also the pl. أَحَاسِنُ in what
here follows,)] and ↓ حُسَّانَةٌ: (S, K:) the pl. masc.
is حِسَانٌ, (Msb, K,) pl. of حَسَنٌ used as an epithet; but when حَسَنٌ is used as a [proper] name,
its pl. is حَسَنُونَ; (Msb;) and حِسَانٌ may also
be pl. of حَسِينٌ; (TA;) and حُسَّانُونَ, (Sb, K,)
pl. of ↓ حُسَّانٌ, which has no broken pl.: (Sb:)
and أَحَاسِنُ القَوْمِ means حِسَانُهُمْ [the good, or
goodly, &c., of the party, or company of men]:
(K:) the pl. fem. is حِسَانٌ, (K,) like the masc.,
pl. of حَسْنَآءُ, and the only instance of its kind except عِجَافٌ, pl. of عَجْفَآءُ. (TA.) You say رَجُلٌ
حَسَنٌ بَسَنٌ [A man very good or goodly &c.],
using بسن as an imitative sequent [for the purpose
of corroboration]. (S.) ―
-b2-  [حَدِيثٌ حَسَنٌ A tradition of good authority; generally applied to one
transmitted in the first instance by two or more
relaters. ―
-b3-  Also meaning Good, comely, goodhumoured, pleasing, or pleasant, discourse or
talk.] ―
-b4-  الحَسَنُ The bone that is next to the
elbow; as also ↓ الحُسْنُ: (K:) or the extremity
of the bone of the upper half of the arm next the
shoulder-joint, because of the abundance of flesh
that is upon it; the extremity of that bone next
the elbow being called القَبِيحُ: (TA in art. قبح:)
or the upper part of that bone; the lower part
thereof being called القبيح. (Fr, TA in that art.)
―
-b5-  A kind of tree, of beautiful appearance, (K,
TA,) also called the أَلآء, that grows in rows upon
a hill, or heap, (كَثِيب,) of sand; so called because of its beauty; whence the كثيب is called
نَقَا الحَسَنِ: thus described by Az, on the authority
of 'Alee Ibn-Hamzeh. (TA.) ―
-b6-  [And hence,
perhaps,] حَسَنٌ signifies also A high كَثِيب [or
hill, or heap, of sand]: (IAar, K:) whence it is
used as a [proper] name of a boy. (IAar, TA.)
-A2-  See also حُسْنٌ, first sentence.

-b2-
Also, [used as a subst., or as an epithet in which
the quality of a subst. is predominant, A good
act or action;] an act of obedience [to God;
often particularly applied to an alms-deed]: (Ksh
and Bd in iv. 80:) and the reward [of a good
action]: (Er-Rághib, TA:) a good, benefit, benefaction, boon, or blessing: (Ksh and Bd ibid.:)
contr. of سَيِّئَةٌ [in all these senses]: (S, K:) as
contr. of this latter word, it signifies any rejoicing,
or gladdening, good or benefit &c. that betides a
man in his soul and his body and his circumstances: (Er-Rághib, TA:) pl. حَسَنَاتٌ: (K, and
Kur vii. 167, &c.:) it has no broken pl. (TA.)
Hence, in the Kur iv. 80, it means Abundance of
herbage, or of the goods, conveniences, and comforts, of life; ampleness of circumstances; and
success: and سَيِّئَة there means the contr. of these.
(Er-Rághib, TA.) In the Kur xi. 116, الحَسَنَات
is said to mean The five daily prayers, as expiating what has been between them. (TA.) ―
-b3-
As an epithet, [fem. of حَسَنٌ,] it is applied to
an accident as well as to a substance. (Er-Rághib,
TA.)

case: so in the saying, حُسَيْنَاهُ أَنْ يَفْعَلَ كَذَا
[His utmost, or best, &c., is, or will be, the doing
such a thing]: and ↓ حُسَيْنَاؤُهُ means the same.

أَحْسَنُ, fem. حَسْنَآءُ, pl. أَحَاسِنُ: see حَسَنٌ. ―
-b2-
الأَحْسَنُ denotes the comparative and superlative
degrees [of حُسْنٌ]; as in the phrase هُوَ الأَحْسَنُ
[He, or it, is the better, and best; or the more,
and most, goodly or beautiful or comely &c.]:
(K:) ↓ الحُسْنَى is the fem.; as in the phrase
الأَسْمَآءُ الحُسْنَى The best names; those of God;
which are ninety and nine: (Jel in vii. 179:)
it signifies the contr. of السُّوْءَى: (S, K:) the pl.
of الأَحْسَنُ is الأَحَاسِنُ. (K.) In the saying, in
the Kur [vi. 153 and xvii. 36], وَ لَا تَقْرَبُوا مَالَ اليَتِيمِ
إِلَّا بِالَّتِى هِىَ أَحْسَنُ [And approach ye not the
property of the orphan, to make use of it,] except
by that act which is best to be done with it, the
meaning is, such an act as the taking care of it,
and increasing it: (Bd:) or, as some say, the
meaning is, the taking, of his property, what will
[suffice to] conceal those parts of one's person
that should not be exposed, and stay one's hunger.
(TA.) [The fem.] ↓ الحُسْنَى is applied to accidents only: not to substances. (Er-Rághib, TA.)
It means also, [as an epithet in which the quality
of a subst. predominates, That which is better,
and that which is best. And hence,] The good
final or ultimate state or condition [appointed
for the faithful]: (K:) so, it is said, in the Kur
xli. 50. (TA.) And The view, or vision, of God;
(K;) accord. to some: but it is said that in the Kur
x. 27, it means Paradise; and زِيَادَةٌ, which there
follows it, means the view, or vision, of the face
of God. (TA.) And Victory: and martyrdom:
(Th, K:) whence, [in the Kur ix. 52,] إِحْدَى

victory or martyrdom. (Ksh, Bd, Jel.) And
The saying لَا إِلَاهَ إِلَّا اللّٰهُ. (Jel in xcii. 6 and 9.)
The pl. of ↓ الحُسْنَى is الحُسْنَيَاتُ and ↓ الحُسَنُ,
(K, [the latter like رُجَعٌ pl. of رُجْعَى, but misunderstood by Freytag as syn. with المَحَاسِنُ,
which next follows it in the K,]) neither of which
is used without the article ال. (TA.)

مُحْسَنٌ: see حُسْنٌ.
مُحْسِنٌ Doing, or who does, that which is

TA;) as also ↓ مِحْسَانٌ: (K:) or the latter [is
an intensive epithet, meaning doing, or who does,
much that is good, comely, or pleasing: or]
means constantly doing that which is حَسَن.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  إِنَّا نَرَاكَ مِنَ المُحْسِنِينَ, in the Kur
xii. 36, means (tropical:)  Verily we see thee to be of those

prisoners: (Ksh, Bd:) or of those who aid the
weak and the sufferer of wrong, and visit the
sick. (TA.)

like as مَسَاوٍ, originally مَسَاوِئُ, is said to be pl.
of مَسَآءَةٌ, originally مَسْوَأَةٌ]. You say, هٰذَا الطَّعَامُ
مَحْسَنَةٌ لِلْجِسْمِ [This food is a cause of good,
i. e. beneficial, to the body]. (S.)
مُحَسَّنٌ: see حَسَنٌ.
مِحْسَانٌ: see مُحْسِنٌ.
مَحَاسِنُ The beautiful places [or parts] of the
body: (K:) accord. to some, (TA,) the sing.
is ↓ مَحْسَنٌ: or it has no sing.: (K:) the former
opinion is disapproved by ISd.: the latter is the
opinion of the grammarians and of the generality
of the lexicologists: and therefore, says Sb, the
rel. n. is ↓ مَحَاسِنِىٌّ; for if مَحَاسِنُ had a sing.,
it would be restored to the sing. in forming the
rel. n. (TA.) You say, فُلَانَةُ كَثِيرَةُ المَحَاسِنِ
Such a woman has many beautiful places [or
parts] of the body. (TA.) And مَحَاسِنُ الوَجْهِ
وَ مَسَاوِيهِ [The beauties of the face, and its defects]:
