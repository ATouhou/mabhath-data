(S, O, K;) i. e., (S, O, but in the K “ or ”) a
turning of one of the great toes towards the
other: (S, O, K:) or [a distortion that causes]

to an explanation of ↓ أَحْنَفُ by IAar cited in the
S:]) or an inclining [app. inwards] in the fore
part of the foot. (Lth, K.) ―
-b2-  Accord. to Ibn-
'Arafeh and the K, it signifies also A right state
or condition or tendency; and accord. to the
former, the epithet ↓ أَحْنَفُ is applied to him who
has a wry leg, or foot, only by way of presaging
a right state: but Er-Rághib explains حَنَفٌ better,
as signifying an inclining, from error, to a right
state or tendency. (TA.)

Imám Aboo-Haneefeh [because they hold his
tenets]; as also ↓ أَحْنَافٌ. (TA.) حَنَفِىٌّ [is its
n. un.: and] signifies [also] one who is of the
religion of Abraham. (Mgh. [See also حَنِيفٌ.])
-A2-  A مِيضَأَة; [by which is here meant a vessel
with a tap, for the purpose of ablution, such as
is often used in a private house; and a fountain,
i. e. a tank with taps, for the same purpose, in a
mosque; because persons of the persuasion of
Aboo-Haneefeh must perform the ablution preparatory to prayer with running water, or from
a tank or the like at least ten cubits in breadth
and the same in depth;] but this application is
post-classical. (TA.)
-A3-  سُيُوفٌ حَنَفِيَّةٌ, (L, K, *
TA,) or ↓ حَنِيفِيَّةٌ, (so accord. to the CK,) or
حَنْفِيَّةٌ, (so in a MS. copy of the K,) Certain
swords, so called in relation to El-Ahnaf Ibn-
Keys; because he was the first who ordered to
make them: by rule it should be أَحْنَفِيَّةٌ. (Lth,
L, K.)
حَنِيفٌ Inclining to a right state or tendency:
(Er-Rághib, TA:) or right, or having a right
state or tendency; (Akh, S, TA;) thus applied
in like manner as أَعْوَرُ is applied to a crow: (S:)
[and particularly] inclining, from one religion,
to another: (Ham p. 358:) or inclining, from
any false religion, to the true religion: (Mgh:)
or inclining in a perfect manner to El-Islám,
and continuing firm therein: (K:) and any one
who has performed the pilgrimage: (As, K, TA:)
so say I'Ab and El-Hasan and Es-Suddee; and
Az says the like on the authority of Ed-Dahhák:
(TA:) or one who is of the religion of Abraham,
(K, TA,) in respect of making the Sacred House
[of Mekkeh] his kibleh, and of the rite of circumcision: (TA:) [and] a Muslim; (S, Mgh, Msb;)
because he inclines to the right religion: (Msb:)
but in this last sense, it is a conventional term of
the professors: (Mgh:) [or,] accord. to AO, the
worshipper of idols, in the Time of Ignorance,
called himself thus; and when El-Islám came,
they thus called the Muslim: accord. to Akh,
it was applied in the Time of Ignorance to him
who was circumcised, and who performed the
pilgrimage to the [Sacred] House; because the
Arabs in the Time of Ignorance held nothing of
the religion of Abraham except circumcision and
that pilgrimage: accord. to Ez-Zejjájee, it was
applied in the Time of Ignorance to him who
made the pilgrimage to the [Sacred] House and
performed the ablution on account of جَنَابَة and
was circumcised; and when El-Islám came, it
was applied to the Muslim, because of his turning
from the belief in a plurality of gods: (TA:)
also one who devotes himself to religious exercises;
or applies himself to devotion: (Msb:) its predominant application is to Abraham: (Mgh:)
pl. حُنَفَآءُ. (AO, TA.) ―
