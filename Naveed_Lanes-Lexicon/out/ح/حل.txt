حَلَّ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.
حَلُ3َ, inf. n. حَلٌّ,
(S, Mgh, Msb,) He untied, or undid, (K, TA,)
or opened, (S,) a knot: (S, Mgh, Msb, K:) this
is the primary signification. (Er-Rághib, TA.)
Hence, يَا عَاقِدُ اذْكُرْ حَلًّا [O tyer of a knot, bear
in mind the time of untying: or حَابِلُ O binder,
or tyer, of the rope: (see art. حبل:)] (S, TA:)
or, as IAar relates it, يا حَامِلُ [O loader]: a
prov., applied to the consideration of results; because a man may tie a load too tightly; and when
he desires to untie it, may injure himself and his
camel. (TA. [See also a similar saying below,
in the second paragraph.]) And الشُّفْعَةُ كَحَلِّ
العِقَالِ [The right of preemption is like the untying
of the cord with which a camel's fore shank and
arm are bound together]: meaning that it is
accomplished as quickly and easily as the عقال is
untied: the explanation that it passes away quickly,
like the camel when his عقال is untied, is improbable.
(Mgh, Msb. *) And hence the saying [in the Kur
xx. 28], وَ احْلُلْ عُقْدَةً مِنْ لِسَانِى (assumed tropical:)  [And loose Thou
an impediment of, or from, my tongue]. (Er-Rághib, TA.) The pass. is pronounced by some
حُلَّ, and by others حِلَّ: thus in the saying of
El-Farezdak,
فَمَا حِلَّ مِنْ جَهْلٍ حُبَى حُلَمَائِنَا
وَ لَا قَابِلُ المَعْرُوفِ فِينَا يُعَنَّفُ
[And the garments of our forbearing men by which
they support themselves in sitting by binding them,
or making them tight, round the shanks and back
are not loosed through ignorance, nor is the accepter of the benefit, among us, reproached]; the
kesreh of the first ل [in the original form حُلِلَ]
being transferred to the ح: but Akh heard it pronounced in this instance حُلَّ; and some, he says,
in this word, and in others like it, as رُدَّ and شُدَّ,
only impart to the dammeh somewhat of the sound
of kesreh, by the pronunciation termed إِشْمَام.

He alighted; or descended and stopped or sojourned or abode or lodged or settled; and simply
he took up his abode; or he abode, lodged, or
settled; in a place]. (Er-Rághib, TA.) You say,

(S, Mgh, * K) or البَلَدَ, (Msb,) aor.

meaning نَزَلَ بِهِ [He alighted, or descended and
stopped &c. (as above), in the place or the country
or town &c.]. (Msb, K, TA.) And in like

and بِهِمْ ↓ احتلّ and ↓ احتلّهُمْ (ISd, TA) [He
alighted, or descended and stopped &c., at, or in,
the abode of the people or party]; and حَلَّ إِلَى
القَوْم signifies the same. (TA.) And حُلَّ المَكَانُ
The place was alighted in, or taken as an abode;
(TA;) was inhabited. (K.) [Hence, in philosophy, حُلُولٌ signifies (assumed tropical:)  Temporary or separable,
and permanent or inseparable, indwelling or inbeing: and حَلَّ بِهِ or فِيهِ (assumed tropical:)  It had, or became in
the condition of having, such indwelling or inbeing

grief and the like, meaning (assumed tropical:)  It took up its abode
in him. And كَذَا ↓ حَلَّ مَحَلَّ (assumed tropical:)  It took, or occupied, the place of such a thing.] ―

different readings: (S, O:) or when you say,

Mgh, K,) immediately: (TA:) and مِنْهَا ↓ تحلّل
(assumed tropical:)  he became quit of it by expiation, (Mgh, TA,)
or by a violation of it requiring expiation, or by

due bounds in what he says, أَبَا فُلَانٍ ↓ حِلًّا, meaning (assumed tropical:)  Make thou an exception, or say ان شاء اللّٰه,

ذٰلِكَ أَنْ أَفْعَلَ كَذَا ↓ إِلَّا حِلَّ, [the particle] الّا is
syn. with لٰكِنَّ; and the meaning is said to be,
(assumed tropical:)  [I will assuredly do such a thing: but] the annulling of the obligation, or the expiation, of [that]
my asseveration (قَسَمِى ↓ تَحِلَّةَ, or تَحْلِيلَهُ,) shall
be my doing such a thing. (TA.) One says also,
القَسَمِ ↓ فَعَلْتُهُ تَحِلَّةَ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  I did it only
enough to annul the obligation of, or to expiate,
the oath; not exceeding therein the ordinary
bounds. (S, Msb.) It is said in a trad., لَا يَمُوتُ
القَسَمِ ↓ لِلْمُؤْمِنِ ثَلَاثَةُ أَوْلَادٍ فَتَمَسَّهُ النَّارُ إِلَّا تَحِلَّةَ,
meaning (assumed tropical:)  [Three children of the believer shall
not die and the fire of Hell touch him]. save
enough to annul the obligation of, or to expiate,
the oath that is implied in the saying in the Kur
[xix. 72], “There is not any of you that shall not
come to it. ” (A' Obeyd, S, TA.) Hence تَحْلِيلٌ
came to be applied to anything in which the ordinary bounds were not exceeded. (S, Msb.) One
says, ضَرَبْتُهُ تَحْلِيلًا, (S, TA,) or ضَرْبًا تَحْلِيلًا, (K,)
meaning (assumed tropical:)  I beat him moderately; not exceeding
the ordinary bounds. (K, * TA.) And Kaab Ibn-Zuheyr says, speaking of the feet of a she-camel,
وَقْعُهُنَّ الأَرْضَ تَحْلِيلُ, meaning Their falling on
the ground is without vehemence. (S.) [In like
manner, also,] القَسَمِ ↓ تَحِلَّةَ is descriptive, by way
of comparison, of littleness; as is اليَمِينِ ↓ تَحِلَّةَ:
(Mgh:) or of anything occupying little time:
(TA:) and القَسَمِ ↓ إِلَّا تَحِلَّةَ, in the trad. cited
above, means (assumed tropical:)  [slightly, or] with a slight touch.
(Mgh.) A poet says,

4. احلّهُ He made him to alight, or descend
and stop or sojourn or abide or lodge or settle;
and simply he made him to take up his abode,

↓ حللّٰهُ, and بِهِ ↓ حَلَّ: (K:) said also of a place
[as though meaning it invited him to alight, &c.].

alight, or descend and stop &c., in the place.
(K.) ―

S, Msb) made it lawful, allowable, or free; as
also ↓ حللّٰهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K, TA,) inf. n. تَحْلِيلٌ

lawful, or allowable, giving the choice to practise
it or abstain from it. (Msb.) And hence also,
