حوط1
حَاطَ بِهِ, aor. يَحُوطُ: see 4, in three places.
―
-b2-  حَاطَهُ, (S, Msb, K,) aor. as above, (S, Msb,)
inf. n. حَوْطٌ (S, Msb, K) and حِيطَةٌ and حِيَاطَةٌ,
(S, K, TA, [the second and third, in the CK,
erroneously, with fet-h to the ح, the former of
them being expressly said in the S and TA, and
the latter also in the TA, to be with kesr, and
both being shown in the S to be originally with و,
i. e. حِوْطَةٌ and حِوَاطَةٌ,]) and حِيَاطٌ is used in
poetry for the last of these; (TA;) and ↓ حوّطهُ,
(K,) inf. n. تَحْوِيطٌ; (TA;) and ↓ تحوّطهُ; (K,
TA; [omitted in the CK;]) He guarded, kept,
kept safely, protected, or took care of, him, or it;
(S, Msb, K, TA;) he defended him, or it; (TA;)
he paid frequent attention to him, or it; (K,
TA;) he minded, or was regardful of, the things
that were for his, or its, good. (TA.) You say,
لَا زِلْتَ فِى حِيَاطَةِ اللّٰهِ Mayest thou not cease to be
in the protection of God. (TA.) And مَعَ فُلَانٍ
حِيطَةٌ لَكَ There is with such a one compassion and
affection for thee: you should not say عَلَيْكَ.
(S.) And أَحُوطُ عِرْضِى [I guard, or defend, or
take care of, my honour, or reputation]. (TA.)
And أَخَاهُ ↓ هُوَ يَتَحَوَّطُ He takes care of, or pays
frequent attention to, his brother; and undertakes, or superintends, or manages, his affairs.
(TA.) And حَاطَهُمْ قَصَآءَهُمْ and بِقَصَائِهِمْ He
fought in their defence. (TA.) [But this is generally meant ironically.] When an affliction
befalls thee, and thy brother does not guard thee,
or defend thee, and does not aid thee, one says
[to thee], حَاطَكَ الفَضَآءَ [so in the TA, app. a
mistranscription for القَصَآءَ or القَصَا, with which,
however, it is nearly syn.,] which is used ironically; i. e. He guarded thee,  or defended thee, in
a distant quarter; meaning, (tropical:)  he did not guard
thee, or defend thee; for he who guards, or defends, his brother, draws near to him, and supports
him, or aids him. (A, TA.) [See also 1 in art.
حبو.] You say also, حَاطُونَا القَصَآءَ, (K,) or القَصَا,
(TK,) [both are said to be correct in the TA in
art. قصو, on the authority of Ibn-Wellád,] in
some of the copies of the K with ف and ض, and
in some with ف and ض, the latter unpointed, and
so in [a copy of] the A, (TA,) (tropical:)  They retired to
a distance from us, they being around us, and we
not being distant from them, had they desired to
come to us. (K, TA.) And حُطْنِى القَصَا (tropical:)  Retire
thou to a distance from me; (Ibn-Wellád, and
K in art. قصو;) as also القَصَآءَ. (Ibn-Wellád, and
TA in that art.) And لَأَحُوطَنَّكَ القَصَا وَلَأَغْزُوَنَّكَ
بِالعَصَا, in each case with the short & ا, meaning
I will assuredly leave thee, and not go near thee;
[and I will assuredly go against thee to fight thee
with the staff.] (Ks, TA in art. قصو.) حُطْ حُطْ
means Take thou care of the tie of kindred, and
preserve it. (IAar, K. *) It also signifies Deck
thou the boys (الصِّبْيَة [in the CK الصَّبِيَّة the girl])
with the حَوْط [for preservation from the evil eye].
(IAar, K.) And حُوطُوا غُلَامَكُمْ Deck ye your boy
with the حَوْط. (AA.) ―
-b3-  حَاطَ الحِمَارُ عَانَتَهُ, (S, *
Msb, K,) nor, as above, (S, Msb,) inf. n. حَوْطٌ,
(Msb,) The [wild] he-ass collected, or drew together, (S, * Msb, K, *) and guarded, or took care
of, (TA,) his عَانَة [app. meaning his herd of wild
asses: or the phrase may mean the he-ass drew
towards himself, or compressed, and guarded, his
she-ass: Freytag here renders عانة by “ pubem; ”
and Golius, by “ veretrum ”]. (S, Msb, K.)
2
حوّط حَوْلَهُ, inf. n. تَحْوِيطٌ, He surrounded it
by some such thing as earth, so as to make this to
encompass it. (Msb.) And حوّط كَرْمَهُ, inf. n.
as above, He built a حَائِط [or wall] around his
vine. (S.) ―
-b2-  Hence, أَنَا أُحَوِّطُ ذٰلِكَ الأَمْرُ
(tropical:)  I have within my compass, or power, and care,
that thing, or affair; [like أُحَوِّضُ, q. v.;] syn.
أَدُورُ. (S, TA.) [Hence also, حوّط عَلَيْهِ, in the
present day, is used to signify (assumed tropical:)  He monopolized
it. See also 4.] ―
-b3-  حوّط حَائِطًا, (K,) inf. n. as
above, (TA,) He made a حائط [meaning either
a walled garden or a wall; app. a wall of enclosure]; (K, TA;) as also ↓ احاطهُ. (IDrd, TA.)
―
-b4-  See also 1.
3
حاوط فُلَانًا (tropical:)  He endeavoured to induce such
a one to turn, or incline; or endeavoured to turn
him by deceit, or guile; (دَاوَرَهُ;) in a matter that
he desired of him, and which he refused him:
(K:) as though each of them were guarding, or
taking care of, (يَحُوطُ,) the other. (K: and so in
the A, in illustration of what next follows.)
حَاوِطْهُ فَإِنَّهُ يَلِينُ لَكَ (tropical:)  Endeavour thou to induce
him to turn, or incline; or endeavour thou to turn
him by deceit, or guile; [for he will relent to thee;]
syn. دَاوِرْهُ. (A, TA.)
4
احاط بِهِ and
بِهِ ↓ حَاطَ signify the same [i. e.
It, or he, surrounded, encompassed, environed,
enclosed, or hemmed in, it, or him]. (TA.) You
say, احاط القَوْمُ بِالبَلَدِ, inf. n. إِحَاطَةٌ; and ↓ حَاطُوا
بِهِ; The people surrounded, encompassed, environed, encircled, or beset, the sides of the town.
(Msb.) And احاطت الخَيْلُ بِفُلَانٍ, (S, TA,) and
به ↓ حَاطَتْ, (TA,) and به ↓ احتاطت, (S,) The
horses, or horsemen, surrounded, encompassed,
environed, encircled, or beset, such a one. (S,
TA.) [And احاطوا بِهِ مِنْ جَانِبَيْهِ, meaning They
surrounded him on all his sides; lit. on his two
sides: see جَنْبٌ.] ―
-b2-  It is said in the Kur
[xvii. 62], إِنَّ رَبَّكَ أَحَاطَ بِالنَّاسِ (assumed tropical:)  Verily thy Lord
hath men in his grasp, or power: (Bd, TA:) or
(assumed tropical:)  hath destroyed them; meaning Kureysh. (Bd.)
You say also, أُحِيطَ بِفُلَانٍ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  Such a one
was destroyed: or (assumed tropical:)  his destruction drew near.
(TA.) And hence the saying in the Kur [xviii. 40],
وَأُحِيطَ بِثَمَرِهِ (assumed tropical:)  And its fruit became smitten by that
which destroyed and spoiled it: (TA:) or (assumed tropical:)  his
possessions became destroyed: from أَحَاطَ بِهِ العَدُوُّ

over whom his sin hath gained the mastery, affecting all the circumstances of his case, so that
he hath become as though he were entirely encompassed thereby: (Bd:) or (assumed tropical:)  who hath died in the
belief of a plurality of Gods. (TA.) You also
say, احاط بِهِ الأَمْرُ (assumed tropical:)  The thing beset him on every
side, so that he had no place of escape from it.
(TA.) And احاط عَلَيْهِ (assumed tropical:)  He took it entirely to
himself, debarring others from it: [see also 2.]
(TA in art شرب.) ―
-b3-  احاط بِهِ, (K,) or احاط بِهِ عِلْمًا,
(S, Msb, TA,) and احاط بِهِ عِلْمُهُ, (S, TA,) (tropical:)  [He
comprehended it, or knew it altogether, in all its
modes or circumstances;] he knew it extrinsically
and intrinsically; (Msb;) or he attained the utmost particular thereof, and had a comprehensive
and complete knowledge thereof: or he attained
everything [relating to it], and the utmost knowledge thereof. (K, accord. to different copies. [In
the CK, اَحْصٰى عِلْمُهُ is put, erroneously, for
احصى عِلْمَهُ.]) It is said in the Kur [xxvii. 22],
أَحَطْتُ بِمَا لَمْ تُحِطْ بِهِ (tropical:)  I have known in all its
circumstances, or modes, that which thou hast not

-b2-  Also (tropical:)  He took the course
prescribed by prudence, precaution, or good judgment; he used precaution; he took the sure
course; (S, * K, * TA;) لِنَفْسِهِ for himself; (S,
TA;) [and مِنَ الشَّىْءِ against the thing:] he sought
the most successful means, and took the surest
method; لِلشَّىْءِ for [the accomplishment, or attainment, of] the thing. (Msb.) The subst. [denoting the abstract signification of the inf. n.,
اِحْتِيَاطٌ,] is حيطة, (Msb,) i. e. ↓ حَيْطَةٌ and ↓ حِيطَةٌ,
(K, TA,) which latter is originally حِوْطَةٌ, (TA,)
[and is also an inf. n. of 1,] and ↓ حَوْطَةٌ. (K,
TA.) Some hold احتياط to belong to art. حيط.
(Msb.) You say also فِى الأُمُورِ ↓ استحاط [meaning in like manner (assumed tropical:)  He took the course prescribed by prudence, &c., in affairs, or in the
affairs: as is shown below: see مُحْتَاطٌ]. (TA.)

إِسْتَحْوَطَ see 8.
حَوْطٌ A twisted string of two colours, black and
red, (IAar, K,) called بَرِيم, (IAar,) upon which
are beads and a crescent of silver, which a woman
binds upon her waist, [and which is bound upon
a boy, (see 1,)] in order that the evil eye may not
smite her [or him]: (IAar, K:) and also the
crescent above mentioned; as well as the string
with it. (TA.) [See also تَحْوِيطَةٌ.]
حَوْطَةٌ: see 8.
حَيْطَةٌ: see 8.
حِيطَةٌ: see 8.
حُوَاطٌ: see what next follows.
حُوَاطَةٌ An enclosure (حَظِيرَة) made for wheat:
(S, K:) or it signifies a thing which one soon
quits, or relinquishes, or from which one soon abstains; and so ↓ حُوَاطٌ, as occurring [accord. to
one relation] in a verse cited voce عُرْسٌ. (L.)
حَيِّطٌ, [originally either حَوِيطٌ or حَيْوِطٌ,] like سَيِّدٌ,
A man who guards, protects, or defends, (يَحُوطُ,)
his family and his brethren. (TA.)
[
حَوَّاطٌ A monopolizer: so in the present day.]
حَوَّاطُ أَمْرٍ (tropical:)  The undertakers, superintendents,
or managers, of an affair. (K, TA.) [See a
verse cited voce عُرْسٌ.]
حَائِطٌ A wall. (Msb, * K, TA:) or a wall of
enclosure: (Msb, * TA:) or one that surrounds
a garden: (Mgh:) [often applied to a fence of
wood, or sticks, or of reeds, or canes:] so called
because it surrounds what is within it; (TA;)
but it is a subst., like سَقْفٌ and رُكْنٌ, though
implying the meaning of surrounding: (IJ, TA:)
or it is an act. part. n., from حَاطَ: (Msb:) pl.
حِيطَانٌ, (S, Msb, K,) in which the و is changed
into ى because of the kesreh before it, (S,) but
by rule it should be حُوطَانٌ; (Sb, K;) and حِيَاطٌ.
(IAar, K.) ―
-b2-  And hence, (Mgh,) A garden,
(Mgh, Msb, K,) in general: or a garden of palmtrees, surrounded by a wall: (TA:) pl. حَوَائِطُ.
(Msb, TA.)
اِفْعَلِ الأَحْوَطَ (assumed tropical:)  Do thou that which is most
comprehensive in relation to the principles of the
ordinances [applying to the case], (مَا هُوَ أَجْمَعُ
لِأُصُولِ الأَحْكَامِ,) and furthest from the sophistications of interpretations not according to the
obvious meanings. (Msb.) And هٰذَا أَحْوَطُ (assumed tropical:)  This
is more, or most, conducive to put [one] in a
position of اِحْتِيَاط [or taking the course prescribed
by prudence, precaution, or good judgment; &c.:
see 8]. (Mgh.) The word أَحْوَطُ is from the
phrase حَاطَ الحِمَارُ عَانَتَهُ; not from الاِحْتِيَاطُ;
because the افعل of excess is not formed from a
verb of five letters: (Msb:) or it is anomalous,
like أَخْصَرُ from الاِخْتِصَارُ. (Mgh.) [It may be
rendered More, or most, prudent: or more, or
most, sure.]
تَحُوطُ and التَّحُوطُ &c.: see what next follows.
تُحِيطُ and ↓ تَحُوطُ (ISk, TS, K) and تَحِيطُ and

التَّحِيطُ (L, K) [and ↓ تَحَوُّط and ↓ تحوَّط (mentioned, with the third and fourth, in Freytag's
Arab. Prov., ii. 803, as on the authority of Fr,)]
(tropical:)  The year of dearth, scarcity, or straitness, that
destroys the beasts, (Fr, K, * TA,) or men: (A,
TA:) تَحُوطُ being from حَاطَ بِهِ in the sense of
أَحَاطَ; or it is used as a term of good omen;
accord. to the A. (TA.) You say, وَقَعُوا فِى
تُحِيطَ, &c., [the last word being a noun imperfectly decl., (tropical:)  They fell into the affliction of a
year of dearth, &c.] (ISk, TA.)
تَحْويِطَةٌ A thing that is hung upon a boy to
repel the evil eye: of the dial. of El-Yemen.
(TA.) [See also حَوْطٌ.]
مَحَاطٌ A place behind the camels or other beasts
and the people [to whom they belong], surrounding and protecting them: (K:) some say that
أَرْضٌ مَحَاطٌ signifies land surrounded by a wall:
if not so surrounded, it is termed ضَاحِيَةٌ. (TA.)
فُلَانٌ مُحَاطٌ بِهِ (assumed tropical:)  Such a one is slain; is destroyed. (TA.)
مُحِيطٌ [act. part. n. of 4; Surrounding, encompassing, or enclosing: &c.] ―
-b2-  It is said in
the Kur [lxxxv. 20], وَاللّٰهُ مِنْ وَرَائِهِمْ مُحيِطٌ (assumed tropical:)  And

(TA.) And again, [xi. 85,] عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ مُحِيطٍ
(assumed tropical:)  The punishment of a day which shall beset on
every side so that there shall be no place of escape
from it: (TA:) or of a destructive day: meaning the day of resurrection: or the punishment
[of a day] of extermination: the epithet, which
is that of the punishment, being applied to the
day because it includes it. (Bd.) And again,
[ii. 18,] وَاللّٰهُ مُحِيطٌ بِالكَافِرِينَ, explained by Mujá-
hid as signifying (assumed tropical:)  And God will collect together
the unbelievers on the day of resurrection. (TA.)
كَرْمٌ مُحوَّطٌ A vine having a wall built around
it. (S.)
هُوَ مُحْتَاطٌ فِى أَمْرِهِ and فِيهِ ↓ مُسْتَحِيطٌ [He is
taking the course prescribed by prudence, precaution, or good judgment; or using precaution;
or taking the sure course; or seeking the most
successful means, and taking the surest method;
in his affair: see 8]. (TA.)
مُسْتَحِيطٌ: see what next precedes.
يَحِيطٌ: see تُحِيطٌ.
