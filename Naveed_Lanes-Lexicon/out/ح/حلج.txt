(S and K in art.حلزن,) that is found upon the
[kind of tree called] رِمْث: (S, K:) or of the kind
called أَصْدَاف [i. e. of the testaceous kind, or
shell-kind: applied in the present day to the snail
with its shell, and to any kind of spiral shell]:
(K:) it is a kind of worm, having a shell within
which it conceals itself: (TA in art. حلزن:) its
flesh is good for the stomach, and for the wound
of the mad dog, and for dissolving hard tumours,
and curing ulcers; its shell, burnt, clears the
mange, or scab, and the [species of leprosy termed]
بَهَق [q. v.], and the teeth; and the application
of it externally draws forth the سَلَا [or perhaps
it should be سُلَّآء (or prickles of the palm-tree)]
from within the flesh, and, mixed with vinegar,
stops bleeding from the nose: (K in art. حلزن:)
Az agrees with the author of the K in mentioning
this as a triliteral-radical word; but As and J
hold the ن to be a radical letter, (TA in art.
حلز,) and so do Lth and A 'Obeyd. (TA in art.
حلزن.)
