حرش1
حَرَشَ الضَّبَّ, (S, A, K,) aor.
حَرِشَ, inf. n. حَرْشٌ
(S, K) and تَحْرَاشٌ, (K,) He hunted, or sought
to capture or catch, or captured or caught, the
[lizard called] ضبّ; syn. صَادَهُ; (S, A, K;) by
moving about his hand at its hole, (S, K,) at
the entrance thereof, (K,) in order that it might
imagine it to be a serpent, and put forth its tail
to strike it, whereupon he would seize it; (S, K;)
as also ↓ احترشهُ: (A, K:) or, as also ↓ احترشهُ,
and ↓ تحرّشهُ, and بِهِ ↓ تحرّش, he traced its hole,
and made a noise with his staff, or stick, at it,
and inserted the end of this into the hole, and
the ضبّ, hearing the sound, thought it to be a
beast desiring to come in upon it, so it came
backwards upon its feet and kinder part, fighting, and striking with its tail, whereupon the
man hastened with it, and seized it firmly by its
tail, and it was unable to escape from him.
(TA.) And hence, He hunted, or sought to
capture, or captured, the ضبّ in any manner.
(Ham p. 61.) Hence also the saying, لَهُوَ أَخْبَثُ
مِنْ ضَبٍّ حَرَشْتَهُ [Verily he is worse than a ضبّ
which thou hast hunted]: for sometimes the ضبّ
scents [its pursuer], and circumvents [him], and
cannot be caught. (TA.) And hence the prov.,
alluding to one's discoursing to a learned man
with the desire of instructing him, أَتُعْلِمُنِى بِضَبٍّ
أَنَا حَرَشْتُهُ [Dost thou acquaint me with a ضبّ
which I have captured?]. (A 'Obeyd, Az.) Hence
also the prov., هٰذَاأَجَلُّ مِنَ الحَرْشِ [This is a
greater matter than the hunting, or capturing, of
the ضبّ]: (M, A, K:) originating in one of
their fables, to the effect that a ضبّ said to its
young one, “O my little son, beware thou of
الحَرْش: ” and the young one heard, one day,
the fall of a digging-implement upon the mouth
of the hole; so he said, “O my father, is this
الحَرْش? ” to which his father answered, “O my
little son, this is a greater matter than الحَرْش: ”
(M, K: *) and it became a prov., which is applied
to him who fears a thing and falls into that which
is more severe. (M.) [Hence also the saying,]
ضَبَّ العَدَاوَةِ بَيْنَهُمْ ↓ اِحْتَرَشَ (tropical:)  [He roused the
rancour of enmity between them]. (TA.) ―
