The court, or yard, in front, or extending from
the sides, of a house, or an abode.])

of swearing]: they are two stars that rise before
Canopus (Suheyl); and when either of them
rises, it is thought to be Canopus, because of
their resemblance to it: (AA, S: *) they are
termed محلفان because of the disagreement of
their beholders when they rise; one swearing
that the one rising is Canopus, and another
swearing that it is not. (AA, TA.) Th says
that it is a dim, distant, star; and cites this
verse:
أَرَي نَارَ لَيْلَى بَالعَقِيقِ كَأَنَّهَا
حَضَارِ إِذَا مَا أَعْرَضَتْ وَفُرُودُهَا

or, accord. to AAF and the M and K, the foremost, or preceding, portion of an army: and
