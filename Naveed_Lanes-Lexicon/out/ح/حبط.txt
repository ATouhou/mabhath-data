حبط1
حَبِطَ, aor.
حَبَطَ, inf. n. حَبَطٌ, (Az, S, K, &c.,)
He (a beast, Az, S, or a camel, ISd, K) ate
much, (S,) or had pain in his belly from pasture
which he found unwholesome, or from eating
much of herbage, (ISd, K,) so that he became
swollen, or inflated, thereby (S, ISd, K) in his
belly, (S,) and there would not come forth from
him (S, ISd, K) what was in it, (S,) or anything;
(ISd, K;) he did not void either thin dung or
urine, his belly being bound: (Az:) or he (a
sheep, or goat, ISk, S) became swollen, or inflated,
in his belly, in consequence of eating [the herb
called] ذُرَق, (ISk, S, K, *) which is the حَنْدَ قُوق
[i. e. the herb lotus, melilot, or bird's-foot-trefoil]:
(ISk, S:) or he (a beast) lighted upon good pasturage, and ate immoderately, so that he became
swollen, or inflated, and died: (Z, IAth:) or, in
speaking of a horse, you do not say, حَبِطَ الفَرَسُ, but
حَبِطَ قُصَيْرَى الفَرَسِ, or خَاصِرَتُهُ, or مَوْقِفُهُ, because
it means that the horse's belly became swollen, or
inflated: (ISd, Z, L:) you say also, حَبِطَ بَطْنُهُ
his belly became swollen, or inflated, so that he
died: (Az, TA:) or his (a man's) belly became
swollen, or inflated, by food &c.: (Mbr, TA in
art. حبطأ:) and حَبِطَ is also said of the skin,
meaning it became swollen, or inflated. (TA.)
[See also Q. Q. 3; and see حَبَطٌ below.] ―
-b2-
Hence, app., i. e. from حَبِطَ said of the belly,
(Az, TA,) or it is from this verb said of a beast,
(Z, IAth, TA,) حَبِطَ عَمَلُهُ, (Az, S, Msb, K, &c.,)
aor.
حَبَطَ; (Az, Msb, K;) and حَبَطَ, aor.
حَبِطَ; (AZ,
Az, Msb, K;) the latter, says Az, heard by AZ
from an Arab of the desert, but I have not heard
it on any other authority; (TA;) inf. n. حَبْطٌ,
(Az, S, K, [but in the Msb it seems to be indicated that it is حَبَطٌ,]) with the ب quiescent,
(Az, S,) thus differing from the inf. n. of حَبِطَ
said of the belly, (Az, TA,) and حُبُوطٌ, (Az, S,
Msb, K,) which latter, accord. to AZ, is the
inf. n. of حَبَطَ like ضَرَبَ; (T, TA;) (tropical:)  His work,
or deed, became null, or void, or of no account;
it went for nothing; it perished; (Az, Msb, TA;)
for like as he of whom one says حَبِطَ بَطْنُهُ
perishes, so does the work, or deed, of the hypocrite: (Az, TA:) or it became ineffective of
reward; its reward became annulled. (S, K.)
And hence also, (Z, TA,) حَبِطَ دَمُهُ, aor.
حَبَطَ, (Z,
Msb, K, TA,) but not حَبَطَ also, as is implied in
the K, (TA,) and in this case the inf. n. is حَبَطٌ,
(Msb, * TA,) with the ب movent, (TA,) (tropical:)  His
blood (the blood of one slain, K) went for
nothing; unretaliated, and uncompensated by a
mulct. (Msb, K, TA.) ―
-b3-  حَبِطَ said of the water
of a well, i. q. أَحْبَطَ, q. v. (TA.) ―
-b4-  Said of a
wound, (S, Ibn-' Abbád, K,) aor.
حَبَطَ, (K,) inf. n.
حَبَطٌ, with fet-h to the ب, (S, K,) It had scars
remaining after having healed: (Ibn-' Abbád,
K: *) or it broke open again; or became recrudescent; syn. عَرِبَ [which has the signification
given above on the authority of Ibn-' Abbád as
well as what follows it] and نُكِسَ. (S.) [See also
حَبَطٌ below.]

أَحْبَطَ [احبطهُ seems to signify, in its primary
acceptation, He made him, (namely a beast,) or
it, (the belly,) to be in the state termed حَبَطٌ,
which see below. ―
-b2-  And hence,] احبط عَمَلَهُ
(tropical:)  He (God, S, K, or a man, Msb) made his work,
or deed, to become null, or void, or of no account;
to go for nothing; to perish; (Msb, K, * TA;)
to be ineffective of reward; or he annulled its
reward. (S.) So it signifies in the Kur [xxxiii. 19,
&c.]: and you say, إِنْ عَمِلَ عَمَلًا صَالِحًا أَتْبَعَهُ مَا
يُحْبِطُهُ وَ إِنْ أَرْسَلَ كَلِمًا طَيِّبًا أَرْسَلَ خَلْفَهُ مَا يُحْبِطُهُ
(tropical:)  [If he do a good deed, he makes to follow it that
which annuls it; and if he send forth good words,
he sends forth after them that which annuls them].
(TA.) And hence also, (Z, TA,) احبط الدَّمَ (tropical:)  He
made the blood to go for nothing; unretaliated,
and uncompensated by a mulct. (Msb, K, * TA. *)
―
-b3-  احبطهُ الضَّرْبُ The beating made a mark or
scar, or marks or scars, upon him. (TA.)
-A2-
احبط مَآءُ الرَّكِيَّةِ, (K,) inf. n. إِحْبَاطٌ, (AA, S,) The
water of the well went away, and did not return
(AA, S, K) as it was; (AA, S;) as also ↓ حَبِطَ,
aor.
حَبَطَ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  احبط عَنْ فُلَانٍ He turned away
from, avoided, shunned, and left, such a one.
(IDrd, K.)
Q. Q. 3
اِحْبَنْطَى He (a man, TA) was, or
became, swollen, or inflated, in his belly: (K,
TA:) he (a man) was short and bigbellied: (S:)
he (a man) was, or became, filled with wrath, or
rage; or by repletion of the belly; as also اِحْبَنْطَأَ:
from حَبَطٌ. (TA.) [See 1.]
حَبَطٌ [inf. n. of حَبِطَ, q. v.:] A beast's having
the belly swollen, or inflated, so that what is in
it does not come forth, in consequence of eating
much: (S:) or pain in the belly, of a camel,
from pasture which he finds unwholesome, or
from herbage of which he has eaten much, so
that he becomes swollen, or inflated, therefrom,
(ISd, K,) in his belly, (TA,) and nothing comes
forth from him: (ISd, K:) or a swelling, or
inflation, of the belly, (K,) or a beast's having
the belly swollen, or inflated, (ISk, S,) from
eating [the herb called] ذُرَق: (ISk, S, K:) [see 1:]
and a swelling in the udder or other thing: (K:)
or, accord. to the M, the slightest swelling in the
udder: or, as some say, swelling, or inflation,
wherever it be, from disease or other cause. (TA.)
It is said in a trad., إِنَّ مِمَّا يُنْبِتُ الرَّبِيعُ مضا يَقْتُلُ
حَبَطًا أَوْ يُلِمُّ [Verily, of what the (rain, or season,
called) ربيع causes to grow, is what kills by inflation of the belly, or nearly does so]. (S, TA.) ―
-b2-
The scars, or marks, of a wound, or of whips,
upon the body, after healing: or the swollen scars,
or marks, (of whips, TA,) not lacerated: when
mangled and bleeding, they are termed عُلُوب
[pl. of عَلْب]: (K:) the excrescent flesh upon the
scars of wounds. (Sgh.)
حَبِطٌ part. n. of حَبِطَ; A camel [or other beast
having his belly swollen, or inflated, so that what
is in it does not come forth, in consequence of
eating much: or] having pain in the belly, from
pasture which he finds unwholesome, or from
herbage of which he has eaten much, so that he is
swollen, or inflated, therefrom, [in his belly,] and
nothing comes forth from him: (K:) [see حَبَطٌ:]
pl. حَبَاطَى (K) and حَبَطَةٌ. (M, TA.) You say
also فَرَسٌ حَبِطُ القُصَيْرَى A horse swollen, or inflated, in the flanks. (TA.)
حُبَاطٌ The disease in which the belly is swollen,
or inflated, from eating [the herb called] ذُرَق:
(K:) or, as Az says, accord. to some, it is with
the pointed خ, from التَّخَبُّطُ signifying “ the being
in a state of commotion, agitation, convulsion,
tumult, or disturbance. ” (TA.)
حُبَيْطٍ: see حَبَنْطًى.
حُبَيْطِىٌّ: see حَبَنْطًى.
حَبَنْطًى, with tenween, and حَبَنْطَأٌ, the ن and
the ا [which latter is written in the former word
ى being added to render the word quasi-coordinate to سَفَرْجَلٌ, (S, TA,) the derivation being
from حَبَطٌ, (TA,) A man short and bigbellied;
(S, TA;) as also حَبَنْطَاةٌ and ↓ مُحْبَنْطٍ: (S:) [see
the last of these words below:] or filled with
wrath, or rage; or by repletion of the belly;
(K;) as also حِبَنْطًى and حَبَنْطَاةٌ: (Ks, Lh:) and
this last, a woman short, ugly, and bigbellied;
(K;) also related with ء [i. e. حَبَنْطَأَةٌ, or, as it is
written in the L, حَبَنْطَآءَةٌ, but this I think a mistranscription]. (TA.) When you form the dim.,
you may reject the ن, and change the ا [which is
the final letter] into ى, so that [the dim. becomes
originally حُبَيْطِىٌ, for which, accord. to a wellknown rule,] you say ↓ حُبَيْطٍ, with kesr to the ط,
and with tenween; for the ا is not to denote the
fem. gender, that the letter preceding it should be
with fet-h, as in [حُبَيْلَى and بُشَيْرَى] the dims.
of حُبْلَى and بُشْرَى: you may also retain the ن,
and reject the ا; saying ↓ حُبَيْنِطٌ: and thus you
may do in the case of any noun having two letters
added for the purpose of quasi-coordination: you
may also put a compensation for the letter rejected
in either place, or not: if you put a compensation
in the former instance, you say ↓ حُبَيْطِىٌّ, with
teshdeed to the ى, and with kesr to the ط; and
in the latter instance, you say ↓ حُبَيْنِيطٌ. (S, O,
TA.)
حُبَيْنِطٌ: see حَبَنْطًى.
حُبَينِيطٌ: see حَبَنْطًى.
مُحْبَنْطٍ and مُحْبَنْطِئٌ A man, or child, swollen,
or inflated, in his belly: (TA:) or filled with
anger: (AZ, TA:) or who becomes angry, deeming a thing slow or tardy or late: (IAth, TA:)
or refraining as one who seeks or desires, not as
one who refuses: (TA:) or the former, becoming
angry; and the latter, swollen, or inflated: (IB,
TA:) or the former, deeming a thing slow or
tardy or late; and the latter, bigbellied: and the
latter also signifies cleaving to the ground. (TA.)
See also حَبَنْطًى.
