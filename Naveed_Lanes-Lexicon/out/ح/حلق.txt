حلق1
حَلَقَ رَأْسَهُ, (S, K,) and شَعَرَهُ, (S, M, Msb,)
aor.
حَلِقَ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. حَلْقٌ (S, * M, Msb, K)
and حِلَاقٌ (S, * Msb, K *) and تَحْلَاقٌ, (S, * K,) He
removed the hair of his head [with a razor, or
shaved his head], (K,) [and he shaved off his
hair;] as also ↓ احتلقهُ; (S, K;) and ↓ حلّقهُ,
(K,) inf. n. تَحْلِيقٌ: (TA:) or the latter verb has
an intensive signification, (O, Msb,) and applies
to many objects, (S, Msb,) as in the phrase, حَلَّقُوا
رُؤُوسَهُمْ [they shaved their heads]: (S:) and you
say also, حَلَقَ مَعْزَهُ [he shore his goats]; but not
جَزَّ save in the case of sheep: (S:) [for] الحَلْقُ
with respect to the hair of human beings and of
goats is like الجَزُّ with respect to wool. (M,
TA.) [Hence,] إِنَّ رَأْسَهُ لَجَيِّدُ الحِلَاقِ [Verily
his head is well shaven]. (S, K. *) And يَوْمُ تَحْلَاق
اللَّمَمِ [The day of the shaving off of the locks
termed لمم]; which was a day fought by Teghlib
(S, K) against Bekr Ibn-Wáïl; (S;) because
their [i. e. Teghlib's] distinctive sign was shaving
(الحَلْق), (S, K,) on that day. (S.) ―
-b2-  عَقْرًا حَلْقًا,
or ↓ عَقْرَى حَلْقَى, (S, K, *) is an expression occurring in a trad.: (S:) the latter is rare; or is an
incorrect variation of the relaters of traditions:
(K:) A 'Obeyd says, it is عَقْرًا حَلْقًا, for which
the relaters of traditions say ↓ عَقْرَى حَلْقَى; and
the original form and meaning is عَقَرَهَا اللّٰهُ وَحَلَقَهَا,
(S,) or عَقَرَهَا اللّٰهُ عَقْرًا وَحَلَقَهَا حَلْقًا, (TA,) i. e.,
[accord. to A 'Obeyd,] May God wound her
body, and afflict her with pain in her حَلْق [or
fauces]: (S, K: *) but this explanation is not
valid: accord. to the T, it is a form of imprecation uttered against a woman, [not in earnest,
though denoting a degree of displeasure,] meaning may she be bereft of her husband, or became a
widow, so that she shall shave off her hair: and
Az says that عَقْرَى ↓ حَلْقَى means she is unlucky
[to others] and annoying: ISd says, it is said
to mean she is unlucky [to others]; but I am
not sure of it. (TA.) Accord. to Aboo-Nasr
(S, TA) Ahmad Ibn-Hátim, (S,) one says on the
occasion of an event at which one wonders, خَمْشَى
↓ عَقْرَى حَلْقَى, as though [meaning May she who
has occasioned this, scratch and wound her face,
and shave off her hair:] from الحَلْقُ [the act of
shaving] and العَقْرُ [the act of wounding] and
الخَمْشُ syn. with الخَدْشُ [the act of scratching]:
(S, TA: *) and he cites this verse:
↓ أَلَا قَوْمِى أُولُو عَقْرَى وَحَلْقَى
لِمَا لَا قَتْ سَلَامَانُ بْنُ غَنْمِ
(TA, and so in some copies of the S,) meaning
[Now surely] my people have women who have
wounded and scratched their faces and shaven
off their hair [on account of what the tribe of
Selámán Ibn-Ghanm has experienced]: so, says
IB, IKtt relates this verse, and so Hr in the
Ghareebeyn: but ISk, thus:
أَلَا قَوْمِى إِلَى عَقْرَى وَحَلْقَى
[and so I find it in one copy of the S:] and IJ
explains it by saying that عقرى وحلقى originally
denotes the case of a woman who, when some one
honourable in her estimation has been smitten,
or wounded, takes a pair of sandals, and beats
with them her head, and wounds or scratches it,
and shaves off her hair; and the poet means, my
people have come to the condition of wounded, or
scratched, and shaven, women. (TA.) [Fei says,]
حَلْقًا لَهُ وَعَقْرًا is a form of imprecation, meaning
May God afflict him with pain in his حَلْق [or
fauces], and wound his body: but the relaters of
traditions say عَقْرَى ↓ حَلْقَى, with the fem. alif,
making them act. part. ns.; [the former meaning,
accord. to one of the explanations given above,
an unlucky woman to others, though this is
doubtful; and] the latter meaning a woman
annoying her people: (Msb:) or both these
words are inf. ns., like دَعْوَى. (TA in art. عقر.
[See more in that art]) ―
-b3-  They said also, بَيْنَهُمُ
احْلِقِى وَقُومِى [Among them is heard the saying,
Shave, O woman, and arise]; i. e. among them is
trial, or trouble, and distress, affliction, calamity,
or adversity: and يُوْمُ احْلِقِى وَقُومِى [A day of
the saying Shave, &c.; i. e., of trial, &c.].

and pl. of pauc. أَحْلَاقٌ; (TA;) and أَحْلُقٌ is

-b2-  Also Camels branded with
the mark termed حَلْقَةٌ; (K;) and so ↓ مُحَلَّقَةٌ.

it is a dial. var. of weak authority; (K;)
accord. to Th, allowed by all, though of weak
authority; (S;) or it is used by poetic license;

of a company of men; Lth says that it is the
former in this case, but that some say the latter;
A 'Obeyd prefers the latter in the case of a حلقة
of iron, but allows the former; and prefers the
former in the case of a حلقة of people, but allows
the latter; and Abu-l-'Abbás prefers the former
in both cases, but allows the latter: (L:) the pl.
is ↓ حَلَقٌ, (S, Msb, K,) which is anomalous in
relation to حَلْقَةٌ, (S, Msb,) or [rather] a quasipl. n., (TA,) but regular in relation to حَلَقَةٌ,

of men and of iron, (TA,) like بِدَرٌ (S, K) pl.

regular pl. of حِلْقَةٌ; (TA;) and حَلَقَاتٌ, (AA,
Yoo, S, K,) which is pl. of حَلَقَةٌ; (TA;) and
حِلَقَاتٌ, (K,) which is pl. of حِلْقَةٌ; (TA;) and
حِلَاقٌ in relation to a company of men. (TA.)
You say, اِنْتَزَعْتُ حَلْقَتَهُ [lit. I pulled off his
ring], meaning, (app., Ibn-'Abbád,) (assumed tropical:)  I outwent

the last word being a pl. of حَلْقَةٌ or of حلقَةٌ.
(TA.) And it is said in a trad., نُهِىَ عَنِ الحِلَقِ
قَبْلَ الصَّلَاةِ, i. e. Rings of men [sitting in the
mosque before prayer are forbidden]. (TA.) ―

womb]: one of these is the mouth of the vulva,
at its extremity; [the meatus of the vagina:]
and the other is that which closes upon the مَآء [or
seminal fluid] and opens for the menstrual discharge; [the os uteri:] (K:) or, as some say,
the other is that whence the urine is emitted;
[the meatus urinarius: but the former is the
right explanation: and hence] one says, مَآء
النُّطْفَةُ فِى حَلْقَةِ الرَّحِمِ (tropical:)  The seminal fluid fell
into the entrance of the womb. (TA.) [Hence
also,] حَلْقَةُ الدُّبُرِ (assumed tropical:)  The anus; syn. حِتَارُهُ and
شَرَجُهُ. (Mgh in art. شرج.) [See also خَاتَمٌ, last
