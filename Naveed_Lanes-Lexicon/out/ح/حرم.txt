[Fasting is a state of prohibition], because the
faster is prohibited from doing that which would
break his fast. (Sh, TA.) And الرَّجُلُ يُحْرِمُ فِى

has this meaning; or rather, he was held in reverence, &c.; was reverenced, &c.]

deemed himself in a state of prohibition, after the
death of his son, a hundred years, not laughing]:

of the performance of the حَجّ or the عُمْرَة; (Az,

the present art.]) Hence the saying, فَعَلَهُ فِى حُلِّهِ
وَحُرْمِهِ, and ↓ فِى حِلِّهِ وَ حِرْمِهِ, He did it when he
was free from احرام and when he was in the state
of احرام. (K in art. حل.) And hence the saying
of 'Áïsheh, respecting Mohammad, كُنْتُ أُطَيِّبُهُ
لِحُلِّهِ وَحُرْمِهِ, i. e. [I used to perfume him when he
was free from احرام and] when he was in the
state of احرام: (S, Msb: *) or when he became
free from احرام and when he performed the
ablution and desired to enter upon the state of

[i. e. It is a necessary lot of the people of a town

I'Ab and Fr and Zj: (TA:) some read ↓ حَرْمٌ:
(Bd:) the people of El-Medeeneh read ↓ حَرَامٌ;
meaning forbidden; and accord. to this reading
and meaning, لا is redundant: (TA:) [or حَرَامٌ
in this instance is syn. with وَاجِبٌ, like حِرْمٌ;
for it is said that] the explanation of Ks is confirmed by the saying of 'Abd-er-Rahmán Ibn-Jumáneh [in the TA حمانة, app. for جُمَانَة,] ElMuháribee, a Jáhilee,
لَا أَرَى الدَّهْرَ بَاكِيًا ↓ فَإِنَّ حَرَامًا

(S, IB, TA:) [in the S, this is cited as an ex. of
حَرِمٌ as syn. with حِرْمَانٌ, which is an inf. n. of

specify what these are; but one seems to be حُرْمِيَّةٌ,
for he says that it is from the phrase وَ حُرْمَةِ البَيْتِ
“ by the sacredness of the House ” of God.] Az
says, on the authority of Lth, that when they applied the rel. n. from الحَرَمُ to anything not a
human being, [as, for instance, to a garment, or
piece of cloth,] they said ↓ ثَوْبٌ حَرَمِىٌّ: (Msb:)

a declaration that the wife or the female slave
shall be forbidden [to him who utters it], without
the intention of divorcing [thereby the former, or
of emancipating the latter; so that it may be rendered, according to the two different readings, I
imprecate upon myself, or that which I imprecate

Rabeea, both of them, and the two months of
Jumádà; and they made El-Moharram to be
profane; app. by postponing it, as the pagan
Arabs often did]: the Arabs called it thus because

postponed it]: (TA:) the pl. is مُحَرَّمَاتٌ (Msb,
