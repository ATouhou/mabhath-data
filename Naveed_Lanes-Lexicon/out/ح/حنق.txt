inf. n. تَحْنِيقٌ. (Ibn-' Abbád, K.) IAar says that
you say of seed-produce [or corn] قَنْبَعَ ثُمَّ أَحْنَقَ
ثُمَّ مَدَّ لِلْحَبِّ أَعْنَاقَهُ ثُمَّ حَمَلَ الدَّقِيقَ, i. e. Its
ears had, at the head, what resembled little compact balls: then the extremities of its awn, or
beard, appeared: then the internodal portions of

حَنِيقٌ: see حَنِقٌ: ―

مُحْنَقٌ: see حَنِقٌ.
مُحْنِقٌ Lean, or light of flesh; or slender, and
lean; or lean, and lank in the belly: (AHeyth,
T, TA:) and so the pl. مَحَانِيقُ applied to camels:
(S, K:) or the former, applied to an ass, (S,) or
a camel, (ISd, TA,) lean, &c., as above, (S, ISd,
TA,) in consequence of much covering, (S,) or
from lust, or hunger: and so مَحَانِيقُ applied to
horses; as though they imagined the sing. to
be مِحْنَاقٌ: (ISd, TA:) or the sing., applied to a
horse, (A,) and to an ass, (TA,) lean, &c., as
above, so that the belly cleaves to the back: and
so the pls. مَحَانِقُ and مَحَانِيقُ applied to horses:
(A, TA:) or مَحَانِيقُ signifies fat; as also حُنُقٌ
[pl. of ↓ حَنِيقٌ]; (K, TA;) both applied to camels.
(TA.)
