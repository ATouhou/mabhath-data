-b2-  [Hence,] حَبَسَهُ, (IDrst,
Mgh, Msb, K,) inf. n. حَبْسٌ; (TA;) and ↓ احبسهُ,
(S, IDrst, Mgh, Msb, K, [in one copy of the S,

allowable,]) inf. n. إِحْبَاسٌ; (TA;) and ↓ حبّسهُ,

it, or gave it, (namely, a horse, S, IDrst, A, Mgh,
K,) unalienably, (S, IDrst, Mgh, Msb, K,) to be

A, Mgh, K;) i. e., to the warriors, to ride it in
war against unbelievers and the like: (TA:) it
is said that the chaste forms are ↓ احبسهُ and
↓ حبّسهُ: (TA:) or the latter of these two is sometimes used; (Mgh;) but has an intensive signification [or is applied to several objects]: (Msb:)
حَبَسهُ is said to be a bad form; (TA;) it is used
by the vulgar, but is allowable: ↓ احبسهُ is used
in preference, to signify the bequeathing or giving
of horses and other articles of property that are
forbidden to be [afterwards] sold or given, to
distinguish between that which is so forbidden
and that which is not: (IDrst, TA:) the reverse
is the case with respect to وَقَفَهُ and أَوْقَفَهُ and
وَقَّفَهُ; for the first of these three is the most chaste,
and the last of them is disapproved and rare:
(TA:) شَيْئًا ↓ حبّس, inf. n. تَحْبِيسٌ, signifies (assumed tropical:)  He
made a thing to remain in itself unalienable, (K, *
TA,) not to be inherited nor sold nor given away,

employed in the cause of God, or religion. (K,
TA.) Mohammad is related to have said to
'Omar, respecting some palm-trees belonging to
the latter, (Mgh, TA,) which he (the latter)
desired to give in charity, (TA,) الأَصْلَ ↓ حَبِّسِ
وَسَبِّلِ الثَّمَرَةَ (tropical:)  Make thou the property itself to
remain unalienable, (Mgh, TA,) in perpetuity,
(Mgh,) not to be inherited nor sold nor given
away, (TA,) and assign thou the profit arising
therefrom to be employed in the cause of God, or
religion. (Mgh, TA.) [See حَبِيسٌ.]
