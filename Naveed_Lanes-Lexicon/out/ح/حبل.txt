(S, TA.) So in the saying of El-Mutanakhkhil
El-Hudhalee:
خُطَّ لَهُ ذٰلِكَ فِى المَحْبَلِ  لَا تَقِهِ المَوْتَ وَقِيَّاتُهُ
[His possessions by means of which he preserves
himself shall not preserve him from death: that
was written for him in the time when his mother
was pregnant with him: or the last word is
المَهْبِلِ: so in the TA in arts. هبل and وقى: see
what here follows, in the next sentence]: or
the meaning is that here following. (TA.) ―
-b2-
[The register of God's decrees; which is called]
the first writing: (ISd, K:) but in the verse
cited above, the last word, accord. to some, is
↓ المَحْبِل, (TA,) which means المَهْبِل, (K, TA,)
and this is the reading best known, signifying
the place of gestation in the womb. (TA.)
مَحْبِلٌ: see what next precedes.
مُحَبَّلٌ: see حَبْلٌ, first sentence. ―
-b2-  Also Hair
crisped, or twisted and contracted: so accord. to
the K; in which is added, شِبْهُ الجَثْلِ; but the
right reading is شِبْهُ الحَبْلِ [like the rope or
cord]: or having its locks twisted like ropes or
cords: [thus many Ethiopian races, and some
of the Arab women, twist their hair, like cords;
and thus, generally, did the ancient Egyptians:]
or, accord. to the M, i. q. مَضْفُورٌ [meaning
plaited, or twisted]. (TA.)
مَحْبُولٌ A wild animal caught, or entangled, in
a حَبَالَة [or snare]: (S:) or one for which a
حبالة has been set, though he may not as yet have
fallen into it: and ↓ مُحْتَبَلٌ [in the CK erroneously مُحْتَبِل] one that has fallen into it,
(ISd, K,) and been taken. (ISd, TA.)
مُحْتَبَلٌ: see what next precedes. ―
-b2-  Also [The
place of the hobble; i. e.] (tropical:)  the pastern of a
beast: (T, TA:) or the pasterns of a horse:
(S, K:) originally used in relation to a bird
caught in a snare. (A, TA.)
مُحْتَبِلٌ: see حَابِلٌ.
