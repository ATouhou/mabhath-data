(K,) inf. n. as above, (TA,) He cut the vein, and
then cauterized it to prevent the flow of the blood:
(K:) or this is an elliptical expression, originally
حَسَمَ دَمَ العِرْقِ, meaning he stopped the flow of
blood from the vein by cauterization. (Msb.)
And hence, (Mgh,) اِقْطَعُوهُ ثُمَّ احْسِمُوهُ, (S, Mgh,)
or اِقْطَعُوا يَدَهُ ثُمَّ اكْوُوهَا [Cut ye off his hand,
then cauterize it], (S, * Mgh, * TA,) in order that
the blood may stop. (S, Mgh, TA.) You say
also, حَسَمْتُ الدَّابَّةَ, meaning I cauterized the beast

-b3-  [Hence,
also,] حَسَمَ الدَّآءَ, (K,) inf. n. as above, (TA,)

حَسَمَتْهُ أُمُّهُ الرِّضَاعَ, and الغِذَآءَ, His mother stopped

انحسم It was, or became, cut, or cut off:
(S, Msb, K:) [or it was, or became, cut off entirely: see 1, of which it is the quasi-pass.]
حُسُامٌ A sword; because it cuts that upon which
it comes: (Msb:) or a sharp sword; (S, K, TA;)
and in the same sense applied to a [knife such as
is termed] مُدْيَة: (TA:) and (so in the S, but in
the K “ or ”) the edge of a sword, with which one
strikes. (S, K.) ―
-b2-  لَيْلَةٌ حُسَامٌ A lasting night:
(K:) or a night of lasting evil, especially. (TA.)
حُسُومٌ Unluckiness, or inauspiciousness. (S, *
K, * TA.) Some explain it thus in the passage
here following. (S, * TA.) ―
-b2-  سَخَّرَهَا عَلَيْهِمْ سَبْعَ
لَيَالِ وَ ثَمَانِيَةَ أَيَّامٍ حُسُومًا, in the Kur lxix. 7, means
He sent it (the wind) upon them by force, (Jel,)
or made it to prevail against them by his power,
(Bd,) [seven nights and eight days] consecutively;
(T, S, Bd, K, Jel;) an expression taken from the
repetition of the act of cauterization, (T, Bd, Jel.)
i. e. the act of the ↓ حَاسِم; (Jel;) whence this
word (حاسم) is applied to anything made consecutive; (T, TA;) and حُسُومٌ is its pl.: (T, Bd,
TA:) or حُسُومٌ signifies the making consecutive.
and, as an epithet, consecutive, and continuous
from first to last: (Fr, TA:) or, accord. to some,
الأَيَّامُ الحُسُومٌ means the days that are consecutive
with evil especially; and such ISd thinks to be
the meaning: (TA:) or اللَّيَالِى الحُسُومُ means
the nights that cut off good, or prosperity, (↓ تَحّسِمُ
الخَيْرَ,) from their people: (S, * K: [and the like
is said by Bd in lxix. 7:]) or حُسُومًا in the Kur
means causing them to pass away, come to an
end, cease, perish, or come to nought: (Zj, T:)
or it may be an inf. n., meaning for the purpose
of cutting off: or an inf. n. of a verb meant to be
understood, as a denotative of state; i. e. ↓ تَحْسِمُهُمْ
حُسُومًا [agreeably with the explanation of Zj];
and this is confirmed by the reading with fet-h
[i. e. حَسُومًا, though this is a very rare form of
inf. n.]: (Bd:) you say أَيَّامٌ حُسُومٌ, (K,) in which
case the latter word is an inf. n. used as an epithet,
meaning cutting off, or preventing, good, or prosperity; (TA;) and أَيَّامُ حُسُومٍ, which has a similar
meaning. (K, TA.)
حَاسِمٌ; pl. حُسُومٌ: see this latter word.
مَحْسَمَةٌ A cause, or means, of cutting off, or
stopping; (T, K, TA;) syn. مَقْطَعَةٌ. (T, TA.)
So in the saying, هٰذَا مَحْسَمَةٌ لِلدَّآءِ This is a cause,
or means, of cutting off, or stopping, the disease.
(K, * TA.) And hence, (TA,) عَلَيْكُمْ بِالصَّوْمِ فَإِنَّهُ
مَحْسَمَةٌ لِلْعِرْقِ وَ مَذْهَبَةٌ لِلْأَشَرِ, a trad., (T, S, TA,)
meaning [Keep ye to fasting, for it is] a cause,
or means, of stopping venereal intercourse, [and a
cause, or means, of dispelling exultation, or excessive exultation, and resting the mind upon
things agreeable with natural desire:] (TA:) or
an impediment to venery, and a cause of diminishing the seminal fluid, and of stopping venereal
intercourse or passion, &c. (T, TA.)
مَحْسُومٌ A child (TA) whose sucking is stopped:
(K, TA:) and whose food is stopped. (TA.) And
A child badly fed. (S, K.) Hence the prov.,
وَلْغُ جُرَىٍّ كَانَ مَحْسُومًا [The lapping of a little
puppy that had been badly fed]: said on the
occasion of a greedy person's taking much of a
thing that he had not been able to obtain, and
that he had became able to obtain; or in ordering
one to take much when able. (TA. [See Freytag's
Arab. Prov. ii. 817; where another reading is
given, namely, مَحْشُومًا in the place of مَحْسُومًا,
as well as the reading here given.])
