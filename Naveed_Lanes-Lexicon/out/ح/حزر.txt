خَرَصَهُ, (S, K,) and قَدَّرَهُ بِالحَدْسِ; (M;) he took
its quantity or measure &c. by the eye. (TK.)
[He conjectured it; and so ↓ حزّرهُ, inf. n. تَحْزِيرٌ:
perhaps post-classical: whence عِلْمُ التَّحْزِيرِ The
science of divination.] You say, حَزَرَ النَّخْلِ He
computed by conjecture the quantity of the fruit
upon the palm-trees. (A, Msb.) And حَزَرْتُ قِرَاءَتَهُ
عِشْرِينَ آيَةً (tropical:)  I computed his recitation, or reading,
to be twenty verses [of the Kur-án]. (A.) And
حَزَرْتُ فُدُومَهُ يَوْمَ كَذَا (tropical:)  I computed his arrival
to be on such a day. (A.) And اِحْزِرْ نَفْسِكَ هَلْ
تَقْدِرُ عَلَيْهِ (tropical:)  Measure thyself, whether thou be able
to do it. (A.)

حَزْرَةُ المَالِ The better, or best, of cattle or other
property; (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K;) as also ↓ حَزِيرَةُ
المالِ: or the latter signifies property to which
the heart clings: (TA:) the term حزرة is applied
alike to what is masc. and what is fem.: (AO,
Msb:) the pl. is حَزَرَاتٌ (S, Msb, K) and حَزْرَاتٌ,
as though the sing. were an epithet: (Msb:) it
is applied to the better or best of property because
the owner of such property always, when he sees
it, computes its quantity or number in his mind:
accord. to Aboo-Sa'eed, حَزَرَاتُ الأَمْوَالِ signifies
those kinds of property which their owners love:
accord. to AO, choice kinds of property. (TA.)
You say also, هٰذَا حَزْرَةُ نَفْسِى, meaning This is
the best of what I have: and of such property
the collector of the poor-rate is forbidden to take.

choice thing of his heart. (AO.)

(TA:) or, accord. to As and El-Mufaddal, a
young boy, who has not attained the age of
puberty: and sometimes, one who has attained
that age, and become strong in body, and has

(Az:) and a strong man: and, contr., a weak

man, it signifies strong: and when applied to an
old man, weak: (Abu-t-Teiyib:) pl. حَزَاوِرَةٌ (S,
