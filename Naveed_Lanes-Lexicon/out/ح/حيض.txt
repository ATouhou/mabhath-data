حيض1
حَاضَتْ, (S, A, Msb, K,) aor. تَحِيضُ, inf. n.
حَيْضٌ and مَحِيضٌ (S, Msb, K) and مَحَاضٌ,
(Aboo-Is-hák, K,) said of a woman, (S, A, Msb,
K,) She menstruated; i. e. her blood flowed;
(A;) or [rather] blood came forth from her
womb; (Mgh;) [not in consequence of disease
nor of childbirth, nor before she had attained to
puberty; as explained in the law-books of the
Muslims;] as also ↓ تحيّضت: or this latter signifies she likened herself to the حَائِض. (TA.) ―
-b2-
Also She attained the age of menstruation. (TA.)
[See حَائِضٌ.] ―
-b3-  حَاضَتِ السَّمُرَةُ, (S, A, Msb,) aor.
as above, (Msb,) inf. n. حَيْضٌ, (S, Msb,) (tropical:)  The
سمرة [or gum-acacia-tree] flowed with, (S,) or
emitted, (A,) a matter resembling blood; (S, A;)
flowed with its gum: (Msb:) the matter which
it emits is called دُوَدِم; and is applied to the head
of a new-born infant to scare away the jánn, or
genii. (A, TA: [but in a copy of the A, and in
one instance in the TA, الشَّجَرَةُ is put in the place
of السَّمُرَةُ, app. by mistake.]) [I have marked this
signification as tropical on the authority of the A
and TA; but the author of the Msb has commenced the art. with it; and shows that he held
the opinion, which some others have shared with
him, that it is the primary signification.] ―
-b4-
حَاضَ السَّيْلُ (assumed tropical:)  The torrent overflowed; or poured
out, or forth, from fulness; or ran; syn. فَاضَ.
(TA.)

حيّض المَرْأَةَ He attributed حَيْض [or menstruation] to the woman. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  حيّض جَارِيَتَهُ,
(TK,) inf. n. تَحْيِيضٌ, (Sgh, K,) Tempore men-
struorum inivit ancillam suam. (Sgh, K, TK.)

تحيّضت: see 1. ―
-b2-  Also She abstained form
prayer (الصلاة) during the days of her حَيْض [or
menstruation]; (S, Msb, K, TA;) waiting for
the stopping of the blood: (TA:) or she abstained,
and did as the حَائِض does: (A, * Mgh:) or she
reckoned herself حائض, and did as the حائض
does. (TA.)

اُسْتُحِيضَتْ, (S, Mgh, Msb,) in the pass.
form, (Msb,) with damm to the ت, (Mgh,) [as
though originally signifying She was reckoned to
be menstruating,] found in the handwriting of
Aboo-Zekereeyà اِسْتَحْيَضَتْ, (TA,) [which I hold
to be a mistake, as being at variance with general
usage,] She continued to have a flow of blood (S,
Mgh) after her days [of menstruation]: (S:) or
she had an exuberance of blood [flowing from the
vagina]; not what is termed الحَيْض: (Msb:) or
her blood flowed without stopping, not on certain
days, nor from the vein [or veins] of menstruation,
but from a vein called العَاذِلُ. (TA.)
حَيْضٌ [an inf. n. of 1: explained in the KT as
applied to The menstrual blood itself; which seems
to have been more properly called حِيضَةٌ and
مَحِيضٌ and حِيَاضٌ: though what here follows
may be considered as rendering it probable that
حَيْضٌ was also used in this sense in the classical
times, for دَمُ حَيْضٍ]. ―
-b2-  حَيْضُ السَّمُرِ (assumed tropical:)  A thing
which flows from the سَمُر [or gum-acacia-trees],
resembling [what is called] دَمُ الغَزَالِ. (Mgh.)
[See also 1.]
حَيْضَةٌ A single time, or turn, of menstruation,
or of the flow of the menstrual blood: (S, * A, *
Mgh, Msb: *) pl. حِيَضٌ; (A, Msb;) like as بِدَرٌ
is pl. of بَدْرَةٌ, and ضِيَعٌ of ضَيْعَةٌ, and حِيَدٌ of حَيْدَةٌ,
and خِيَمٌ of خَيْمَةٌ; though by rule it should be
حَيْضَاتٌ. (Msb.) You say, حَاضَتْ حَيْضَةً وَاحِدَةً
[She menstruated one single time of menstruation]:
and حَيْضَةً طَوِيلَةً [a long single time thereof]:
and ثَلَاثَ حِيَضٍ [three single times thereof]. (A.)
―
-b2-  As used by the professors of practical law,
The accustomed days thereof. (Mgh.) ―
-b3-  Also
(assumed tropical:)  A single flow [of water &c.]: pl. حَيْضَاتٌ.
(TA.)
حِيضَةٌ [Menstruation;] the subst. from حَاضَتِ
المَرْأَةُ: (S, K, TA:) or a mode, or manner, or
state, of حَيْض [or menstruating]: (Msb:) or
the state (Mgh, TA) of the حَائِض, (TA,) which
is one of avoidance (Mgh, TA) of prayer and
fasting and the like: (Mgh:) pl. حِيَضٌ. (S,
Msb.) ―
-b2-  Also The menstrual blood; the blood
of menstruation; and so ↓ مَحِيضٌ and ↓ حِيَاضٌ.
(TA.) [See also حَيْضٌ.] ―
-b3-  Also The piece of
rag which the حَائِض binds over her vulva; (S,
Mgh, * Msb, * K;) and so ↓ مَحِيضةٌ: (S:) which
latter also signifies (assumed tropical:)  a piece of rag thrown away:
(TA:) pl. of the latter, مَحَايِضُ. (S, TA.)
[
حَيْضِىٌّ Menstrual; of, or relating to, menstruation.]
حِيَاضٌ: see حِيضَةٌ.
حَائِضٌ, applied to a woman, [Menstruating;]
act. part. n. from حَاضَتْ; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;)
thus, [without ة,] because it is an epithet of particular application [to a female]; (Msb;) and
with ء, being like قَائِمٌ and صَائِمٌ &c.; (TA;)
[because the ى in its verb suffers alteration;]
and in like manner حَائِضَةٌ also, (S, Mgh, Msb,
K,) on the authority of Fr: (S:) pl. (of the
former, Msb) حُيَّضٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) like as
رُكَّعٌ is pl. of رَاكِعٌ, (Msb,) and حَاضَةٌ, like as
حَاكَةٌ is pl. of حَائِكٌ, (TA,) and of the latter,
حَائِضَاتٌ, (Msb,) or حَوَائِضُ. (S, Mgh, K.) ―
-b2-  In
a certain trad., in which it is said that God will
not accept the prayer of a حَائِض unless she be
[attired] with a خِمَار [or head-covering], this does
not mean one who is menstruating while actually
occupied by prayer, (Msb, TA, *) but (assumed tropical:)  One who
has attained to the age of menstruation; (TA;)
or one who has attained to womanhood: (Mgh:)
or it has not this meaning; for if it had, one would
understand that a girl not arrived at puberty
might pray with her head uncovered, which is not
the case; but it means (tropical:)  [one of] the menstruating
kind, whether she have attained to puberty or
not; as though the term female had been used in
its place. (Msb.)
مَحِيضٌ is a simple subst. as well as an inf. n.:
(Zj, K:) as the former, it is a n. of place; and as
such it is [said to be] used in the Kur ii. 222; meaning A woman's مَأْتًى; (Zj;) her فَرْج; (Mgh;) because it is the place of الحَيْض. (Zj, Mgh.) Some
say that حَوْضٌ is hence derived; because the
water flows to the حوض: (Az, K:) for the Arabs
put و in the place of ى, and ى in that of و.
(Az, TA.) ―
-b2-  It is also a n. of time [signifying
The time of menstruating]. (TA.) ―
-b3-  See also
حِيضَةٌ. ―
-b4-  When it is a simple subst., it has a pl.,
namely مَحَايِضُ. (TA.)
مَحِيضَةٌ: see حِيضَةٌ.
مُسْتَحَاضَةٌ A woman continuing to have a flow
of blood after her days [of menstruation]: (S:)
or having an exuberance of blood [flowing from
her vagina]; not what is termed الحَيْض: (Msb:)
or having her blood flowing without stopping, not
on certain days, nor from the vein [or veins]
of menstruation, but from a vein called العَاذِلُ.
(K, * TA.)
