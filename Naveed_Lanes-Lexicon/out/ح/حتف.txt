حتف1
حَتَفَ, aor.
حَتِفَ, is a verb mentioned by IKoot
and IKtt and others, as derived from حَتْفٌ signifying “ death,” though J says that no verb
is formed from this word; as IF and Meyd and
Az also assert: (MF, TA:) and حُتُوفٌ is its
inf. n., as well as pl. of حَتْفٌ: [accord. to SM,
it is intrans., signifying He died; for he says,]
hence the saying in the A, المَرْءُ يَسْعَى وَيَطُوفُ
وَعَاقِبَتُهُ الحُتُوفُ [Man labours, and goes about:
and his end is dying]. (TA.) [But see what
follows.]
-A2-  IF says that no verb is formed from
حَتْفٌ signifying “ death; ” and so, after him, J;
and Az says that he had heard no such verb:
but IKoot mentions حَتَفَهُ, aor.
حَتِفَ, inf. n. حَتْفٌ, as
signifying He, or it, killed him; or caused him
to die. (Msb.)
حَتْفٌ Death: (S, Msb, K, &c.:) pl. حُتُوفٌ.
(S, K.) You say, مَاتَ حَتْفَ أَنْفِهِ, (A 'Obeyd, S,
Mgh, Msb, K,) and حَتْفَ فِيهِ, but this is rare,
and حَتْفَ أَنْفَيْهِ, (K,) which may mean مَنْخِرَيْهِ,
or it may mean أَنْفه وَفَمه, the انف being made
predominant, (TA,) He died upon his bed;
(A 'Obeyd, Mgh, Msb, K;) [a natural death;]
respiring until he yielded his last breath; (Msb;)
not from slaughter, nor beating, (A 'Obeyd, S,
Msb, K,) nor drowning, nor burning, (A 'Obeyd,
Sgh, Msb, K,) nor by a wild beast, &c.: (A 'Obeyd,
TA:) the nose is particularized as meaning that
the spirit passes forth from it with the breath;
or because they imagined that the spirit of the
sick man passes forth from his nose, and that of
the wounded man from his wound; (IAth, K;)
or because the spirit passes forth from the mouth
and the nose, and the latter of these is made
predominant: (O, TA:) and حتف is put in the
accus. case in the manner of an inf. n. (TA.)
This phrase was used in the time of paganism,
by Es-Semow-al: (Msb, TA:) or, accord. to
some, in the phrase attributed to him, the right
reading is not مات حتف انفه, but مات فِى فِرَاشِهِ;
and the former was first used by Mohammad.
(Ham p. 52.) It is said of a human being: (S,
Mgh:) and then of any animal when it dies
without any accidental cause: (Mgh:) hence, of
a fish that has died, and floats upon the water.
(Msb, TA.) It is said in a trad. of 'Ámir Ibn-Fuheyreh,
وَالمَرْءُ يَأْتِى حَتْفُهُ مِنْ فَوْقِهِ
[And man, his death comes from above him]:
meaning that his caution and his cowardice will not
repel from him the decree of death when it befalls
him: originally said by 'Amr Ibn-Mámeh. (L,
TA.)
-A2-  حَيَّةٌ حَتْفَةٌ [A dead serpent] is a phrase
like اِمْرَأَةٌ عَدْلَةٌ: (Z, TA:) the latter word is
here an epithet. (Z, K.)
