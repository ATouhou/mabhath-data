all verbs coordinate to استحوذ, the original letters
of the root may be preserved: that the Arabs say
اِسْتَصَابَ and اِسْتَصْوَبَ, and اِسْتَجَابَ and اِسْتَجْوَبَ:
and that their doing so is agreeable with a rule
constantly obtaining with them. (S.) The grammarians say that he who says حَاذَ, aor. يَحُوذُ,
