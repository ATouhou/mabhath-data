حش1
حَشَّ, (Msb, K,) aor.
حَشُ3َ, [contr. to general
rule in the case of an intrans. v. of this class,
unless the sec. pers. of the pret. be حَشُشْتَ, which
seems to be not improbable,] inf. n. حَشٌّ, (Msb,)
It (a plant, or herbage, Msb, or a shoot of a
palm-tree cut off from the mother-tree, or plucked
forth from the ground, and planted, K) dried, or
dried up. (Msb, K.) [Accord. to my copy of the
Msb, the same is said of a well; but I incline to
think that بِئْر is here written by mistake for تِبْن
(meaning straw) or some similar word.] You say
also, حَشَّ الوَلَد, (IAar, S, A, K,) aor. and inf. n.
as above, (TA,) or inf. n. حُشُوشٌ, (IAar,) and,
as some say, حُشَّ; (A'Obeyd, S;) and ↓ استحشّ;
(TA;) The child, or young one, (S, A, K,) of a
she-camel, (IAar,) dried up in the belly, (S, A,
K,) or womb, (TA,) the time of the birth having
been exceeded. (TA.) And حَشَّتِ اليَدُ, (A, K,)
and حُشَّت, (Yoo,) and ↓ احشّث, (S, K,) and
↓ استحشّت, (Yoo, K,) The arm, or hand, dried
up; (S, A;) and became unsound in its veins or
ducts, and so rendered motionless; syn. شُلَّت:
(S, K:) or, as some say, became slender and
small. (TA.)
-A2-  حَشَّهُ, (S, Msb, K,) aor.
حَشُ3َ, [in
this case agreeable with general rule,] inf. n. حَشٌّ,
(Msb, TA,) He cut it, namely, حَشِيش [or dry
herbage]: (S, Mgh, Msb, K:) and he collected
it; as also ↓ احتشّهُ: (TA:) or the former has the
former signification [only]; and ↓ the latter signifies he sought it, and collected it. (S, K, TA.)
You say also, حَشَّ لِبَعِيرِهِ He collected dry herbage
(حَشِيش) for his camel. (TA in art. بقل.) And
حَشَّ عَلَى دَابَّتِهِ He cut dry herbage (حشيش) for
his beast. (TA.) And حَشَّ عَلَى غَنَمِهِ He beat
the branches of the trees so that its leaves became
scattered [for, or upon, his sheep or goats]; like
هَشَّ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also, (S, K,) aor. as above, (S,
A, K,) and so the inf. n., (TA,) He threw to him
(namely a horse) حَشِيش [or dry herbage]; (S,
K;) he fed him therewith. (A, TA.) Az says, I
have heard the Arabs say to a man حُشَّ فَرَسَكَ
[Feed thou thy horse with dry herbage]. (TA.)
Hence the prov., أَحُشُّكَ وَ تَرُوثُنِى [I feed thee with
dry herbage and thou dungest upon me]: (S, A,
K:) and if it were said with س [أَحُسُّكَ, “I
carry thee,”] it would not be strange: (S:) applied to him who does evil to one who does good
to him: (Az, K:) or to any one to whom a
benefit has been done and who requites it with
the contrary thereof, or is not grateful for it nor
profits by it: and thus the prov. is related in the T
and S and M and A [and K]; but by 'Abd-es-Selám
El-Basree, أَحُشَّكِ وَ تَرُوثِينَنِى. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Hence,
(A,) حَشَّ النَّارَ, (S, A, K,) aor. and inf. n. as
above, (S,) and Az adds بِالْحَطَبِ, (TA,) (tropical:)  He
kindled the fire; or made it to burn, or to burn
fiercely; (S, A, K;) and fed it with firewood,
like as one feeds a beast with حَشِيش: (A, TA:)
or he collected to it what was scattered of the firewood: (TA:) and he stirred it. (K.) ―

K, *) by [adding to it] the property of another:
(A:) or حَشَّ بِهِ مَالًا he put property into, or

him with property. (El-Báhilee.) ―
-b7-  And حَشَّ
سَهْمَهُ, (S, A, O,) aor. and inf. n. as above, (TA,)
(tropical:)  He feathered his arrow: (A, O:) or stuck the
feathers upon the sides of his arrow: (S:) or
mounted them upon his arrow. (TA.)
4
احشّ It (herbage) became in such a state
that it might be cut (ISh, K) and gathered,
(TA,) being dried up. (ISh.) ―
-b2-  أَحَشَّتِ اليَدُ:
see حَشَّت. ―
-b3-  Also احشّت She (a woman, S and
K, and a camel, TA) had her child, or young one,
dried up in her belly. (S, K.)
-A2-  أَحَشَّ اللّٰهُ يَدَهُ
[May God make his arm, or hand, to dry up;
or to become unsound in its veins or ducts, and so
rendered motionless;] is a form of imprecation
used by the Arabs. (TA.) ―
-b2-  احشّ فُلَانًا He cut
(K) and collected (TA) حَشِيش [or dry herbage]
with such a one; (K;) as though he helped him
in doing so. (TA.)

حَشَّ; and حَشَّت.
حَشٌّ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and ↓ حُشٌّ, (S, Msb,
K,) but the former is the more common, (Msb,)
and ↓ حِشٌّ, (K,) A garden: (El-Fárábee, S, Mgh,
Msb, K: *) or a garden of palm-trees: (AHát,
Msb:) pl. حِشَّانٌ (S, Msb) and حُشَّانٌ. (Msb.)
―
-b2-  Hence, (tropical:)  A privy; (El- Fárábee, S, A, Mgh,
Msb, K;) likewise called بَيْتُ الحَشِّ or ↓ الحُشِّ:
(Msb:) because they used to ease themselves in
the gardens: (S, Mgh, Msb, K:) then, when
they made privies, they applied thus this appellation: (Msb:) and in like manner, ↓ مَحَشٌّ; but
accord. to the Abridgment of the 'Eyn., this is
proper, not tropical: (Msb:) or this last, also
written ↓ مِحَشٌّ, signifies the same; (TA;) or a
place in which human ordure has become collected: (K:) the pl. of حشّ as applied to a privy
is حُشُوشٌ (S, Mgh, K) and حُشُّونَ. (Ibn-'Abbád,
K.)
-A2-  See also مَحَشَّةٌ.

her womb]. (L from a verse of Ibn-Mukbil.)
حَشِيشٌ Dry herbage; (Msb;) dry pasture, or
fodder: (El-Fárábee, S, Mgh, Msb, K:) of the
measure فَعِيلٌ in the sense of the measure فَاعِلٌ:
(Msb:) what is fresh is not so called: (S, Msb:)
but عُشْبٌ is applied to what is fresh and what is
dry: this, says ISd, is the opinion of the generality of the lexicologists: some [he adds] assert
that حشيش is green pasture or herbage, as well
as dry: but he says that this is not correct; [and
the like is said in the Msb;] for this word is properly applied to denote dryness and contraction:
ISh says that it is applied to all herbs, or leguminous plants, fresh as well as dry; as also عَلَفٌ
and خَلًى: Az says that when they use it unrestricted, the Arabs mean thereby حَلِىّ, [which is
the herb called نَصِىّ when it has become dry and
white,] in particular; and that this is the best
kind of fodder; that horses thrive upon it, and it
is one of the best pastures for camels, or for
camels and sheep and goats; a good supply in
years of scarcity: (TA:) or it signifies cut herbage or pasture; and is of the measure فَعِيلٌ in the
sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ: (Msb:) the n. un.
is with ة, signifying a fascicle, or wisp, of حَشيش:
(TA:) [and sometimes a herb of any kind: the pl.
is حَشَائِشُ.] ―
-b2-  [It is also applied, in the present
day, to Hemp, used for its intoxicating property;
both fresh and dry: app. what is termed حَشِيشُ
الحَرَافِيشِ in the K, voce بَنْجٌ, q. v.: and also
termed حَشِيشَةٌ الفَقَرَآءِ: see De Sacy's “ Chrest.
Arabe,”, see. ed., vol. i. pp. 210-283. ―
-b3-  حَشِيشَةُ
السُّلْطَانِ: see خَرْدَلٌ.] ―
-b4-  حَشِيشٌ also signifies A
child, or young one, that has dried up in the belly
of its mother; (Mgh, Msb, TA;) and so ↓ حَشٌّ
and ↓ مَحْشُوشٌ and ↓ أُحْشُوشٌ: (TA:) or حُشٌّ
[and the rest], a child, or young one, that perishes
in the belly of its mother. (K.) It is said in a
trad., فَأَلْقَتْ حشِيشًا And she cast forth a child, or
young one, dried up. (Mgh.) And you say,
أَلْقَتْ وَلَدَهَا حَشِيشًا She (a camel) cast forth her
young one dried up. (Msb.)
حُشَاشَةٌ The [last] remains of the spirit (S, A, *
Msb, K) in the heart, (TA,) [or of life;] in a
sick man, (S, Msb, K,) and in one who is wounded;
(K;) as also ↓ حُشَاشٌ, (S, Msb, K,) the ة being
sometimes elided. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  And (assumed tropical:)  Any remains,
or relic. (TA.) You say, مَا بَقِىَ مِنَ المُرُوْءَةِ إِلَّا
حُشَاشَةٌ تَتَرَدَّدُ فِى أَحْشَآءِ مُحْتَضَرٍ (tropical:)  [There remained
not, of manliness, save a last relic going to and
fro, or wavering, in the entrails of one at the
point of death]. (A, TA.) And مَا بَقِىَ مِنَ الشَّمْسِ
إِلَّا حُشَاشَةٌ نَازِعٌ (tropical:)  [There remained not, of the sun,
save a last departing relic]. (A, TA.)
[
حَشَائِشِىٌّ One skilled in the knowledge of herbs:
so in modern works. ―
-b2-  Accord. to Golius, as on
the authority of the KL, but not in my copy of
that work, A collector of hay; a forager.]

مَحَشٌّ, (S, A, TA,) or ↓ مِحَشٌّ, (K, [but this

omission of وَالمَحَشُّ, as is indicated by the addition of وَيُكْسَرُ shortly after, referring to the word
in a sense different from that which is here next
mentioned,] A place, (S,) or land, (K,) in which
is much حَشِيش [or dry herbage]; (S, K) as also
↓ مَحَشَّةٌ: (K:) or a place in which one cuts
حشيش: (A:) and the first (مَحَشٌّ) a place in
which are much pasture, or herbage, and wealth,
or good things. (K.) You say, هٰذَا مَحَشُّ صِدْقٍ,
meaning This is a [good] region abounding in
حَشِيش. (TA.) And إِنَّكَ بِمَحَشِّ صِدْقٍ فَلَا تَبْرَحْهُ
Verily thou art in a place abounding in good
things, therefore do not quit it: so in some copies
of the S; and accord. to this explanation, the
word is tropically used: in other copies of the S,
in a place abounding in حَشِيش. (TA.) ―
-b2-  See
also حَشٌّ. ―
-b3-  Also the former, A thing in which

the more chaste; (A 'Obeyd, S, K;) and ↓ مِحَشَّةٌ,

some copies of the K; (TA:) and ↓ حُشَاشٌ, like

first two of these words are applied to a woollen
كِسَآء [q. v.] in which حَشِيش is put: (IAth:)

serrated] مِنْجَل [or reaping-hook] with which
حَشِيش is cut; as also ↓ مَحَشٌّ; but the former is

latter is the better. (TA.)

(S, A.) And مِحَشُّ حَرْبٍ signifies (tropical:)  A kindler
