Q. 3
احْلَنْقَمَ He left, or forsook, food; expl.
by تَرَكَ الطَّعَامَ. (K.)
حُلْقُومٌ The windpipe, or passage of the breath;
(T, Mgh, TA;) by the cutting, or severing, of
which, and of the مَرِىْء [or œsophagus] and
وَدَجَانِ [or two external jugular veins], the lawful
slaughtering of an animal is completed: (T, TA:)
accord. to the S and K, [and to the Msb, in art.
حلق, though it is there correctly and fully explained as meaning the windpipe,] i. q. حَلْقٌ: but
in the M it is explained [agreeably with general usage] as the passage of the breath, and
of coughing, from the جَوْف [or chest]; consisting
of a series of successively-superimposed cartilages
(أَطْبَاقُ غَرَاضِيفَ), before which, in the exterior of
the throat, is nothing but skin; having its lower
extremity in the lungs, and its upper extremity
at the root of the tongue: from it pass forth the
breath and the wind and the saliva and the voice:
[see also another explanation voce حَلْقٌ, from Zj
in his “ Khalk el-Insán,” and the Msb:] pl.
حَلَاقِمُ and حَلَاقِيمُ. (TA.) Accord. to some, the
م is augmentative: accord. to others, radical.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] they say, نَزَلْنَا مِثْلَ حُلْقُومِ
النَّعَامَةِ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  We alighted in a strait, or
confined, place. (TA.) And حَلَاقِيمُ البِلَادِ means
(assumed tropical:)  The strait, or confined, parts of the country, or
of countries: (Mgh:) or the lateral, and extreme,
parts thereof. (TA.)
حُلْقَامةٌ: see what follows.
رُطَبٌ مُحَلْقِمٌ [or rather بُسْرٌ محلقم] (assumed tropical:)  Dates
that have begun to be ripe next the base; (K;)
[or that have become ripe to the extent of two
thirds; (see حُلْقَانٌ in art. حلق;)] as also مُحَلْقِنٌ:
(TA:) and ↓ رُطَبَةٌ حُلْقَامَةٌ [or rather بُسْرَةٌ حلقامة
(in the CK حَلْقَامَةٌ)] is applied to a single date
in this sense. (K, * TA.)
