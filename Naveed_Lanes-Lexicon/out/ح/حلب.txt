(S, Mgh, Msb, TA) &c., (Msb,) a ewe, a she-goat, and a cow: (TA:) he drew forth the milk

milked with the strongest fore arm] is a prov.,
meaning thou hast asked aid of him who will perform thine affair, or thy want: (TA:) or, accord.
to A'Obeyd, حَلَبْتُهَا الخ I have milked her &c.,

sitting; i. e., lose thy camels, and become an
owner only of sheep or goats, and thus, after
having milked camels standing, milk sheep or
goats sitting: this, also, is a proverbial saying,

not hot milk. (TA.) And حَلَبَ الدَّهْرَ أَشْطُرَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He

فَاشْرُبْ (tropical:)  [Not at every time is it said, kneel thou,
and understand] is a prov. applied in the case of

that الحلب signifies the act of kneeling; and
الشرب the understanding a thing: and one says to
a stupid person, اُحْلُبْ ثُمَّ اشْرُبْ Kneel thou;
then understand: one says also, ليس كلُ حين

حَلُوبٌ and ↓ حَلُوبَةٌ (of which the latter is the

(S, TA:) it increases the milk, and fattens; and
gazelles are snared [while pasturing] upon it

that feeds upon the حلّب]: (S:) it is a curling
herb, of a dusty colour inclining to green, that
spreads upon the ground; when a piece of it is
cut off, a milky fluid flows from it: (As, S:)
AHn says, it is a plant that spreads upon the

intensely green, growing most when the heat
becomes great: and he adds, on the authority of

(TA:) you should not say الحَلَمَهْ. (S.) IKtt
gives it differently, thus: حَتَّى تَؤُوبَ الحَلَبَهْ
[Until the milkers return]: but the former reading
is that commonly known. (IB, TA.) لَيْسَ لَهَا
رَاعٍ وَلٰكِنَّ حَلَبَةٌ [They (i. e. camels) have not a
pastor, but milkers] is another prov., applied to
a man who asks thine aid, and whom thou aidest,

it is incorporated being termed ↓ مَحْلَبِيَّةٌ: so say
IDrst and others: AHn says that he had not
heard of its growing anywhere in the country
of the Arabs: accord. to Aboo-Bekr Ibn-Talhah,
a tree having a grain (حَبّ) like that of the
رَيْحَان [which is likewise used in medicine, called
بِزْرُ الرَّيْحَانِ, i. e. the seed of the ocimum basilicum,
or common sweet basil]: accord. to Aboo-'Obeyd
El-Bekree, the [tree called] أَرَاك: (TA:) [J says,]
حَبُّ المَحْلَبِ is an aromatic medicine, the place
whereof is المَحْلَبِيَّةُ, (S,) which is a town (بَلَدٌ)
near El-Mósil: (K, TA:) IKh calls it a kind of
perfume: some say it is the grain of the خِرْوَع
[or castor-oil-plant]: others, that the محلب is
the fruit, or produce, of the kind of tree termed
شَجَرُ اليُسْرِ, which the Arabs call الأُسْر: IDrd
says that it is the grain with which one perfumes;
calling the grain by the name of محلب: (TA:)
the best is the white, pearly, and clear. (Ibn-Seenà, book ii. p. 210.) Accord. to IDrst, this
word is originally an inf. n., and حبّ المحلب
and شجرة المحلب mean حبّ الحلب and شجرة
الحلب. (TA. [IbrD informs me that it is a
custom of some of the Arabs, previously to their
milking, to chew some محلب, and to anoint
with it the teat of the animal.])
