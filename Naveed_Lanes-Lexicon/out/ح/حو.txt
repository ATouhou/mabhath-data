حو1
حَوِىَ [originally حَوِوَ]: see what next follows.
9
اِحْوَوَى, (As, S, K,) [like اِرْعَوَى, originally
اِحْوَوَّ, of the measure اِفْعَلَّ, then اِحْوَوَوَ, and then
اِحْوَوَى,] aor. يَحْوَوِى, inf. n. اِحْوِوَآءٌ, said of a
horse, (As, S,) He was, or became, of the colour
termed حُوَّةٌ [q. v. infrà]; as also ↓ اِحْوَاوَى, (As,
S, K,) [originally اِحْوَاوَّ, of the measure اِفْعَالَّ,
then اِحْوَاوَوَ, and then اِحْوَاوَى,] aor. يَحْوَاوِى,
inf. n. اِحْوِيوَآءٌ, (As, S,) or, accord. to ISd, correctly, اِحْوِيَّآءٌ, because the ى changes the و [after
it] into ى, as it does in أَيَّامٌ [which is originally
أَيْوَامٌ]; (TA;) and ↓ اِحْوَوَّى, (ISd, K,) [accord.
to the pronunciation of the Koofees, as will be
seen below, originally اِحْوَوَّوَ,] said by IB to be
found thus written in some of the copies of the
book of As, [that entitled كِتَابُ الفَرَسِ,] but to be
a mistake, because it is agreed that there is not
in the language a verb ending with three letters
of the same kind except اِبْيَضَضَّ [for اِبْيَضَّ];
(TA;) and ↓ حَوِىَ, (As, S, K,) like رَضِىَ, (K,)
[originally حَوِوَ,] aor. يَحْوِى, inf. n. حُوَّةٌ, (As,
S,) or حَوًى; (K;) this last verb mentioned by
As as used by some of the Arabs. (S.) And
الأَرْضُ ↓ اِحْوَاوَتِ The land was, or became, green;
as also ↓ اِحْوَوَّت; (K;) [or the latter is correctly
اِحْوَوَت:] IJ says that ↓ اِحْوَاوَت is of the measure
اِفْعَالَّت, [originally اِحْوَاوَّت, then احْوَاوَوَت. and
then اِحْوَاوَت,] and that the Koofees say اِحْوَاوَّت
and ↓ اِحْوَوَّت; but ISd says that their usage is
wrong, for the Arabs say اِحْوَوَى, like اِرْعَوَى, and
do not say اِحْوَوَّ. (TA.)

حُوَّةٌ [A brown colour;] redness inclining to
blackness: (As, S, K:) or a colour intermixed
with [the blackish red termed] كُمْتَةٌ, like the rust
of iron: (S:) or blackness inclining to greenness.
(K.) In the lip, [The brownish colour termed]
سُمْرَةٌ; (S;) [i. e.] a colour resembling [that
termed] اللَّعَسُ and اللَّمَى: (T, TA:) or a blackness in the lips; which is approved. (Ham
p. 386.)
أَحْوَى Of the colour termed حُوَّةٌ [q. v. suprà]:
and also black: (K:) or black by reason of [intense] خُضْرَة [by which may be here meant either
greenness, or dark, or ashy, dust-colour]: (TA:)
applied to a horse, i. q. كُمَيْتٌ [i. e. bay] overspread with blackness; (TA;) or red in the back;
(En-Nadr, TA;) or more yellow than, but nearly
the same as, such as is termed أَحَمُّ, so that one
swears, of such a horse, that he is أَحَمّ: (AO,
TA: [see مُحْلِفٌ:]) applied to a camel, whose
خُضْرَة [here meaning dark, or ashy, dust-colour]
is intermixed with blackness and yellowness: (S:)
applied to a man, having [a brownish colour such
as is termed] سُمْرَةٌ in the lip; (S;) or having a
blackness in the lips, which is approved; (Ham
p. 386;) fem. حَوَّآءُ, applied to a woman, (S,) and
also to a lip (شَفَةٌ) as meaning red inclining to
blackness: (K:) applied to a plant, inclining to
blackness by reason of its intense greenness; (K;)
and such is the softest of plants: (TA:) the pl.
is حُوٌّ; occurring in a trad., in which the best
of horses are said to be those thus termed: (TA:)
the dim. of أَحْوَى is ↓ أُحَيْوٍ, in the dial. of him
who says أُسَيْوِدُ [instead of أُسَيِّدُ, dim. of أَسْوَدُ];
but there is a difference of opinion as to the form
with idghám: 'Eesà Ibn-'Omar says ↓ أُحَىٌّ,
making it perfectly decl., which Sb pronounces
a mistake: 'Amr Ibn-El-'Alà, or Aboo-'Amr
Ibn-El-'Alà, (accord. to different copies of the
S,) says ↓ أُحَىٍّ, after the manner of أُحَيْوٍ, which,
also, Sb disallows: Yoo says ↓ أُحَىُّ, and this,
says Sb, is the regular and right form. (S.)
[Hence,] بَكْرَةٌ حَوَّآءٌ A sheave of a pulley formed
of black wood. (TA.) And نَمْلٌ حُوٌّ Red ants;
called نَمْلُ سُلَيْمَانَ. (TA.) فَجَعَلَهُ غُثَآءً أَحْوَى,
in the Kur [lxxxvii. 5], means, accord. to Fr, And
hath made it (the herbage mentioned before)
dried up, black by reason of oldness: or it may
mean and hath made it to become غثآء [or decayed,
or dried-up, leaves and stalks,] after it has been
green. (TA.)
أَحْوِىٌّ rel. n. of أَحْوَى. (TA.)
أُحَىُّ and أُحَىٌّ and أُحَىٍّ: see أحْوَى.
أُحَيْوٍ: see أَحْوَى.
