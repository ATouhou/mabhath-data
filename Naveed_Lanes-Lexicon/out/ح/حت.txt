and a male ostrich. (K.) The Hudhalee says,
(S,) namely, El-Aalam, (TA,)
على حَتِّ البُرَايَةِ زَمْخَرِىِّ السْ
سَوَاعِدِ ظَلَّ فِى شَرْىٍ طِوَالِ
(S, TA:) he likens himself, says As, in his running and fleeing, to a male ostrich, as is shown
by what precedes this verse: (S:) by حتّ البراية
is said to be meant حَتٍّ عِنْدَ البُرَايَةِ, i. e. (tropical:)  fleet, or
swift, when emaciated by journeying; the subst.
براية being said to be put for the inf. n. بَرْى:
(A, * L:) some of the Basrees say that the poet
means a camel; but As disapproves of this, because to that which he here describes he has
before applied the epithet هِجَفّ: ISd says that
in his opinion he likens his horse or his camel to
a male ostrich, because of the epithet هجفّ, preceding, and because neither the horse nor the
camel eats the colocynth, but this plant is cropped
by ostriches; شرى meaning the colocynth: IJ
says that شرى here signifies a tree of which bows
are made; and the poet means that if the trees
thus called are tall, they conceal him, and he is
the more lonesome, or sad; and that if they were
short, his eye would range freely, and he would
be pleased, and would run gently. (L.)
-A2-  See
also حَتَّى, near the end of the paragraph.
حُتٌّ, applied to سوِيق, i. q. مَلْتُوتٌ [i. e. Moistened, or stirred about, with water, &c.]. (K.)

of peel or bark or crust or the like. (TA.)
حَتَاتٌ Cries, shouts, noises, or clamour; or a
confusion, or mixture, of cries or shouts or noises,
or of crying or shouting or noise. (K.)
حُتَاتٌ What is rubbed and scraped off; or
what becomes scattered, strewn, or dispersed; or
what becomes so by degrees, part after part; of
a thing. (S, TA.) A word of this class generally
ends with ة; (TA;) [as قُلَامَةٌ and نُجَارَةٌ &c.;
but ↓ حُتَاتَهٌ seems to be also used in the same
sense: and hence the phrase,] مَافِى يَدِى مِنْهُ
حُتَاتَهٌ, so in the A, but in the K ↓ حَتٌّ, (TA,)
There is not aught of it in my hand. (A, K,
TA.) ―

latter, a tree that scatters its leaves. (TA.)
حُتَاتَةٌ: see حُتَاتٌ.
حَتَّى is a particle, used in three senses: (Mughnee:) it is a particle denoting the end of an extent; (Mughnee, K;) which is its predominant
meaning; (Mughnee;) asserted by some to be
always its meaning: (TA:) and denoting a cause,
or motive: and syn. with إِلَّا as an exceptive;
(Mughnee, K;) which last is the rarest, and is
mentioned by few. (Mughnee.) ―
-b2-  It is used as
a preposition governing the gen. case, in the same
manner as إِلَى (S, Mughnee) in respect of meaning and government, (Mughnee,) denoting the
end of an extent; (S;) [signifying To, till, until,
or to the time of;] but the word that it so governs
must be a noun properly so called, not a pronoun
except in a case of poetic license; and must
signify the last part, or portion, of what is signified by that which precedes حتّى, as in the saying,
أَكَلْتُ السَّمَكَةَ حَتَّى رَأْسِهَا [I ate the fish, even to its
head]; or must be prefixed to the word signifying
that part, or portion, as in the saying, [in the
Kur xcvii. last verse,] سَلَامٌ هِىَ حَتَّى مَطْلَعِ الفَجْرِ
[A night of peace, or of salutation, is it, until the
time of the rising of the dawn]. (Mughnee.) It
is also followed by a mansoob aor., as in سِرْتُ
حَتَّى أَدْخُلَهَا [I journeyed until I entered it, ادخلها
here virtually meaning دَخَلْتُهَا], أَنْ being here
understood after حتّى, and the ان together with
the verb being rendered in grammatical analysis
by an inf. n. governed in the gen. case by حتّى
[so that حتّى ان ادخلها means حتّى دُخُولِى إِيَّاهَا]:
this is one of the cases in which حتّى differs from
إِلَى; for one may not say, سِرْتُ إِلَى أَدْخُلَهَا [with
أَنْ understood after الى]: and in the same sense
it is used in the phrase, [in the Kur xx. 93,] حَتَّى
يَرْجِعَ إِلَيْنَا مُوسَى [Until Moses return to us].
(Mughnee.) ―
-b3-  It is also syn. with كَىْ, denoting
a cause or motive [of action &c., signifying To
the end that, in order that, or so that], as in the
saying, أَسْلِمْ حَتَّى تَدْخُلَ الجَنَّةَ [Become a Muslim, to the end that, or in order that, or so that,
thou mayest enter Paradise]; being in this case,
likewise, followed by a mansoob aor. (Mughnee.)
―
-b4-  It is also used [as a preposition virtually governing the gen. case, أَنْ being understood after
it,] in the sense of إِلَّا, meaning Except, or unless,
likewise followed by a mansoob aor., as in the
following verse:
لَيْسَ العَطَآءُ مِنَ الفُضُولِ سَمَاحَةً
حَتَّى تَجُودَ وَمَا لَدَيْكَ قَلِيلُ
[The giving of superfluities is not liberality:
(giving is not liberality) except, or unless, (or
here we may also say until,) thou be bountiful
when little is in thy possession]. (Mughnee.) ―
-b5-
It is also a conjunction, like وَ, [signifying And,
or rather even,] (S, Mughnee,) but on three conditions: first, that the word following it and
conjoined by it be a noun properly so called, not
a pronoun: secondly, that this noun signify a
part, or portion, of what is signified by that
which precedes حتّى, as in قَدِمَ الحُجَّاجُ حَتَّى
المُشَاةُ [The pilgrims arrived: even those on foot],
and أَكَلْتُ السَّمَكَةَ حَتّى رَأْسَهَا [I ate the fish: even
its head]: thirdly, that the noun following it and
conjoined by it denote either the greatest or the
least [literally or figuratively] of what are included in the signification of the noun that precedes حتّى, as in مَاتَ النَّاسُ حَتَّى الأَنْبِيَآءُ [Men
have died: even the prophets], and زَارَكَ النَّاسُ حَتَّى
الحَجَّامُونَ [The people visited thee: even the
cuppers]. (Mughnee.) ―
-b6-  It is also used as an
inceptive particle, (S, Mughnee,) preceding a
nominal proposition, (Mughnee,) as in the following verse (of Jereer [so in a copy of the S]):
فَمَا زَالَتِ القَتْلَى تَمُجَّ دِمَآءَهَا
بِدِجْلَةَ حَتَّى مَآءُ دِجْلَةَ أَشْكَلُ
[And the slain ceased not to emit their blood into
the Tigris, so that the water of the Tigris was of
a mixed colour consisting of red and white]: (S,
Mughnee:) and preceding a verbal proposition,
of which the verb is a pret., as in the phrase,
[in the Kur vii. 93,] حَتَّى عَفَوْا وَقَالُوا [So that
they became numerous, and said]: (Mughnee:)
and preceding a marfooa aor., as in the phrase,
[in the Kur ii. 210,] حَتَّى يَقُولُ الرَّسُولُ [So that
the Apostle said, or, as in the S, so that this was
the case: the Apostle said], accord. to him who
reads يَقُولُ; (IHsh, in De Sacy's “ Anthol.
Gramm. Ar.,” p. 82 of the Arabic text;) others
reading يَقُولَ, which, as well as يَقُولُ, here means
قَالَ. (Jel.) ―
-b7-  [Respecting the cases in which
the mansoob aor. is used after حاّى, and those
in which the marfooa aor. is used, the following
observations are made.] When حتّى precedes a
future, the latter is mansoob, by reason of أَنْ understood before it, as in the saying, سِرْتُ إِلى
الكُوفَةِ حَتَّى أَدْخُلَهَا [I journeyed to El-Koofeh
until I entered it: see above]: (S:) it is not
mansoob unless the verb is a future: if it is
future with respect to the time of speaking, it
must be mansoob, as in حَتَّى يَرْجِعَ إِلَيْنَا مُوسَى
[cited above]: if the verb is future with respect
to what precedes, only, it may be mansoob, as in
حَتَّى يَقُولَ الرَّسُولُ [mentioned above]; or it may be
marfooa; but not unless [somehow] denoting a present time; (Mughnee;) and if present with respect
to the time of speaking, it must be marfooa, as in
the saying, سِرْتُ إِلَى الكُوفَةِ حَتَّى أَدْخُلُهَا [I have
journeyed to El-Koofeh so that now I am entering it]; (S, Mughnee; *) but if not really present,
it is not marfooa unless denoting a past event as
though it were present, as in حَتَّى يَقُولُ الرَّسُولُ
[explained above]; nor may it be marfooa
unless denoting an effect of what precedes it;
so that you may not say, سِرْتُ حَتَّى تَطْلُعُ الشَّمْسُ,
nor مَا سِرْتُ حَتَّى أَدْخُلُهَا unless the ما is regarded
as prefixed to the entire affirmative phrase that
follows it, nor هَلْ سِرْتَ حَتَّى تَدْخُلُهَا; nor may
it be marfooa unless it denote a complement to
what precedes it, so that you may not say سيْرى
حَتَّى أَدْخُلُهَا, as the inchoative would in this case
be without an enunciative. (Mughnee.) ―
-b8-  [The
following verse of El-Farezdak is cited in the
Mughnee as an ex. of حتّى used as an inceptive
particle:
فَوَاعَجَبَا حَتَّى كُلَيْبٌ تَسُبُّنِى
كَأَنَّ أَبَاهَا نَهْشَلٌ وَمُجَاشِعُ
and it is there added that يَسُبُّنِى النَّاسُ must be
understood in this verse before حتّى: but I rather
think that حتّى is here a conjunctive particle, and
that the meaning is, And alas, my wonder! the
people revile me: even Kuleyb revile me, as
though their father were Nahshal and as though
he were Mujáshi'.] ―
-b9-  It should be observed that
حتُّى may be used in three different ways in some
sentences: thus you may say, using it as a preposition (in the sense of إِلَى), أَكَلْتُ السَّمَكَةَ حَتَّى
رَأْسِهَا [I ate the fish, even to its head]; and, using
it as a conjunction, حَتَّى رَأْسَهَا [even its head];
and, using it as an inceptive particle, حَتَّى رَأْسُهَا
[for حَتَّى رَأْسُهَا مَأْكُولٌ so that its head was eaten].
(Mughnee.) ―
-b10-  It is said in the K that حتّى
renders makhfood and marfooa and mansoob;
and that therefore Fr said, أَمُوتُ وَفِى نَفْسِى مِنْ
حَتَّى شَىْءٌ [“ I shall die with something respecting
حتّى (remaining unsettled) in my mind ”]: this is
said on the supposition that حتّى deviates in
government from an established rule, which is,
that a particle which governs one part of speech
governs that only; those, for instance, which
render mansoob and mejzoom governing verbs
only, and the particles that govern nouns governing none but nouns: but the truth is, that حتّى
governs only the gen. case; a marfooa noun or
aor. after it would be so without it, as حتّى in
this case is only an inceptive particle; and a
mansoob aor. after it is rendered so by أَنْ understood, so that حتّى in this case virtually governs
a noun in the gen. case [as has been shown
above]: therefore the remark quoted above from
the K is faulty, and confounds things that should
be distinguished. (MF, TA.) ―
-b11-  Some say that
حتّى is [a noun] of the measure فَعْلَى, from
↓ الحَتُّ the ceasing from a thing, having finished
it; or the becoming unoccupied by a thing; like
شَتَّى from الشَّتُّ: but Az disapproves of this,
because, were it so, the pronunciation termed
إِمَالَة would be allowable in its case, and it is not
so: حتّى, he says, is a particle, not a noun, nor
a verb. (TA.) ―
-b12-  حَتَّامَ is originally حَتَّى مَا [Till
when? until when? or how long?]: the ا of ما
is elided because the expression is used interrogatively, like as it is when any preposition is prefixed to it if used interrogatively, as in بِمَ and
فِيمَ and عَمَّ. (S.) ―
-b13-  In the dial. of Hudheyl,
عَتَّى is said for حَتَّى. (L.)
مَا تَرَكُوا إِلَّا رِمْدَةَ حَتَّانَ, or حَتَّانٍ, (as in different copies of the K in art. رمد,) They left not
of them so much as thou mightest rub thy hands
therewith and then blow it away in the wind
after rubbing it off. (K ubi suprà.)
حَتْحَتٌ: see حَتٌّ.
حَتْحَتَةٌ (tropical:)  Quickness, (K, TA,) and haste, in
anything. (TA.) [App. an inf. n., of which the
verb is ↓ حَتْحَتَ.] Hence the prov., شَرُّ السَّيْرِ
الحَتْحَتَهُ (tropical:)  [The worst pace is that which is quick
and hasty: but in Freytag's “ Ar. Prov. ” (i. 654,)
الحَقْحَقَة]. (TA.)
حَتْحَاتٌ i. q. حَثْحَاثٌ [Quick, or swift, &c.]. (K.)
مِحْتَاتٌ: see حَتُوتٌ.
