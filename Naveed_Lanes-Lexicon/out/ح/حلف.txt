حلف1
حَلَفَ, aor.
حَلِفَ, inf. n. حَلِفٌ and حَلْفٌ (S,
Msb, K) and حِلْفٌ (K) and مَحْلُوفٌ, (S, K,)
like مَجْلُودٌ and مَعْقُولٌ and مَعْسُورٌ, (S,) and
مَحْلُوفَةٌ (Lth, K) [and مَحْلُوفَآءُ, like مَشْعُورَآءُ, as
will be seen from what follows], He swore. (S.)
You say, حَلَبَ بِاللّٰهِ [He swore by God]. (Msb.)
[And حَلَفَ إِنّهُ كَذَا He swore it was so. And
حَلَفَ لَهُ عَلَى كَذَا He swore to him to do such a
thing.] And حَلَفَ يَمِينًا (T in art. ثنى, &c.) and
عَلَى يَمِينٍ (El-Jámi' es Sagheer voce مَنْ, &c.)
[He swore an oath]. And لَا وَمَحْلُوفَائِهِ لَا أَفْعَلُ
[No, by the swearing it, (meaning no, I swear
it,) I will not do such a thing]. (Ibn-Buzurj, K. *)
And مَحْلُوفَةً بِاللّٰهِ, meaning أَحْلِفُ مَحْلُوفَةً, i. e.
[I swear] an oath [by God]. (Lth, K.) Accord.
to IAth, the primary signification of حَلِفٌ is The
act of confederating, or making a compact or confederacy, to aid, or assist; and making an agreement: [but this meaning is afterwards said in the
TA to be tropical:] when the object of this, in
the time of paganism, was to aid in sedition or the
like, and in fighting, and incursions into the territories of enemies, it was forbidden by Mohammad: when the object was to aid the wronged,
and for making close the ties of relationship, and
the like, he confirmed it. (TA.)

and ↓ حلّفهُ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَحْلِيفٌ; (Msb,

Msb, K;) [He made him to swear: and ↓ the
last, he asked him, or required him, to swear:
and he conjured him, or adjured him; as is shown
in the M in art. بلو; (see 8 in that art. in the

[Hence,] أَحْلَفَ الغُلَامُ The boy passed the time
when he had nearly attained to puberty: (K:)
so says Lth; adding that some say, قَدْ أُحْلِفَ:
and this Z mentions also, and he adds, so that it
was doubted whether he had attained to puberty:
but Az says that أَحْلَفَ الغُلَامُ in this sense is a
mistake; and that it means only he nearly attained to puberty; so that those who looked at
him differed in opinion; one saying and swearing
that he had attained to puberty, and another saying and swearing the contrary. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And
أَحْلَفَتِ الحَلْفَآءُ The حلفاء attained to maturity.
(IAar, K.) [By الحلفاء would seem to be here
meant the clamorous female slave: for when this
word means a kind of grass, the ا is not that which
denotes the fem. gender, but is a letter of quasicoordination, if its n. of un. be حَلْفَآءَةٌ, as in the
Msb: but accord. to Sb, it is in this sense sing.
and pl.; and as pl., it is fem.; and in a description
of it by Aboo-Ziyád, cited by AHn, it is made
fem.]

and poa cynosuroïdes;] a certain plant, (S, Msb,
K,) [growing] in water, (S,) well known, (Msb,)
of those termed أَغْلَاث: (TA:) Aboo-Ziyád says
of the حلفاء that it seldom grows anywhere but
near to water or to the bottom of a valley; and
is long, or tall, (سلبة,) rough to the touch; seldom,
or never, does any one lay hold upon it, for fear
of his hand being cut; sometimes camels and
sheep or goats eat a little of it; and it is much
liked by oxen: (AHn, TA:) [a coll. gen. n.:]
n. un. ↓ حَلَفَةٌ, (S, K,) accord. to AZ, (S,) or

صَحْرَآءَةٌ: (K: [in the CK like صَحْرَةٌ, and omitted
in my copy of the TA:]) [this last n. un. requires
that the coll. gen. n. should be حَلْفَآءٌ: (see 4,
last sentence:) but] Sb says that حلفاء is sing.
and pl.: [see شَجَرٌ:] (TA:) [as pl., it is fem.;
and it is made fem. in the description by Aboo-Ziyád, cited above:] sometimes it has حَلَافِىُّ for
pl.: and its dim. is ↓ حُلَيْفَيَّةٌ. (O, TA.) أَنَا الَّذِي
فِى الحَلْفَآءِ, occurring in a trad., means (assumed tropical:)  I am
the lion; because that beast repairs to the places
where the حلفاء grows: and [hence,] كَأَنَّهُ أَخُو

Ibn-Ju-eiyeh, (Skr, K, * TA,) means (tropical:)  A sharp
spear-head, (K,) or a spear with a sharp head:
(Skr, TA:) or it means a brisk, lively, or sprightly,
horse. (Skr, K.) Az says, سِنَانٌ حَلِيفٌ means
(tropical:)  A sharp spear-head: and I think that it is
termed حليف because the sharpness of its point
is likened to the sharpness of the points of [the
grass called] حَلْفَآء. (TA.)
حَلَافَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  Sharpness, in anything. (TA.)
وَادٍ حُلَافِىٌّ A valley that produces [the grass
called] حَلْفَآء. (Sgh, K.)

(K, * TA,) and how chaste, or eloquent, in speech!

أُحْلُوفَةٌ: see حِلْفَةٌ.
مُحْلِفٌ (tropical:)  Anything respecting which one doubts,
so that people swear respecting it; (ISd, L, K,
TA;) so called because it occasions swearing:
(ISd, TA:) such is also termed مُحْنِثٌ. (L.)
[Hence,] (tropical:)  A boy of whom one doubts whether he
have attained to puberty. (IAar, TA.) [And
hence] it is said, حَضَارِ وَالوَزْنُ مُحْلَفَانِ (tropical:)  [Hadári
and El-Wezn are two causes of swearing]: these
are two stars: the reason of the saying is that
which is explained in art. حضر, voce حَضَارِ.
(S, K.) Hence, also, كُمَيْتٌ مُحْلِفَةٌ, (S,) or
كميت مُحْلِفٌ, (K,) i. e. (tropical:)  [A bay] not of a clear
hue; (S, TA;) between that termed أَحْوَى and
that termed أَحَمُّ: accord. to the K, of a clear
hue; but this is the meaning of غَيْرُ مُحْلِفٍ.
(TA.) A poet says, (S,) namely Hubeyreh Ibn-
'Abd-Menáf El-Yarboo'ee, also called, after his
mother, Ibn-El-Kelhabeh, (IB,)
كُمَيْتٌ غَيْرُ مُحْلِفَةٍ وَلٰكِنْ
كَلَوْنِ الصِّرْفِ عُلَّ بِهِ الأَدِيمُ
[A bay not of a dubious hue, but like the colour
of the صرف (q. v.) with which the hide is dyed a
second time]; i. e., of a clear hue, so that one
does not swear that she is otherwise than such:
(S, L:) accord. to IAar, not requiring her owner
to swear that he has seen her like in generousness:
but the former is the right meaning. (L.) Also
نَاقَةٌ مُحْلِفَةٌ (tropical:)  A she-camel respecting the fatness of
which one doubts. (TA.)
محلفة [app. مَحْلَفَةٌ]: see حَلِفَةٌ.
