the inf. n., (S, A,) (assumed tropical:)  He, or it, emaciated, or rendered lean: (S, K:) it (a copious flow of milk,
TA) emaciated a she-goat: (K, TA:) (tropical:)  he (a

animal that pregnancy does not emaciate, except
the camel: (S, A:) she fattens in pregnancy.

حَفَرَ, (S,
Mgh, Msb, K,) inf. n. حَفَرٌ, in the dial. of BenooAsad, (S, Msb,) and this is the worse of these two

or became unsound: (Mgh:) and حَفَرَ فُوهُ and
حَفِرَ his teeth cankered. (A.) IDrst says, in the
Expos. of the Fs, that حَفَرَ, aor.
حَفِرَ, inf. n. حَفْرَ فُوهُ,
is trans.; and that the cause of حَفْر of the teeth,
[or the agent of the verb حَفَرَ,] is old age, or the
continuance of a yellow incrustation, [or tartar,]
or some kind of canker that effects them: but
that the verb in the phrase حَفِرَتْ سِنُّهُ, aor.
حَفَرَ,
inf. n. حَفَرٌ, is intrans. (MF.) [The truth probably is, that the former verb is both trans. and intrans., and hence حُفِرَتِ الأَسْنَانُ; and that the
latter is intrans. only.] ―

central incisors: (سَقَطَتْ لَهُ الثَّنِيَّتَانِ العُلْيَيَانِ
وَالسُّفْلَيَانِ:) so in the K: and to these words we
find added, in some copies of the K, لِلْإِثْنَآءَ وَالإِرْبَاعِ;
and then, وَالمُهْرُسَقَطَتْ ثَنَايَاهُ وَرَبَاعِيَاتُهُ: but in
some good and corrected copies, we read, after
السفليان, thus, والمهر للاثناء والا رباع سقطت ثناياه
ورباعياته: to which, in some lexicons, [as in the
S, though the explanation which follows is there
different,] after والارباع, is added وَالقُرُوحِ. (TA.
[This is evidently the right reading; and therefore
I follow it in an explanation in what is here immediately subjoined.]) ―
-b2-  احفر المُهْرُ لِلْإِثْنَآءِ وَالْإِرْبَاعِ
(tropical:)  The colt shed his central incisors, or nippers,
and each of the teeth immediately next to these:
(K: see what next precedes:) or احفر المُهْرُ لِلْإِثْنَآءَ
وَالْإِرْبَاعِ وَالْقُرُوحِ the colt shed his milk teeth (رَوَاضِع),
[the central pair, the second pair, and the third
pair, in each jaw,] and grew others: (S:) or
احفر المهر, [inf. n. إِحْفَارٌ,] signifies, the colt had
his milk-teeth in a wabbling, or loose, state, previously to their falling out; because, when they
have fallen out, their sockets become hollow:
(A:) or the colt had his lower and upper central
pairs of nippers, of his milk-teeth, in a wabbling,
or loose, state: this is during a period extending
from thirty months, at the earliest, to three years:
then the teeth fall out: then a lower and an
upper central pair of nippers grow in the place
of the milk-nippers which have fallen out, after
three years; and the epithet مُبْدِيءٌ is applied
to the colt; and the epithet ثَنِىٌّ is [also] then
applied to him, and continues to be until [again
it is said of him] يُحْفِرُ, meaning, he has his
lower and upper pairs of nippers, of his milkteeth, in a wabbling, or loose, state: then these
fall out, when he has completed four years: then
the term إِبْدَآءٌ is [again] applied to him; [i. c.,
he is again termed مُبْدِيءٌ;] and he is, and ceases
not to be, termed رَبَاعٍ, until [it is said of him]
يُحْفِرُ لِلْقٌرُوحِ [in the TA, تُحْفِر القُرُوح, which is
an evident mistake,] meaning, he has his two
corner nippers [in each jaw] in a wabbling, or
loose, state: this is when he has completed five
years: then the term إِبْدَآءٌ is applied to him as
before described: then he is [also said to be]

-b5-  ↓ النَّقْدُ عِنْدَ الحَافِرَةِ, (S, A, K,)
and الحَافِرِ, (A, K,) is a prov., (S,) meaning,
(tropical:)  The payment in ready money is on the occasion
of the first sentence spoken (Yaakoob, T, * S, K)
by the seller, when he says “ I have sold to thee ”
[such a thing]. (T.) The origin of the saying
was this: horses were the most excellent (K) and
precious (TA) of the things that they possessed;
and they used not to sell them on credit: a man
used to say the words above to another; meaning
that its hoof should not remove until he received
its price: (K:) and he who says عند الحافرة
(since he makes الحافر to mean the beast, الدَّابَّة,
itself, and since its use in this sense is frequent
without the mention of ذَات [prefixed to it],) subjoins to it the sign [ة] of the fem. gender to show
that ذَاتِ الحَافِرِ is meant by this name. (TA.)
Or they used to say this on the occasion of racing
and betting: and the meaning is, when the horse's
hoof first falls upon the dug ground [at the goal]:
(Abu-l-'Abbás, Az, K:) ↓ حَافِرَةٌ, (Abu-l-'Abbás,)
or حَافِرٌ, (K,) signifying dug ground; (Abu-l-
'Abbás, K; *) ground that is dug by a horse's
feet; (Har p. 653;) like as one says مَآءٌ دَافِقٌ,
meaning مَدْفُوقٌ. (TA.) Lth says that the saying
means, when thou buyest it, thou dost not quit
thy place until thou payest ready money. (TA.)
This was its origin: then it came to be so often
said as to be used with reference to any priority.
(K.) ―
-b6-  [Thus,] ↓ حَافِرَةٌ signifies (tropical:)  The original
state or constitution of a thing; that wherein it
was created: and the returning in a thing, so that
the end thereof is brought back to its beginning.
(K.) It is said in the Kur [lxxix. 10], أَئِنَّا
↓ لَمَرْدُودُونَ فِى الحَافِرَةِ, i. e., (tropical:)  Shall we indeed be
restored to our first state? (S:) i. e., to life?
(Fr:) or to the present world, as we were: (IAar:)
or to our first creation, after our death. (TA.)
IAar cites the following verse:
عَلَى صَلَعٍ وَشَيْبٍ أَحَافِرَةً
مَعَاذَ اللّٰهِ مِنْ سَفِهٍ وَعَارِ
meaning (tropical:)  Shall I return to my first state, wherein
I was in my youth, when I indulged in amatory
conversation, and silly and youthful conduct, after
hoariness, and baldness of the fore part of my head?
[I beg God to preserve me from lightwittedness
and shameful conduct.] (S.) One says also,
↓ رَجَعَ إِلَى حَافِرَتِهِ, (A,) and حَافِرِهِ, (TA,) (tropical:)  He became old and decrepit: (A, TA:) [as though he
returned to his first state; or became in a state of
second childishness.] And اِلْتَقَوْا فَاقْتَتَلُوا عِنْدَ
↓ الحَافِرَةِ (S, A, K) and الحَافِرِ (A) (tropical:)  They met,
and fought one another at the first of their meeting. (S, K.) And ↓ فَعَلَ كَذَا عِنْدَ الحَافِرَةِ and
الحَافِرِ (tropical:)  He did so at the first, without delay.
(TA.) And ↓ رَجَعَ عَلَى حَافِرَتِهِ (tropical:)  He returned by
the way by which he had come: (T, S:) or by
which he had come forth. (K.)

is termed حَفْرٌ or حَفَرٌ. (S, TA.) And صَبِىٌّ مَحْفُورٌ

gum. (El-Wá'ee.)
فُلَانٌ أَرْوَغُ مِنْ يَرْبُوعٍ مُحَافِرٍ Such a one is more
elusive than a jerboa that goes so deep into his
hole that he cannot be dug out. (A, TA.)
