حَضَّهُ, (S, A, Msb, K,) aor.
حَضُ3َ, (Msb,) inf. n.
حَضٌّ (S, Msb, K) and ↓ حُضٌّ, (IDrd, K,) or this
latter is a simple subst., (S, K,) and ↓ حِضِّيضَى,
(K,) or this also is a simple subst., (S, TA,) and
↓ حُضِّيضَى, (K,) or this also is a simple subst.,
and is the only instance of the measure فُعِّيلَى;
and of these last two, the former is the more
approved; (TA;) [both of these, accord. to
some, have an intensive signification;] He excited, incited, urged, or instigated, him; syn.
حَثَّهُ; (T, S, A, K;) or حَمَلَهُ; (Msb;) and roused
him to ardour; (K;) عَلَيْهِ to do it; (K;) i. e.
عَلَى الأَمْرِ to do the thing; (Msb;) or عَلَى الخَيْرِ
to do good; (T, A;) or عَلَى القِتَال to fight;
(S;) or it is used as relating to pace, and to
driving, and to any other thing; (M, TA;) and
El-Hareeree says, on the authority of Kh, that
حَثَّهُ is used peculiarly in relation to pace, or
journeying, or marching: (TA in art. حث:)
and ↓ حضّضهُ, (T, S, K,) inf. n. تَحْضِيضٌ, (T,
Msb,) signifies the same; (K;) or has a more
intensive signification; (Msb;) or i. q. حَرَّضَهُ
[which is equivalent to حَثَّهُ with the addition
given above from the K]; (T, S;) and this is
used as relating to fighting: (T, TA:) or تَحْضِيضٌ
signifies the asking, or requiring, with urgency.
(Mughnee voce أَلَا.) It is said in the Kur
[lxxxix. 19], accord. to the reading of the people
of El-Medeeneh, وَلَا يَحُضُّونَ عَلَى طَعَامِ المِسْكينِ;
and accord. to that of El-Hasan, تَحُضُّونَ; [Nor
do they, or ye, excite one another to feed the
poor, or destitute]: (TA:) or nor do they, or
ye, command to feed the poor, &c.: (Fr, TA:)
and there are other readings thereof: see 3 and 6.
(TA.) The grammarians apply to the particles
هَلَّا and أَلَّا and لَوْلَا and لَوْمَا the term حُرُوفُ
↓ التَّحْضِيضِ [Particles of exciting]; and say that
when they are followed by a future, they denote
exciting to an action, and seeking or desiring or
demanding the performance of it; and when followed by a preterite, reproof for not doing
a thing. (Msb.)

يُحَاضُّونَ and ولا تُحَاضُّونَ, meaning, accord. to
Fr, Nor are they, or ye, mindful. (TA.)
6

(S, K.) In the Kur ubi suprà, some read وَلَا
تَحَاضُّونَ (Fr, S, TA) Nor do ye excite one another.
(Fr.)
حُضٌّ, said to be a subst.: see 1.
حَضِيضٌ A depressed piece (قَرَار) of ground at
the place where a mountain ends; (S;) or a depressed piece (قرار) of ground at, or by, the سَفْح
[i. e. foot, or bottom, or lowest part,] of a mountain; or in, or at, the lower, or lowest, part
thereof, (فِى أَسْفَلِهِ,) the سفح being behind the
حضيض; the حضيض being in the part next the
سفح, and the سفح being دُونَ ذٰلِكَ [which seems
to be virtually a repetition, signifying behind that
part, or it may mean above that part]: (TA:)
or i. q. سَفْحٌ: (K in art. سفح:) or a depressed
piece (قرار) of ground: (A:) or a tract (حِجزٌ
[in the CK, erroneously, حَجَر]), and a depressed

low piece (سَافِلٌ) of land or ground: (TA:) and
the ground [in an absolute sense]: (S:) pl. [of
pauc.] أَحِضَّةٌ and [of mult.] حُضُضٌ. (K.) It
has the last of the above-mentioned significations
in a certain trad., in which it is related that a
present being brought to Mohammad, he, not
finding anything upon which to put it, said, ضَعْهُ
بِالحَضِيضِ, meaning بِالأَرْضِ; [i. e. Put thou it
upon the ground;] adding, for I am only a servant; I eat as the servant eateth. (S.)
