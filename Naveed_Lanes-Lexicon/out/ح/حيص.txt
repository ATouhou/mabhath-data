حيص1
حَاصَ عَنْهُ, aor. يَحِيصُ, inf. n. حَيْصٌ and
حُيُوصٌ and مَحِيصٌ and مَحَاصٌ (S, Msb, K) and
حَيَصَانٌ (S, K) and حَيْصُوصَةٌ (TA) and ↓ حَيْصَةٌ,
(K,) [or the last is an inf. n. of un.,] He turned
away from him, or it: (S, A, Msb, K:) and he
returned, or went back, and fled, from him, or it:
(TA:) and عنه ↓ انحاص signifies the same; (S,
K, TA;) and so does عنه ↓ تحايص: (TA:) or
(K) one says of friends, (S, K,) حَاصُوا, (K,) or
حاصوا عَنِ العَدُوِّ [they turned away from the
enemy]; (S;) [and in like manner, اِنْحَازُوا;] and
of enemies, اِنْهَزَمُوا; (S, K;) [and in like manner,
وَلَّوْا مُدْبِرِينَ.] You say also, حَاصَ عَنِ القِتَالِ He
turned away from the fight. (A.) And حَاصَ
عَنِ الحَقِّ He turned away from the truth; he
deviated from it. (Msb.) And حَاصَ عَنِ الشَّىْءِ
He turned away from the thing, and became safe
from it. (TA.) And it is said in a trad. respecting the battle of Ohod, فَحَاصَ المُسْلِمُونَ
↓ حَيْصَةٌ And the Muslims made a wheel away,
desiring flight: or, accord. to one relation, فَحَاضَ
حَيْضَةً, which means the same. (TA.) حَيْصٌ also
signifies The retiring, or going back, from a thing.
(S, TA.) [See also مَحِيصٌ, below.]

حايصهُ, (K,) inf. n. مُحَايَصَةٌ, (TA,) He
acted towards him with artifice, or guile; (K;)
vied with him; (TA;) and strove to overcome
him. (K.) Hence the saying of Mutarrif, related in a trad., when he was asked respecting his
going forth from the pestilence, هُوَ المَوْتُ نُحَايِصُهُ
وَلَا بُدَّ مِنْهُ, may be interpreted as meaning, [It is
death:] we are eager to flee from it [though there
is no avoiding it]. (AO, TA.)

وَقَعَ فِى حَاصِ بَاصِ: see what next follows.
وَقَعَ, (AA, S, A, and K in art. بيص,) and وَقَعُوا,
(S,) فِى حَيْصَ بَيْصَ, (S, A, and K ubi suprà,) and
حيص بِيصَ, (S in this art. and in art. بيص; and
so in the CK ubi suprà, and in a MS. copy of the
K, [though app. contradicted by what follows in
that work, as will be seen below,] or حِيصِ بِيصِ,
(K ubi suprà, accord. to some copies, and so in
the TA,) and حَيْص بَيْصِ, (K ubi suprà,) with
fet-h to the first [letter] of each and to the last of
each, (K ubi suprà,) and with kesr to the first of
each, (S in art. بيص,) or to both, and with fet-h
to the first of each and kesr to the last of each;
and sometimes each of the two [vars., namely,
حَيْص بَيْص and حِيص بِيص,] is made perfectly
decl. in the second [word], (K ubi suprà,) [so
that you say also حَيْصَ بَيْصٍ, and حِيصِ بِيصٍ,
and حَيْصِ بَيْصٍ; (though the copies of the K
differ in respect of these forms, two, for instance,
giving one form, which is written حَيْصٍ بَيْصٍ,
and one adding حِيصٍ بِيصٍ;) for it is said,] the
whole make six dial. vars.; and, accord. to MF,
each of the two [vars.] is sometimes made perfectly decl. in the first [word] also, [so that you
say حَيْصٍ بَيْصٍ, and حيصٍ بِيصٍ,] but this he
may have inferred from what will be afterwards
mentioned on the authority of ISk, (TA in art.
بيص,) and بَاصِ ↓ فِى حَاصِ, (K ubi suprà,)
indecl., with kesr for the termination, the ا being
[originally] ى; (TA ubi suprà;) He fell, (S,
K,) and they fell, (S,) into confusion in respect
of their case, or affair, from which there was no
escape for them: (S and K ubi suprà:) or into
straitness and difficulty: (S:) حَيْصَ بَيْصَ and
حِيصَ بِيصَ are each two nouns made into one,
and made indecl. with fet-h for their termination,
as in the instance of جَارِى بَيْتَ بَيْتَ: or, as
some assert, they are two nouns, from حَيْصٌ
meaning the “ turning away,” and “ retiring,”
or “ going back,” and بَوْصٌ meaning the “ outstripping,” and “ fleeing; ” and بوص is altered to
assimilate it to حيص; and the meaning is, an
affair, or a case, of any kind, from which one
retires, or goes back, and flees. (S.) You say
also, جَعَلْتُمُ الأَرْضَ عَلَيْهِ حَيْصَ بَيْصَ, (S and K,
both in art. بيص,) or حِيصَ بِيصَ, (S ubi suprà,)
and حَيْصًا بَيْصًا, (ISk, and K ubi suprà,) with
fet-h to each, and حِيصًا بِيصًا, with kesr to each,
not compounded, (ISk, and TA ubi suprà,) Ye
have straitened [the earth, or land,] to him, (S
and K ubi suprà,) so that he may not act as he
pleases therein: (K:) or so that he may not
travel therein in search of sustenance, nor employ
himself as he would to make gain. (Nh.) And
إِنَّكَ لَتَحْسِبُ عَلَىَّ الأَرْضَ حَيْصًا بَيْصًا, or, as some
say, حيصِ بيصِ, [i. e., حَيْصِ بَيْصِ or حِيصِ بِيصِ,
meaning, Verily thou thinkest the earth to be
straitened to me, so that I may not act as I please
therein: &c.] (S.) ―
-b2-  حَيْصَ بَيْصَ also signifies
The hole of the rat or mouse. (TA in art. بيص.)
حَيْصَةٌ: see 1, in two places.
حَيُوصٌ A beast (دَابَّةٌ) that takes fright, and
runs away at random; (K;) turning away from
that which its master desires: (TA:) a mule evil
in disposition. (TA.)
مَحِيصٌ [an inf. n.: (see 1:) and also a n. of
place, signifying A place to which one turns
away, or aside; to which one flees; a place of
refuge:] syn. مَحِيدٌ (S, K) and مَعْدِلٌ (Msb, K)
and مَمِيلٌ (K) and مَهْرَبٌ. (S, K.) You say,
مَا عَنْهُ مَحِيصٌ [There is no turning away, &c., or
no place to which to turn away, &c., from
it]. (S.)
