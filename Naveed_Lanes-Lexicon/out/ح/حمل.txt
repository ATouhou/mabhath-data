حَمَلَهُ, aor.
حَمِلَ, inf. n. حَمْلٌ (S, Mgh, Msb,
K, &c., in some copies of the S حِمْلٌ) and حُمْلَانٌ,
(Mgh, K,) He bore it, carried it, took it up and
carried it, conveyed it, or carried it off or away,
(MA,) عَلَى ظَهْرِهِ (S, MA,) upon his back, or
عَلَى رَأْسِهِ upon his head; (MA;) and ↓ احتملهُ
signifies the same: (Msb, K:) or the latter is
used in relation to an object inconsiderable and
small in comparison with that in relation to which
the former is used; as in the saying of En-Nábighah, (TA,)
إِنَّا اقْتَسَمْنَا خُطَّتَيْنَا بَيْنَنَا
فَجَارِ ↓ فَحَمَلْتَ بَرَّةَ وَاحْتَمَلْتُ
[Verily we have divided our two qualities between
us, and thou hast borne as thy share goodness,
and I have borne as my share wickedness]. (TA *
in the present art., and S and TA &c. in arts. بر
and فجر.) Hence, in the Kur [xx. 100], فَإِنَّهُ
يَحْمِلُ يَوْمَ القِيَامَةِ وِزْرًا [He shall bear, on the day
of resurrection, a heavy burden]. (TA.) Hence
also, in the Kur [vii. 189], حَمَلَتْ حَمْلًا خَفِيفًا
[She bore a light burden]; (S, TA;) i. e., [as
some say,] the seminal fluid. (TA.) Hence also,
in the Kur [xxix. 60], وَكَأَيِّنْ مِنْ دَابَّةٍ لَا تَحْمِلُ
رِزْقَهَا [And how many a beast is there that does
not bear its sustenance !], meaning, (assumed tropical:)  does not provide its sustenance, but is sustained by God.
(TA.) يَحْمِلُ الحَطَبَ [lit. He carries firewood],
(A in art. حطب,) or الحَطَبَ الرَّطْبَ [juicy, or

goes about with calumny, or slander. (A in art.

(Msb:) one should not say, حَمَلَتْ بِهِ; or this
is rare; (K;) or one should not say this, but it
is frequently said; (IJ, TA;) [for] as حَمَلَتْ is
syn. with عَلِقَتْ, (Msb, TA,) and the latter is
trans. by means of بِ the former is thus made
trans., (TA,) therefore one says, حَمَلَتْ بِهِ فِى لَيْلَةِ
كَذَا وَفِى مَوْضِعِ كَذَا, meaning She became pregnant with him, or conceived him, in such a night,
and in such a place. (Msb.) حَمَلَتْ is also said

(S, * K.) And حَمَلَ الحَمَالَةَ and ↓ تحمّلها (assumed tropical:)  [He

the quantity of two vessels of the kind called
قُلَّة,] impurity does not appear in it: (O, K, *

الضَّيْمَ, i. e. (assumed tropical:)  such a one refuses to bear, or submit

-b20-  [حَمَلَ لَفْظًا عَلَى لَفْظٍ آخَرَ, aor.
حَمِلَ,
inf. n. حَمْلٌ, a phrase often used in lexicology and
grammar, (assumed tropical:)  He made, or held, a word, or an expression, to accord in form, or in meaning, or
syntactically, with another word, or expression.
One says, يُحْمَلُ عَلَى الأَكْثَرِ (assumed tropical:)  It (a word) is
made to accord in form with those words with
which it may be compared that constitute the
greater number: thus one says of رَحْمَانُ, which
is made to accord in form with words of the
measure فَعْلَانُ, though it has not a fem. of the
measure فَعْلَى, in preference to فَعْلَانٌ, because
words of the measure فَعْلَانُ are more numerous
than those of the measure فَعْلَانٌ. And يُحْمَلُ
عَلَى نَقِيضِهِ (assumed tropical:)  It (a word) is made to accord in
form with its contrary in meaning: thus عِجَافٌ,
an anomalous pl. of أَعْحَفُ, is made to accord. in
form with سِمَانٌ, a regular pl. of سَمِينٌ. And
يَحمَلُ عَلَى المَعْنَى (assumed tropical:)  It (a word) is made to accord
syntactically with its meaning: and يُحْمَلُ عَلَى
اللَّفْظِ (assumed tropical:)  It is made to accord syntactically with its
grammatical character: the former is said when,
in a sentence, we make a mase. word fem., and
the contrary, because the meaning allows us to
substitute a fem. syn. for the masc. word, and a
masc. syn. for the fem. word: for ex., it is said
in the Kur vi. 78, فَلَمَّا رَأَى الشَّمْسَ بَازِغَةً قَالَ هٰذَا
رَبِّى “ And when he saw the sun rising, he said,
This is my Lord: ” here (by saying بازغة) الشمس
is first made to accord syntactically with its grammatical character (تُحْمَلُ عَلَى اللَّفْظِ); and then
(by saying هٰذَا instead of هٰذِهِ) it is made to
accord syntactically with its meaning (تُحْمَلُ عَلَى
المَعْنَى), which is الجِرْم or the like: this is allowable; but the reverse in respect of order is of
weak authority; because the meaning is of more
importance than the grammatical character of the
word. (Collected from the Kull pp. 156 and 157,
and other works.)] ―
-b21-  حَمَلَهُ أَحْسَنَ مَحْيَلٍ (assumed tropical:)  [He

logic, means (assumed tropical:)  He predicated a thing of another
thing.] ―

namely, a camel, &c.] You say also, حَمَّلَهُ الأَمْرَ

which he has had imposed upon him; and upon you,
that which ye have had imposed upon you]: i. e.,

and do not Thou impose upon us a burden, like
as Thou imposedst it upon those before us: O
our Lord, and do not Thou impose upon us that
which we have not power to bear]: (Kur ii. last
verse:) or, accord. to one reading, تُحَيِّلْ, which
