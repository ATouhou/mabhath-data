حرص1
حَرَصَهُ, aor. [
حَرِصَ and]
حَرُصَ, (TK,) inf. n. حَرْصٌ,
(T, S, K, &c.,) He rent it; or clave it: (T, S,
K, &c.:) and he, or it, stripped off, scraped off,
rubbed off, abraded, or otherwise removed, its
superficial part, peel, rind, or the like: (T, K,
&c.:) the former, (Az,) or the latter, (Az, Er-Rághib, B,) is the primary signification. (TA.)
You say, حَرَصَ القَصَّارُ الثَّوْبَ, (S, A, Mgh, Msb,)
aor.
حَرِصَ (S, Msb, TA) and
حَرُصَ, (Msb,) inf. n. حَرْصٌ,
(Msb, TA,) The beater and washer and whitener
rent the garment, or piece of cloth, (A, Mgh,
Msb, TA,) in beating it: (Mgh:) or made holes
in it by beating it: (S, TA: *) or made holes and
rents in it thereby: or abraded its superficial
part thereby. (TA.) And حُرِصَ المَرْعَى The
pasture, or herbage, became entirely consumed,
nothing of it being left; (IF, K;) as though it
were stripped off from the surface of the land.
(TA.)
-A2-  حَرَصَ عَلَيْهِ, (T, S, A, Msb, K, *) aor.
حَرِصَ
(T, S, Msb, K) and
حَرُصَ, mentioned by IKtt and
the author of the Iktitáf, (MF,) inf. n. حَرْصٌ;
(Msb;) and حَرِصَ, aor.
حَرَصَ, (T, Msb, K,) inf. n.
حَرَصٌ; (Msb; [but it seems to be indicated in
the K, by its being said that the pret. is like
سَمِعَ, that it is حَرْصٌ;]) the latter form of the
verb, however, is bad; (T, TA;) though El-
Kurtubee is asserted by MF to have said that the
former is of weak authority; which is clearly
wrong, as the readers of the Kur are generally
agreed in using it; (TA;) He desired it vehemently, eagerly, greedily, very greedily, or with
avidity; he hankered after it; he coveted it; he
desired it excessively, or inordinately: (S, * K, *
TA:) or he desired it culpably; namely, worldly
good: (Msb:) said by Az to be derived from
the first of the significations mentioned in this
art., or, as is also said by Er-Rághib, and
in the B, from the second thereof; because,
says Az, he who does so [may be said by a
figure of speech to be one who] scratches off
the outer skin of the faces of men by his so doing:
but MF regards this as improbable; and says
that most of the lexicologists hold the last to be
the primary signification, and others to be taken
from it: (TA:) حَرَصَ عَلَيْهِ, aor.
حَرِصَ, inf. n. حَرْصٌ,
also signifies he strove, or laboured; exerted
himself; took pains, or extraordinary pains; to
acquire, obtain, or attain, it: (Msb, TA: *) and
↓ احترص signifies the same as حَرَصَ [he desired
vehemently, &c.]: (K:) and he strove, or laboured;
exerted himself; took pains, or extraordinary
pains; to acquire, obtain, or attain, a thing.
(AA, K, * TA.) You say, لَا حَرَسَ اللّٰهُ مَنْ حَرَصَ
[May God not guard him who desires inordinately, or culpably]. (A.) Aboo-Dhu-eyb makes
حَرَصْتُ trans. by means of بِ, in the following
verse:
وَلَقَدْ حَرَصْتُ بِأَنْ أُدَافِعَ عَنْهُمُ
فَإِذَا المَنِيَّةُ أَقْبَلَتْ لَا تُدْفَعُ
[And verily I had purposed to defend them by
repelling aggression from them; but lo, the decree
of death came: it was not to be repelled]: meaning, هَمَمْتُ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Also He was excessively
solicitous, or careful, and fearful, respecting him;
and excessively pitiful, or compassionate, to him.
See حِرْصٌ and حَرِيصٌ.]

inordinately or culpably desirous art thou, or
how greedy or covetous art thou, of worldly
goods!] (A.)
