(IKtt, Msb, MF,) or حَرْكٌ, with fet-h, (K,) as
in the 'Eyn and O, but disallowed by MF, (TA,)
[and probably transcribed from some lexicon in
which, as is often the case, “with fet-h ” relates to
the medial radical letter,] and حَرَكَةٌ, (K,) or
this is an inf. n. of un.; (Msb; [but in general
usage it is not thus restricted;]) and ↓ تحرّك

agitation; shook, shook about, wabbled, tottered,
waggled, wagged, or nodded: or the latter verb,

or he put himself, in a state of motion, commotion,
or agitation: and the latter also signifies he
became active; said of a growing child, and of a
young gazelle &c.: (see حَرِكٌ:)] the former is
