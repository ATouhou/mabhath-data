حَكُ3َ, (S, Msb,) inf. n. حَكٌّ, (S, Mgh,
Msb, K,) [He scratched, scraped, rubbed, grated,
chafed, or fretted, it: or] he scraped off, abraded,
or otherwise removed, its superficial part: (Mgh,
Msb:) حَكٌّ signifies the act of scratching: (KL:)
or the making a body to pass upon another body
with collision: (K:) [as meaning scratching and
the like,] it is with the nail, and with the hand,
&c. (TA.) مَا حَكَّ ظَهْرِى مِثْلُ يَدِى [Nothing
has scratched my back like my hand] is a prov.,
meaning that one should abstain from relying upon
others: and the same meaning is intended in the
following verse:
مَا حَكَّ جِلْدَكَ مِثْلُ ظُفْرِكْ
فَتَوَّلَ أَنْتَ جَمِيعَ أَمْرِكْ
[Nothing has scratched thy skin like thy nail: so
manage thou thyself all thine affair]. (Har
pp. 432 et seq.) The saying, in a trad., إِذَا حَكَكْتُ
قَرْحَةً دَمَّيْتُهَا [lit. When I scratch a sore, I make
it bleed,] means (tropical:)  when I desire an object, I attain it. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] حَكَّ فِى صَدْرِى, and
↓ احكّ, and ↓ احتكّ, (K,) the first whereof, which
is mentioned by IDrd preceded by the negative
مَا, is the most approved, (TA,) (tropical:)  It wrought, or
operated, in, or upon, my mind: (K, TA:) said
of a suggestion of the devil, that comes into one's
mind. (TA.) Or حَكَّ فِى صَدْرِهِ كَذَا, aor.
حَكُ3َ,
means (assumed tropical:)  Such a thing occurred to his mind as a
thing outweighed in probability, or a matter of
suspicion. (Msb.) And you say مَا حَكَّ فِى صَدْرِى
(assumed tropical:)  It did not make an impression upon my mind.
(Har p. 648.) It is said in a trad., الإِثْمُ مَا حَكَّ
فِى صَدْرِكَ (assumed tropical:)  Sin is that which makes an impression
upon thy mind, and induces a suspicion that it is
an act of disobedience, because the mind is not
dilated thereby. (Mgh. [See also حَاكَ, in arts.
حوك and حيك; and see حَزَّ.]) You say also,
مَا حَكَّ فِى صَدْرِى مِنْهُ شَىْءٌ (tropical:)  Nothing thereof was
unsettled, so as to be doubtful, in my mind. (S,
TA.) And مَا حَكَّ فِى صَدْرِى كَذَا (tropical:)  Such a thing

thing that is set up in the place where camels lie
down, at their watering-place, for the mangy

affairs, and been tried, or proved, by them, and

strong and firm, such as would not flee from his
adversary: or the meaning is, I am, exclusively
of [the rest of] the Ansár, a rubbing-post for him
who would oppose me, and with me should the
stubborn be coupled: the dim. form is here used
for the purpose of aggrandizement. (TA.) [See
