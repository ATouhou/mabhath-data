حرد1
حَرَدَ, (S, A, Msb, K,) aor.
حَرِدَ, (S, K,) inf. n.
حَرْدٌ, (S, Msb,) He tended, repaired, betook himself, or directed himself or his course or aim, to
or towards; made for or towards; aimed at;
sought, pursued, desired, or intended; (him, or
it; IAar, K;) syn. قَصَدَ. (IAar, S, A, Msb, K.)
Agreeably with this explanation, some render the
words of the Kur [lxviii. 25], وَغَدَوْا عَلَى حَرْدٍ
قَادِرِينَ. (S.) You say to a man, ↓ قَدْ حَرَدْتُ حَرْدَكَ
I have tended, repaired, &c., to, or towards, thee;
like قَصَدْتُ قَصْدَكَ (Fr, S, * L) and أَقْبَلْتُ قِبَلَكَ.
(Fr, L.) A rájiz says, (S,) namely, Hassán, (so
in a copy of the S,)
أَقْبَلَ سَيْلٌ جَآءَ مِنْ أَمْرِ اللّٰهَ
يَحْرِدُ حَرْدَ الجَنَّةِ المُغِلَّهْ
[A torrent advanced, that came by the command
of God, tending to the fruitful garden]. (S.)
-A2-
Also, aor.
حَرِدَ, (K,) inf. n. حَرْدٌ, (S, L,) He prevented, hindered, impeded, withheld, restrained,
debarred, inhibited, forbade, prohibited, or interdicted; (IAar, S, K;) and so ↓ حرّد, (L, K,) inf. n.
تَحْرِيدٌ. (TA.) Agreeably with this explanation,
also, some render the words of the Kur cited
above: from حَارَدَتْ said of she-camels, meaning
“ they became scanty in their supplies of milk. ”
(S.)
-A3-  Also, aor.
حَرِدَ, (S, L, K,) or
حَرُدَ, (AZ, S, L,)
inf. n. حُرُودٌ; (S, K;) [and app. ↓ تحرّد and
↓ انحرد; (see حَرِيدٌ;)] He (a man) separated
himself from others; (K;) he left, or abandoned,
or forsook, his people, and removed from them;
(AZ, S;) he retired from his people, and alighted,
or took up his abode, in a place by himself. (S.)
-A4-  حَرِدَ, (Sb, S, Msb, K,) aor.
حَرَدَ, (Msb, K,) and
حَرَدَ, aor.
حَرِدَ, (L, K,) inf. n. حَرْدٌ, (Sb, As, T,
IDrd, S, Msb, &c.,) so says Aboo-Nasr Ahmad
Ibn-Hátim, companion of As, (S,) and حَرَدٌ, (T,
S, Msb,) this latter form of the inf. n. sometimes
used, accord. to ISk, (S,) and this is the form
heard by AZ and AO and As from the Arabs of
chaste speech, (TA,) but both forms are chaste,
(IAar, TA,) though the former is the more common, (IAar, Msb,) He was, or became, angry:
(S, Msb, K, &c.:) he was, or became, exasperated
(تحرّش) by one who angered him, and desired to
kill him. (T, L.) And حَرَدَ عَلَيْهِ (A, L) and حَرِدَ
(L) He was angry with him. (A, L.)
-A5-  حَرِدَ, (S,
Msb, K,) aor.
حَرَدَ, (S, K,) inf. n. حَرَدٌ, (S, Mgh,
Msb,) He (a camel) had the disease termed حَرَدٌ
[q. v.]: (K:) he had the tendons, or sinews, of
one of his fore legs relaxed by the cord whereby
the fore shank is sometimes bound up to the arm,
or had them in that state naturally, (S, Mgh,
Msb, *) so that he shook his fore legs, (S,) or so
that he beat the ground [with the fore leg], (Mgh,
Msb,) in walking, or going: (S, Mgh, Msb:) or
he (a camel) had the tendon, or sinew, of his arm
broken, so that his fore leg became lax, and he
never ceased to shake it: the tendon, or sinew,
breaks only in the outer side of the arm, and it
[the arm] seems, when the camel walks or is in
motion, as though it stretched, by reason of his
raising it so high from the ground, and by reason
of its laxness: (ISh, TA:) or he (a beast) raised
his legs very high, in walking, or going, and put
them down in their place, by reason of his being
very short in his step. (L.) ―
-b2-  Also, aor. and
inf. n. as above, He (a man) was oppressed by
the weight of his coat of mail, so that he was
unable to stretch himself out in walking. (K.) ―
-b3-
And, with the same aor. and inf. n., It (a bowstring) had one or more of the several portions of

(K,) He twisted a rope so tightly that the strands
formed knots, and overlay one another: (T, L:)
and he rolled a rope in twisting it (أَدْرَجَ فَتْلَهُ) so
that it became round. (AHn, L, K.) [See also
the pass. part. n., below.] ―
-b2-  And, (K,) inf. n. as
above, (S, K,) He crooked, curved, or bent, a
thing, (S, K,) in the form of an arch. (S.) ―
-b3-
See also حُرْدِىٌ. [It seems to be implied in the L,
that one says حرّد حَائِطَ القَصَبِ, meaning He
bound a حُرْدِىّ (q. v.) upon the fence of reeds, or
canes, of a fold for sheep &c.]
-A3-  Also, (K,)
inf. n. as above, (T, K,) He (a man) betook himself, or repaired, for covert, or lodging, to a
[house, or hut, such as is called] كُوخ, (T, K,)
with a gibbous roof. (K.)
3
حَارَدَتْ, (S, A, K,) inf. n. حِرَادٌ, (S,) She (a
camel) was, or became, scanty in her supply of
milk: (S, A, K:) or ceased to yield milk, or to
have milk in her udder. (K.) ―

إِنْحَرَدَ see 1. ―
-b2-  [Also,] It (a star) darted down. (K.)
حَرْدٌ i. q. قَصْدٌ: whence the phrase, قَدْ حَرَدْتُ
حَرْدَكَ: see 1.
-A2-  Anger; [as also ↓ حَرَدٌ: see 1:]
so in the prov., تَمَسَّكْ بِحَرْدِكَ حَتَّى تُدْرِكَ حَقَّكَ
Retain, or persist in, thine anger until thou obtain thy right. (TA.) Rancour, or enmity which
one retains in the heart, watching for an opportunity to indulge it. (El-Kálee, MF.)

male or female; (K;) as also ↓ حِرْدَةٌ: (As, K:)
pl. حُرُودٌ. (As, S.) ―
-b2-  An intestine, or a gut:
(T:) pl. as above: (IAar:) [or] أَحْرَادٌ signifies
the intestines, or guts, of camels; and is probably
a pl. of حِرْدٌ, like حُرُودٌ, as the مَبَاعِر and the أَمْعَآء
are nearly alike. (L.) Accord. to Lth [and the
K], حِرْدٌ signifies A piece of a camel's hump: but
this is a mistake: it means (as explained above)
an intestine, or a gut. (T.)
حَرَدٌ: see حَرْدٌ.
-A2-  Also A certain disease in the
legs of camels, (K, TA,) occasioning them, in
walking, or going, to shake their legs, and to beat
the ground with them much: (TA:) or a certain
disease in their fore legs; (K, TA;) not in the
hind legs; caused by the cord whereby the fore
shank is sometimes bound up to the arm: (TA:)
or an aridity in the tendons, or sinews, of one of
the fore legs, occasioned by that cord, (K, TA,)
when the animal is young and recently weaned,
(TA,) in consequence of which he beats the ground
with his fore legs, (K, TA,) or [strikes] his breast
[therewith], in walking, or going: (TA:) the
disease thus called is casual; [or generally so;
(see حُرَيْدَآءُ;)] not natural. (T.) [See حَرِدَ.]

رَوَافِدُ, IAar, L,) of a roof: (IAar, Mgh, Msb:)
[the reeds, or canes, which are thus used in the
construction of a roof are tied together in small
bundles, each of which I have generally found to
consist of about five or six: over them is added a
coat of plaster:] pl. حَرَادِىُّ: a Nabathæan word:
