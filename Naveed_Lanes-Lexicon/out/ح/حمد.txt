حمد1
حَمِدَهُ, aor.
حَمَدَ, inf. n. حَمْدٌ (S, L, Msb, K)
and مَحْمَدٌ and مَحْمِدٌ (L, K) and مَحْمَدَةٌ (S,
L, K) and مَحْمِدَةٌ; (L, K, and so in a copy of
the S;) the last of these inf. ns. [and the third
also] extr.; (L;) or the last is an inf. n. and the
last but one signifies “ a praiseworthy quality,”
or “ a quality for which one is praised; ” (ElFenáree, MF;) or the last may be a simple subst.;
(Har p. 392;) He praised, eulogized, or commended, him; spoke well of him; mentioned him
with approbation; (Akh, S, L, Msb;) عَلَى كَذَا
for such a thing; (L, Msb;) contr. of ذَمَّهُ:
(S, L:) accord. to IAmb, formed by transposition
from مَدَحَ: (marginal note in a copy of the MS:)
but it is of less common application than the latter
verb; (Msb in art. مدح;) signifying he praised
him, &c., for something depending on his (the
latter's) own will: thus, the describing a pearl
as clear is not حَمْدٌ, but it is مَدْحٌ: (Kull p. 150:)
or i. q. شَكَرَهُ: (Lh, K:) but it differs [sometimes]
from this; (Msb;) for شُكْرٌ is only on account of
favour received; whereas حَمْدٌ is sometimes
because of favour received, (Th, Az, Msb,) and
sometimes from other causes; (Th;) [and thus]
the latter is of more common application than the
former; (S;) therefore you do not say, شَكَرْتُهُ
عَلَى شَجَاعَتِهِ; but you say, حَمِدْتُهُ على شجاعته
I praised him, &c., for his courage. (Msb.)
حمد also implies admiration: and it implies the
magnifying, or honouring, of the object thereof;
and lowliness, humility, or submissiveness, in the
person who offers it; as in the saying of the
afflicted, الحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ Praise be to God; since in
this case there is no worldly blessing, favour, or
benefit. (Msb.) This last phrase is generally
pronounced as it is written above: but some of
the Arabs are related to have pronounced it
الحَمْدَ لِلّٰهِ, putting the former word in the accus.
case as the absolute complement of the verb
أَحْمَدُ understood: and others, الحَمْدِلِلّٰهِ; assimilating the final vowel of the former word to the
vowel immediately following it: and others,
الحَمْدُ لُلّٰهِ; assimilating the first vowel in للّٰه to
the vowel immediately preceding it: Zj, however,
disapproves of the latter two modes of pronouncing it: some of them also said, بَدَأْتُ
بِالحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ, meaning I began with the saying
Praise be to God. (L.) [See also حَمْدٌ below.]
You say, أَحْمَدُ إِلَيْكَ اللّٰهَ I praise God (Az, A, * L,
K) to thee, or in thy presence: (L:) or with thee:
(Kh, Az:) or I praise to thee God's benefits, and
his blessings, or favours; or I praise to thee
God's blessings, or favours, and discourse to thee of
them. (L.) And حَمِدَ لَهُ أَمْرًا (tropical:)  He approved of
a thing for him. (L, K. *) And حَمِدَ إِلَيْهِ أَمْرًا
(tropical:)  He approved of a thing for him, and commanded, or enjoined, him to do it. (L.) And
جاوَرْتُهُ فَمَا حَمِدْتُ جِوَارَهُ (tropical:)  [I became his neighbour, and did not approve of being so]. (A.)
See also 4. ―
-b2-  Also, (aor. and inf. n. as above in
the beginning of this art., K,) He recompensed,
or requited, him: he gave him, or paid him, his
due. (L, K.)
-A2-  حَمِدَ عَلَيْهِ, aor.
حَمَدَ, (L, K, *) inf. n.
حَمَدٌ, (TA,) He was angry with him. (L, K.)
2
حمّد, inf. n. تَحْمِيدٌ, has a more intensive
signification than حَمدَ; (S;) [He declared the
praises of God: or] he praised God much, with
good forms of praise (بِالمَحَامِدِ الحَسَنَةِ): (T, L:)
or repeatedly; or time after time. (L, K.) تحميد
[used as a simple subst.] has a pl., namely, تَحَامِيدُ.
(A.) [See an ex. voce خَاتَمٌ, in the latter part of
the paragraph.]

احمد He (a man, S) came to a state, or
result, such as was praised, or commended, or
approved; properly, his affair, or case, came to
such a state or result: (S, L, K:) or (so in the
K, but in the L “ and ”) he did, or said, that
for which he should be praised, or commended;
or that which was praiseworthy, or commendable;
(A, L, K; *) contr. of أَذَمَّ. (A.) And احمد أَمْرُهُ
(assumed tropical:)  His affair, or case, was, or became, praiseworthy, or approvable, in his estimation: (K:)
or احمد أَمْرَهُ (as in the L) he esteemed his affair,
or case, praiseworthy, or approvable. (L [agreeably with what next follows].)
-A2-  احمدهُ He found
him (a man, A, L) [or it] to be such as is praised,
commended, or approved; or praiseworthy, commendable, or approvable; (S, A, L, Msb;) contr.
of أَذَمَّهُ: (TA in art. ذم:) he made it manifest
that he was worthy of praise, eulogy, commendation, or approbation: (L:) he approved of his
action, and his course of conduct, or his tenet or
tenets, and did not expose it, or them, to others.
(K.) And أَحْمَدْتُ صَنِيعَهُ (tropical:)  [I found his action
to be praiseworthy, or commendable, or approvable]. (A.) And احمد الأَرْضَ (tropical:)  He approved
the land as a dwelling-place: (A:) or he found
the land to be such as is praised, commended, or
approved; as also ↓ حَمِدَهَا; (L, K;) but the
former verb is the more chaste in this sense. (L.)
And احمد مَوْضِعًا (tropical:)  He found a place to be such
as is praised, commended, or approved, and convenient, or suitable, so that he approved it as a
dwelling-place, or for its pasture. (S, L.)

(تَكَلَّفَ,) praise. (A.) You say, ↓ وَجَدْتُهُ مُتَحَمِّدًا
مُتَشَكِّرًا [I found him affecting, or making a show
of, praise and thanks]. (A.) ―
-b2-  He praised himself. (KL.) [Golius assigns this meaning to
↓ احتمد, as on the authority of the KL; but it
is not assigned to this verb in my copy of the
KL.] ―
-b3-  فُلَانٌ يَتَحَمَّدُ النّاس [app. a slight mistranscription, for لِلنَّاسِ, i. q. إِلَى النَّاسِ, as in an
ex. in the next sentence but one,] Such a one
pretends to men, or shows them, that he is praiseworthy, بِجُودِهِ for his liberality. (L.) ―
-b4-  تحمّد
عَلَيْهِ He reproached him for a favour, or benefit,
which he (the former) had bestowed, or conferred;
or recounted his gifts, or actions, to him; syn.
اِمْتَنَّ. (S, L, K.) One says, مَنْ أَنْفَقَ مَالَهُ عَلَى
نَفْسِهِ فَلَا يَتَحَمَّدْ بِهِ عَلَى النَّاسِ [Whoso expends his
property upon himself, he shall not reproach men
therewith as for favours, or benefits, bestowed]:
(S, A:) or فلا يتحمّد بِه إِلَى النَّاسِ [he shall not
pretend to men that he is praiseworthy on account
of it]: a prov., meaning that a man is not praised
for his beneficence to himself, but for his beneficence to others. (L.)
6
تحامدوا (tropical:)  [They praised, or commended, a
thing, one to another]. You say, الرُّعَآءُ يَتَحَامَدُونَ

another, the herbage]. (A.)
8
احتمد: see 5.

10
اِسْتَحْمِدِ اللّٰهَ إِلَى خَلْقِهِ بِإِحْسَانِهِ إِلَيْهِمْ وإِنْعَامِهِ
عَلَيْهِمْ [so I find it written, as though meaning
Demand thou, of his creatures, the praising of
God, by reason of his beneficence to them, and
his bounty to them: but I think that we should
read اِسْتَحْمَدَ اللّٰهُ, and that the meaning is, God
hath demanded praise of his creatures by his
beneficence, &c.]. (A.)
حَمْدٌ Praise, eulogy, or commendation; &c.
(S, &c. [For further explanations of this word,
and respecting the phrase الحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ and its variations, see 1: and see also شَكَرَ.]) سُبْحَانَكَ اللّٰهُمَّ
وَبِحَمْدِكَ, said by a person praying, means [I
extol, or celebrate, or declare, thy remoteness, or
freedom, from every impurity, or imperfection,
&c., O God, (see art. سبح,)] and I begin with
praising Thee; أَبْتَدِئُ being understood: (Az,
L, Msb:) or by بحمدك is meant الحَمْدُ لَكَ
praise be to Thee: and nearly the same is said
in explanation of the phrase in the Kur [ii. 28],
نُسَبِّحُ بِحَمْدِكَ, that by بحمدك is meant حَامِدِينَ
لَكَ: [see, again, art. سبح:] or by the expression
وبحمدك is meant, accord. to Aboo-'Othmán ElMázinee, and by praising Thee I extol thy
remoteness, or freedom, from every impurity,
&c.; سَبَّحْتُكَ being understood: or the و is redundant, as it is in the phrase, رَبَّنَاوَلَكَ الحَمْدُ [O
our Lord, praise be to Thee], in which the و is
sometimes omitted: or, accord. to Aboo-'Amr
Ibn-El-'Alà, the و is corroborative, as in the
phrase, وَهُوَ لَكَ, for هُوَ لَكَ. (Msb.) لِوَآءُ الحَمْدِ
بِيَدِى يَوْمَ القِيَامَةِ [The standard of praise shall
be in my hand on the day of resurrection (said by
Mohammad)] means that he shall be singularly
distinguished by praise, or praising, on that day.
(L.) ―

-b3-  and حُمَادَاكَ.
-A2-  See also
حَمِيدٌ.
-A3-  It is also said to signify The young one
of the kind of bird called قَطًا: so in the prov.,
حمْدُ قَطَاةٍ يَسْتَمِى الأَرَانِبَ
A young one of a katà desires to make the hares
its prey: applied to a weak man who desires to
insnare a strong one. (Meyd, TA.)
-A4-  See also
what next follows.
حَمَدَةٌ The sound of the flaming, or blazing,
of fire; (S, K;) as also حَدَمَةٌ [from which it is
formed by transposition: see 8: and ↓ حَمْدٌ app.
signifies the same: see حَدْمٌ]. (TA.)
حُمَدَةٌ: see حَمَّادٌ.
حَمَادِ لَهُ Praise, and thanks, be to him: (S,
L, K:) i. e., to such a one: (S, L:) contr. of
جَمَادِ لَهُ [q. v.]. (S and A in art. جمد.) حَمَادِ is
indecl., with kesr for its termination, because it
deviates from its original, which is the inf. n.
[↓ الحَمْدُ]: (S, L:) [i. e.,] it is [a quasi-inf. n.,
(see اِسْمُ مَصْدَرٍ in art. صدر,) being] a proper
name for المَحْمَدَةُ [as syn. with الحَمْدُ]. (Sharh
Shudhoor edh-Dhahab.)
حَمُودٌ: see what next follows.
حَمِيدٌ and ↓ مَحْمُودٌ (S, A, L, K) and ↓ حَمُودٌ
(as in copies of the K, but this seems to be an
intensive epithet,) Praised, eulogized, or commended; spoken well of; mentioned with approbation; approved; such as is praised, &c.;
praiseworthy, laudable; commendable, or approvable: (S, L, K: [in which, as well as in
numberless exs., all these significations are clearly
indicated, though not so clearly explained; the
Arabic words to which they apply exactly agreeing
with the Latin “ laudatus,” which means both
“ praised ” and “ praiseworthy: ”]) the fem. of
the first is with ة, (L, K,) because the signification,
though properly that of a pass. part. n., nearly
agrees with that of an act. part. n.: (L:) you
say, [هِىَ حَمِيدَةٌ She is praised, &c.; and] أَفْعَالُهُ
حَمِيدَةٌ (tropical:)  [His actions are praised, &c.]. (A.)
↓ حَمْدٌ, also, [originally an inf. n., like its contr.
ذَمٌّ,] used as an epithet applied to a man, is syn.
with مَحْمُودٌ; (K;) and as an epithet applied to
a woman, syn. with مَحْمُودَةٌ, (TA,) as is also
حَمْدَةٌ: (K, TA:) and you likewise say مَنْزِلٌ
حَمْدٌ (K) and مَنْزِلَهٌ حَمْدَةٌ (Lh) (assumed tropical:)  A place where
one alights, sojourns, or abides, such as is praised,
or approved, (K, TA,) and convenient, or suitable.

(L.) ↓ المَقَامُ المَحْمُودُ [mentioned in the Kur
xvii. 81] means (assumed tropical:)  The station in which its occupant shall be praised by all creatures [on the day
of resurrection] because of his being quickly reckoned with, and relieved from long standing: or it
is the station of the intercessor. (L.)
حُمَادَاكَ أَنْ تَفْعَلَ كَذَا (S, L, K *) and ↓ حَمْدُكَ
(L) The utmost of thy power, or of thine ability,

an ex. of the pl. in what follows,) will be] thy
doing such a thing; syn. مَبْلَغُ جَهْدِكَ, (L,) or
قُصَارَاكَ, (S, L,) and غَايَتُكَ: (S, L, K:) and in
like manner, حُمَادِى The utmost of my power,
&c. (K.) حُمَادَيَاتُ النِّسَآءِ غَضُّ الطَّرْفِ, said by
Umm-Selemeh, means The utmost of the praiseworthy qualities of women is the lowering of the
eye. (L.)
حَمَّادٌ (TA) and ↓ حُمَدَةٌ (A, K) A man (TA)
who praises things much; a great, or frequent,

praises things much and extravagantly. (S.)

God much, or repeatedly, or time after time.
(L, K.)
العَوْدُ أَحْمَدُ is a prov., (S,) meaning (tropical:)  Repetition
is more attributive of praise (أَكْثَرُ حَمْدًا): (S,
A, K:) for generally you do not desire to return
to a thing save after experience, or knowledge,
[and approbation,] thereof: [the act of returning,
therefore, implies praise:] or the meaning is,
when one begins a kind act, he attracts praise to
himself; and when one repeats, he gains more
praise for himself: or احمد is from the pass.
part. n., and the meaning is, the beginning is
praised, or praiseworthy; and repetition is more
deserving of being praised. (K.) [See Freytag's
Arab. Prov. ii. 130]

be, praised, commended, or approved: (Mgh:)
