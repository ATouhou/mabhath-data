حس1
حَسڤ3َحَسَّ, (first pers. حَسِسْتُ, or حَسَسْتُ, and
حَسِيتُ, and حَسَيْتُ, and حَسْتُ,) as syn. with
أَحَسَّ: see 4, throughout. ―
-b2-  حَسَّ لَهُ, first pers.
حَسَسْتُ, aor.
حَسِ3َ; (S, K;) and first pers. حَسِسْتُ,
[aor.
حَسَ3َ;] (Yaakoob, S, K;) inf. n. حِسٌّ (S, K)
and حَسٌّ, (K,) or the latter is inf. n. of both verbs,
but the former is a simple subst., (TA,) He was,
or became, tender, or compassionate, towards
him: (S, K:) [lit., he felt for him:] ISd says
that, for رَقَقْتُ لَهُ, the explanation of حسستُ له,
he found in the book of Kr the verb written with
ف and ق; but that the former [?] is the right:
(TA:) or he lamented for him; (Aboo-Málik,
TA;) as also لَهُ ↓ حَسْحَسَ. (K, * TA.) The Arabs
say, إِنَّ العَامِرِىَّ لَيَحِسُّ لِلسَّعْدِىِّ Verily the 'Ámiree
is tender, or compassionate, towards the Saadee;
because of the relationship that subsists between
them. (TA.) And Abu-l-Jarráh El-'Okeylee
said, مَارَأَيْتُ عُقَيْلِيًّا إِلَّا حَسَسْتُ لَهُ I have not seen
an 'Okeylee without my feeling tenderness, or
compassion, towards him; (S, TA;) for the same
reason. (TA.) [See حَاسَّةٌ, second signification.]
-A2-  حَسَّهُ, [aor.
حَسُ3َ, inf. n. حَسٌّ,] He made his حِسّ
[i. e. sound, or motion,] to cease. (Bd in iii. 145.)
―
-b2-  Hence, (Bd, ubi suprà,) حَسَّهُمْ, aor.
حَسُ3َ, (S,
A, Bd, Msb,) inf. n. حَسٌّ, (Msb, K,) [and app.,
accord. to Fr, حِسٌّ, or this may be a simple subst.,]
He slew them: (Bd, Msb, K:) and extirpated
them: (K:) or he slew them quickly: (A, TA:)
or he extirpated them by slaughter: (Aboo-Is-hák,
S:) or he slew them with a quick and extirpating
slaughter: or with a vehement slaughter: (TA:)
it occurs in the Kur iii. 145: (S, A:) accord. to
Fr, حِسٌّ, [so in the TA,] in this instance, is the
act of slaying and destroying. (TA.) [Hence,
حُسَّ app. signifies It was utterly destroyed, so
that nothing was left in the place thereof; and so
↓ احتسّ; for it is said that] حِسٌّ and اِحْتِسَاسٌ,
with respect to anything, signify أَنْ لَا يُتْرَكَ فِى
المَكَانِ شَىْءٌ. (TA.) Also حَسَّهُمْ, aor. as above,
He trod them under foot, and despised them.
(TA.) And حَسَّ البَرْدُ الجَرَادَ The cold killed the
locusts. (S.) ―
-b3-  [Hence,] الجَرَادُ تَحُسُّ الأَرْضَ The
locusts eat the herbage of the land. (TA.) And
حَسَّ البَرْدُ الكَلَأَ, (S, K,) or الزَّرْعَ, (A,) aor.
حَسُ3َ, (S,
TA,) inf. n. حَسٌّ, (TA,) (tropical:)  The cold nipped, shrunk,
shrivelled, or blasted, (lit., burned, أَحْرَقَ, q. v.,)
the herbage, (S, K,) or the seed-produce. (A.)
-A3-
حَسَّ الدَّابَّةَ, (S, TA,) or حَسَّهَا بِالمِحَسَّةِ, (A,) aor.
حَسُ3َ,
(S,) inf. n. حَسٌّ, (S, K,) (tropical:)  He curried the beast;
removed the dust from it with the مِحَسَّة. (S, A, K,
TA.) [See a proverb, voce حَشَّ.] Hence the saying of Zeyd Ibn-Soohán, on the day of the battle of
the Camel, when he was carried off from the field,
about to die, اِدْفِنُونِى فِى ثِيَابِى وَلَا تَحُسُّوا عَنِّى تُرَابًا
(tropical:)  [Bury ye me in my clothes, and] shake not off
any dust from me. (S, TA.)

حَسَّسْتُ الشَّىْءَ [a mistake in the CK for
حَسَسْتُ]: see 4.
4
احسّ الشَّىْءَ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. إِحْسَاسٌ,
(Msb,) He perceived, or became sensible of, (وَجَدَ,)
the حِسّ (i. e. motion or sound, TA) of the thing:
(S, K, TA:) he knew the thing by means of [any
of] the senses: (IAth, accord. to his explanation
of الإِحْسَاسُ as signifying العِلْمُ بِالحَوَاسِّ:) he ascertained the thing as one ascertains a thing that
is perceived by the senses: (Bd in iii. 45:) he knew
the thing; or he perceived it by means of any of the
senses; syn. عَلِمَ بِهِ, (Msb,) and عَلِمَهُ, and عَرَفَهُ,
and شَعَرَ بِهِ; (TA;) as also ↓ حَسَّهُ, aor.
حَسُ3َ, inf. n.
حَسٌّ and حِسٌّ and حَسِيسٌ; (TA, in explanation
of the saying in the K that حَسَسْتُ الشَّىْءَ [in the
CK erroneously ↓ حَسَّسْتُ] signifies the same as
أَحْسَسْتُهُ;) and in like manner احسّ بِهِ is syn.
with شَعَرَ بِهِ; (L, Msb;) and so is بِهِ ↓ حَسَّ,
aor.
حَسُ3َ, inf. n. حِسٌّ (L, Msb) and حَسٌّ and حَسِيسٌ;
(L;) or حِسٌّ is a simple subst.: (M, L:) accord.
to Fr, إِحْسَاسٌ is syn. with وُجُودٌ; and Zj says that
the meaning of احسّ is عَلِمَ and وَجَدَ: (TA:) or
احسّ signifies he perceived, or became sensible of;
syn. وَجَدَ: and he thought, or opined: (Akh, S,
K:) and he saw; syn. أَبْصَرَ: and he knew: (K:)
and is trans. in these senses by itself, (Akh, S,)
or by means of بِ: (TA:) and أَحْسَسْتُ بِهِ signifies I knew it certainly; was certain, or sure,
of it; (S;) as also به ↓ حَسِسْتُ, (S, K,) with
kesr; (K;) speaking of news, or tidings: (S:)
and for أَحْسَسْتُ, some say أَحْسَيْتُ, (S, Msb, K,)
changing the [second] س into ى; (S, Msb;)
and أَحَسْتُ, (T, S, L, K,) with a single س, which
is an extr. kind of contraction, (S, K,) but made
in all other similar cases, where the last radical
letter is quiescent; (Sb, L, TA;) and [thus] for
أَحْسَسْنَ, we find أَحَسْنَ; (S;) and in like manner, for ↓ حَسِسْتُ, (S, K,) or ↓ حَسَسْتُ, (Msb,)
some say حَسِيتُ, (T, S, M, L,) and حَسَّيْتُ, (M,
L, Msb, K, [in the CK حَسْتُ, which is the
modern vulgar form,]) and حَسْتُ. (Abu-l-Hasan,
IAar, T, M, L.) You say, احسّهُ بِعَيْنِهِ [He perceived him, or it, with his eye]; (Ibn-Zekereeyà,
TA in art. جس;) and so ↓ حَسَّهُ. (Sgh, TA ibid.)
[In the present art. in the TA, it is said that
حَسَّهُ بالنصل is syn. with أَحَسَّهُ: but بالنّصل is evidently a mistranscription for بِالبَصَرِ.] And it is
said in the Kur [iii. 45], فَلَمَّا أَحَسَّ عِيسَى مِنْهُمُ
الكُفْرَ And when Jesus ascertained their unbelief
as one ascertains a thing that is perceived by the
senses: (Bd:) or opined it; or perceived it, or
became sensible of it: (Akh, S:) or saw it: (Lh,
TA:) or knew it, or perceived it sensibly. (Msb.)
And in the same [xix. last verse], هَلْ تُحِسُّ مِنْهُمْ
مِنْ أَحَدٍ Dost thou see of them any one? (TA.)
You say also, هَلْ أَحْسَسْتَ الخَبَرَ Hast thou known
the news? (TA.) And أَحْسَسْتُ بِالخَبَرِ, and
أَحْسَيْتُ بِهِ, and به ↓ حَسِسْتُ, and حَسِيتُ به, I
knew the news certainly. (S.) And أَحْسَسْتُ الخَبَرَ,
and أَحَسْتُهُ, and ↓ حَسِيتُهُ, and حَسْتُهُ, I knew somewhat of the news. (T, L, TA.) And مَا أَحْسَسْتُ
بِاخَبَرِ, and اَحَسْتُ بِه. مَا, and به ↓ ما حَسِيتُ, and
ما حَسْتُ, I knew not aught of the news. (T,
L, TA.)

تحسّس He listened to the discourse of
people: (El-Harbee, K:) accord. to Aboo-Mo'ádh,
it is (??) to تَسَمَّعَ and تَبَصَّرَ: (TA:) or he
sought repeatedly, or time after time, to know a
thing, by the sense (الحاسة) [of hearing &c.]:
(Har p. 678:) or (so accord. to the TA, but in
the K “ and,”) he sought after, (Msb, K.) or sought
after repeatedly, or time after time, (Msb,) news,
or tidings, of a people, in a good cause; (K;)
تجسّس signifying the doing the same in an evil
cause: A'Obeyd says, you say, تَحَسَّسْتُ الخَبَرَ
and تَجَسَّسْتُهُ; and Sh says that تَنَدَّسْتُهُ is similar
to it; and IAar, that تَحَسَّسْتُ الخَبَرَ and تَبَجَّسْتُهُ
[but this is app. a mistranscription for تَبَحَّثْتُهُ]
signify the same. (TA.) You say also, تحسّس
مِنَ الشَّيْءِ He asked, or inquired, after news, or
tidings, of the thing. (S, TA.) And تحسّس فُلَانًا,
and مِنْ فُلَانٍ, He inquired, or sought for information, respecting such a one; as also تجسّس:
or the former signifies he sought after him for
himself; and the latter, “he sought after him for
another. ” (TA, art. جس.) The passage in which
it occurs in the Kur xii. 87, has been differently
interpreted, accord. to the several explanations
here given. (TA.)

fell off continuously, and became scattered. (K, *
