حَبَا, (Msb, K,) [aor. يَحْبُو,] inf. n. حُبُوٌّ,
(K,) He, or it (a thing, Msb, TA), was, or
became, or drew, near. (Msb, K.) And hence,
(TA,) حَبَوْتُ لِلْخَمْسِينَ I was, or became, or
drew, near to fifty [years]; (S, ISd, TA;) [as
also حبوت الخَمْسِينَ; for] IAar says that حَبَاهَا
and حَبَا لَهَا both have this signification. (TA.)
―
-b2-  حَبَتِ الأَضْلَاعُ إِلَى الصُّلْبِ The ribs joined to
the backbone; (K;) and in like manner, with
the same meaning, one says of the entrails: and
the ribs were near to the backbone. (TA.) And
حَبَتِ الشَّرَاسِيفُ, (K,) inf. n. as above, (TA,)
i. e. [The extremities of the ribs, projecting over
the belly,] were long, so that they were near one
another. (K.) And حَبَا المَسِيلُ The water-course,

said of a man, He went along upon his hands, or
arms, and his belly: (K:) or upon his hands, or
arms, and his knees: or upon his posteriors: or
upon his elbows and knees: (TA:) [or he crept, or

He came not save creeping, or crawling: and
مَانَجَافُلَانٌ إِلَّا حَبْوًا [Such a one escaped not
save creeping, or crawling]. (TA.) Also, said
of a camel having his fore shank bound up to his
arm, He crept, or crawled, along: [or he dragged
himself along on the ground:] and, said of a
camel, he lay down, and crept, or crawled, [or
dragged himself along,] by reason of fatigue:
or, as some say, being constrained to ascend a

(K,) inf. n. حَبْوٌ, (TA,) The ship ran. (K.)
-A3-
حَبَا لَهُ It (a thing) presented itself, or its breadth,
or width, or its side, to him, or it; syn. اِعْتَرَضَ,
(K,) or عَرَضَ; (Mgh;) as do, for instance,
waves to a ship; (TA;) and as clouds, like a
mountain, before they cover the sky. (S.) And
حبا الرَّمْلُ, aor. يَحْبُو, inf. n. حَبْوٌ, The sands rose
up, extending sideways (مُعْتَرِضًا): (TA:) or extended widely. (IAar, TA.)
-A4-  حَبَاهُ, (S, Msb, K,)
aor. as above, (TA,) inf. n. حَبْوٌ (TA) and حَبْوَةٌ,

inf. n. is حِبَآءٌ, (Msb,) or this last also is a simple
subst., (S, * K,) He gave him (S, Msb, K) a thing
(Msb) without any compensation (Msb, K) and
without [receiving] any favour, or benefit: or
in a general sense. (K. [See also حِبَآءٌ below.])
You say, حَبَاهُ كَذَا and بِكَذَا He (God, or a
man,) gave him such a thing without [receiving]

as above, inf. n. حِبَآءٌ, (TA,) He denied him,
refused him, or refused to give him; (K, TA;)

the verb bears two contr. significations. (K.)

-b3-  حبا مَا حَوْلَهُ He defended, protected, or
guarded, what was around him; (As, S, K;) as
also ↓ حبّاهُ, inf. n. تَحْبِيَةٌ. (S, K.) J cites as
an ex. of the former verb, from a poem of Ibn-Ahmar, the phrase لَمْ يَحْبُهَا فَحْلٌ [as though
meaning A stallion did not defend them]; referring to she-camels: but accord. to AHn, it means
did not regard them; being occupied with himself. (TA.) ―
-b4-  You say also, فُلَانٌ يَحْبُو قَصَاهُمْ
and يَحُوطُ قَصَاهُمْ [Such a one fights in their

احتبى He drew together and confined his
back and his shanks (S, Mgh, Msb, and Har
p. 179) with his رِدَآء, (S,) or with a garment,
or piece of cloth, or with some other thing, (Mgh,
Msb, and Har ubi suprà,) when sitting, to be like
him who is leaning [his back against a wall]:
(Har ubi suprà:) he drew his legs against his
belly with a garment, or piece of cloth, confining
them therewith, together with his back, and binding it, or making it tight, upon them, so as to
preserve him from falling, [when he sat,] like a
wall: (IAth, TA:) and ↓ تحبّى signifies the
same: (TA:) or احتبى بِالثَّوْبِ he inwrapped
himself with the garment: or he drew together
and confined his back and his shanks with a turban
or the like: (K:) for the Arabs not having walls
in their deserts to lean against in their assembling,
the man used to set up his knees in his sitting,
and put against them a sword, or surround them
[and his back] with a piece of cloth, or knit his
hands, or arms, together upon them, and rest
against them; this standing him in stead of leaning. (Har ubi suprà.) The doing this in one
garment is forbidden, in a trad., lest, by accident,
what decency requires to be concealed should
become exposed. (IAth, TA.) You say also, احتبى
بِيَدَيْهِ [He confined his legs against his belly with his
hands, or arms, in sitting, to support himself by
so doing]. (S, Msb. *) [See also قُرْفُصَآءُ.] الاِحْتِبَآءُ
with the sword is practised on the occasions of
making a covenant for mutual protection, or war,
or appointing a chief, and the like; because the
sword may be wanted in these cases. (Ham
p. 711.)
حَبًا: see حَبِىٌّ.
حُبَةٌ A grape: (K:) or grapes when they first
grow, from the berry, not from planting: (TA:)
pl. حُبًى. (K.)
حَبْوَةٌ: see حِبَآءٌ.
حُبْوَةٌ a subst. from اِحْتَبَى, (Yaakoob, S, K,)
as also ↓ حِبْوَةٌ (S, Msb, K) and حِبْيَةٌ (K) and
↓ حِبَآءُ and ↓ حُبَآءٌ: (Ks, K:) meaning [The act
denoted by اِحْتَبَى; i. e. اِحْتِبَآءٌ: and also] a
turban, or piece of cloth, or some other thing
with which a man performs what is termed
الاِحْتِبَآءُ: (Har p. 179:) pl. حُبًى (Yaakoob, TA)
and حِبًى. (Yaakoob, S, TA.) [See an ex. from
a trad. voce نَمِرَةٌ: and see also a verse of
El-Farezdak cited voce حَلَّ.] Hence, حَلَّ حُبْوَتَهُ
and عَقَدَ حُبْوَتَهُ mean (assumed tropical:)  He rose, or stood up,
and (assumed tropical:)  He sat. (Har p. 179. The former phrase
is also mentioned in the S.) And the saying,
الحُبَى حِيطَانُ العَرَبِ [The things used for the
purpose of اِحْتِبَآء are the walls of the Arabs:
see 8]. (TA.) And the saying, in a trad. of ElAhnaf (when he was asked in a time of war,
“ When is forbearance? ”), ↓ عِنْدِ الحُبَآءِ [On the
occasion of اِحْتِبَآء]; meaning that forbearance is
to be approved in peace, not in war. (TA.)
الحبوة on Friday, when the Imám is reciting the
khutbeh, is forbidden; because الاِحْتِبَآء induces
sleep, and exposes the purity of the worshipper
to be annulled. (TA.)
-A2-  See also حِبَآءٌ.
حِبْوَةٌ: see حُبْوَةٌ:

A gift. (S, Mgh.) And the first, The dowry of
a woman or wife. (TA.)

-b2-  Also A collection of clouds;
syn. سَحَابٌ; because it creeps along; or from
حَبَا meaning عَرَضَ, wherefore it is also called
عَارِضٌ: (Mgh:) or applied to a collection of
clouds as meaning that presents itself, or its
breadth, or width, or its side, or extends sideways,
(S, Ham p. 785, and EM p. 51,) heaped up,
(EM,) in the tracts of the horizon, (Ham,) like
a mountain, before it covers the sky; (S, EM;)
as also ↓ حَبًا; (S;) so called because near to the

like a child; or from حَبَا; like as سَحَابٌ is from
سَحَبَ, (Ham,) or from سَحَبَ أَهْدَابَهُ: (TA:) or,
as also ↓ حُبِىٌّ, a collection of clouds overpeering
(يُشْرِفُ, in [some of] the copies of the K, erroneously, يشرق, TA) from the horizon upon the

butt, (Kt, K,) having fallen short of it: (Kt:)
or an arrow that glides along the ground, and
then hits the butt: pl. حَوَابٍ. (Msb.) Hence the
saying, in a trad., إِنَّ حَابِيًا خَيْرٌ مِنْ زَاهِقٍ, i. e. An
arrow such as is termed حَابٍ, though weak,
having hit the butt, is better than one that goes
beyond the butt by its vehemence of passage,
and its force, not having hit it: meaning, by the
two arrows, one who attains the truth, or right,
or a part thereof, though weak; and another who
goes beyond it, and far from it, though strong.
(TA.)
-A3-  A thing presenting itself, or its breadth,
