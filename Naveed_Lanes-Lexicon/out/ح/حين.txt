(Mgh, K,) applicable to any time, (Az, K,) little
or much, (Mgh, Msb,) long or short, that may
be a year and more: or [in some cases] particularly meaning forty years: or seven years:
or two years: or six months: or two months:
or any morning and evening: (K:) also a space
of time; (S, K;) as in the Kur lxxvi. I, (S,)
and in the Kur xxxvii. 178: (K:) and a continuous time: (Ham p. 381:) and the day of
resurrection; (K;) or the coming to pass of the
resurrection; as in the Kur xxxviii. last verse:
(Mgh, TA:) or it has two meanings; namely,
a time of unknown limit, and also, as in the Kur
xiv. 30, six months: (Fr, Msb:) accord. to Er-Rághib, the time of a thing's arriving, or coming,
and happening; having a vague meaning, and
rendered particular, or special, by that to which
it is prefixed: some say that it occurs applied in
different ways: to an appointed term; as that
to which God makes one to live: and a year;
as in the Kur xiv. 30: and to the time when
an event takes place; as in the Kur xxx. 16:
and to time absolutely: accord. to El-Munáwee,
in the [genuine] language of the Arabs, it is
applied to [the time of] a glance of the eye, and
more than that, to time without end: (TA:)
the pl. is أَحْيَانٌ, (S, Msb, K,) and pl. pl. أَحَايِينُ;
(S, * K;) as in the saying, فُلَانٌ يَفْعَلُ كَذَا أَحْيَانًا
and فِى الأَحَايِينِ [Such a one does so at times,
or sometimes]. (S.) In the Kur [xiv. 30], تُؤْتِى,
أُكُلَهَا كُلَّ حِينٍ means [Which yieldeth its
fruit] every six months: (Fr, Msb, TA:) or
every year: or every morning and evening: or,
accord. to Az, in every season, uninterruptedly.
(TA.) شَىْءٍ ↓ مِحْيَانُ, also, means حِينُهُ [The
time, or season, of a thing]. (K.) [You say,
إِلَى حِينٍ For a time, or season.] And حِينًا At
one time; sometime; at some time; awhile.
(Mgh.) حِينَ in the phrase قُمْتُ حِينَ قُمْتَ [I
stood in the time when thou stoodest, or I stood
when thou stoodest,] is an adv. n. of time; (Msb;)
[see also an ex. in a verse cited voce خَشَفَ, and
the remarks there subjoined:] and one may well
employ in its place لَمَّا and إِذَا (Msb, TA) and
إِذْ and مَتَى and سَاعَةَ (TA) and وَقْتَ (Msb, TA)
and the like; but not, as many have said, حَيْثُ;
for this is an adv. n. of place. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  When
they make the two times to be distant, the
one from the other, [i. e. the time of speaking and the time spoken of,] they do so by
means of إذ, and thus, (K,) they say حِينَئِذٍ
[meaning At that time; then]: (S, K:) and
sometimes they suppress the ء, substituting for
it ى. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Sometimes, also, they prefix تَ
to حِينَ; (S, TA;) and say لَا تَحِينَ, meaning
It is not, or was not, a time [of such a thing;
but this is generally written لَاتَ حِينَ]; as in
the Kur xxxviii. 2 [respecting which see art.
ليت]. (TA.) Aboo-Wejzeh Es-Saadee says,
اَلْعَاطِفُونَ تَحِينَ مَا مِنْ عَاطِفٍ
وَالمُطْعِمُونَ زَمَانَ أَيْنَ المُطْعِوُ
[The persons who return to the attack when there
is none other that returns to the attack, (as is
said in the S and L in art. عطف,) or it may mean
who act affectionately in the time when there is
none other that acts affectionately; as is said in
the L in that art.;) and the feeders in the time
when it is said, Where is the feeder?]: (S:) ISd
says that ت is thus prefixed to حين like as it
is in تَلَانَ meaning الآنَ: but IB says that Ibn-Es-Seeráfee cites the former hemistich thus:
اَلْعَاطِفُونَهْ حِينَ مَامِنْ عَاطِفٍ
[with the ه of pausation]: and some say that the
ه of pausation is likened to the fem. ة, and is then
made movent with fet-h. (TA. [See more in art.
ليت.]) ―
-b4-  See also حِينَةٌ, in two places.
حَانَةٌ: see art. حون.
حَيْنَةٌ: see what next follows.
حِينَةٌ [The time appointed for a she-camel to
be milked in every day and night;] a subst.
from حَيَّنَ النَّاقَةَ; as also ↓ حِينٌ: you say, مَتَى
حِينَةُ نَاقَتِكَ, meaning When is the time of the
milking of thy she-camel? and كَمْ حِينَتُهَا, meaning How many times is she milked? (K.) One
says also, of a man, (S,) يَأْكُلُ الحِينَةَ and ↓ الحَيْنَةَ,
meaning He eats once in the day and the night:
(S, K:) or, accord. to Aboo-'Amr Ez-Záhid,
الوَجْبَة is used as meaning a man's eating once in
the day, and الحينة as meaning a she-camel's
being milked once in the day. (IB, TA.) And
one says, مَا أَلْقَاهُ إِلَّا الحِينَةَ بَعْدَ الحِينَةَ, i. e. الحِينَ
↓ بَعْدَ الحِينِ [I do not meet him save time after
time; meaning, occasionally]. (K.)

befalls one: (K, TA:) a calamity in which is
الحَيْن: (TA:) pl. حَوَائِنُ. (K.) [In the CK it
is, in one place, erroneously substituted for حَانِيَّةٌ,
as meaning “ wine. ”]
مَحُونَةٌ [mentioned in the K in art. محن] is
from الحَيْنُ or المِحْنَةُ. (TA.)
مِحْيَانٌ: see its syn. حينٌ.
