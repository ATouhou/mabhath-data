حكم1
حَكَمَهُ, (S, K,) [aor.
حَكُمَ,] inf. n. حُكْمٌ, (Msb,
K, [in the TK حَكْمٌ,]) in its primary acceptation,
(Msb,) He prevented, restrained, or withheld,
him (S, Msb, K) from acting in an evil, or a
corrupt, manner; as also ↓ احكمهُ: (K:) and
(K) from doing that which he desired; as also
↓ احكمهُ; and ↓ حكّمهُ, (S, K,) inf. n. تَحْكِيمٌ:
(S:) and حُكُومَةٌ [is another inf. n. of حَكَمَهُ,
and], accord. to As, primarily signifies the turning a man back from wrongdoing. (TA.) Ibrá-
heem En-Nakha'ee is related to have said, ↓ حَكِّمِ
اليَتِيمَ كَمَا تُحَكِّمُ وَلَدَكَ, meaning Restrain thou
the orphan from acting in an evil, or a corrupt,
manner, and make him good, or virtuous, as thou
restrainest thine offspring &c.: and of every one
whom thou preventest, or restrainest, or withholdest, from doing a thing, thou sayest, [حَكَمْتُهُ
and] ↓ حكّمته and ↓ احكمته: or, accord. to Aboo-Sa'eed Ed-Dareer, as related by Sh, the forementioned saying of En-Nakh'ee means let the
orphan decide respecting his property, when he
is good, or virtuous, as thou lettest thine offspring
&c.; but this explanation is not approved. (Az,
TA.) And Jereer says,
سُفَهَآءَكُمْ ↓ أًبَنِى حَنِيفَةَ أَحْكِمُوا
إِنِّى أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمُ أَنْ أَغْضَبَا
[O sons of Haneefeh, restrain your lightwitted
ones: verily I fear for you that I may be angry]:
(S, TA:) i. e., restrain and prevent them from

-b2-  حَكَمَ الفَرَسَ,
and ↓ احكمهُ, and ↓ حكّمهُ, He pulled in the horse

or restrained, him. (TA.) And حَكَمَ الدَّابَّةَ, (S,)
or الفَرَسَ, (K,) inf. n. حَكْمٌ; (S; [so in my two
copies of that work;]) and ↓ أَحْكَمَهَا, (S,) or
احكمهُ; (K;) He put a حَكَمَة [q. v.] to the bit
of the beast, or horse. (S, * K.) ―
-b3-  And ↓ حكّم
الحَوَادِثَ (assumed tropical:)  [He controlled events: see مُحَكَّمٌ].
(MF.) ―
-b4-  حَكَمْتُ عَلَيْهِ بِكَذَا originally signifies
I prevented, restrained, or withheld, him from
doing, or suffering, any other than such a thing,
so that he could not escape it. (Msb.) [Hence
it means I condemned him to such a thing; as,
for instance, the payment of a fine or of a debt,
and death.] And hence, (Msb,) حَكَمَ, (S, Mgh,
Msb, K,) aor.

Msb, K) and حُكُومَةٌ, (K,) He judged, gave
judgment, passed sentence, or decided judicially,
بَيْنَهُمْ between them, (S, Msb, K, TA,) and لَهُ in
his favour, and عَلَيْهِ against him. (S, TA.)
And حَكَمَ عَلَيْهِ بِالأَمْرِ He decided judicially the
thing, or affair, or case, against him. (K, TA.)
And حَكَمَ لَهُ عَلَيْهِ بِكَذَا [He awarded by judicial
sentence in his favour, against him (i. e. another
person), such a thing]. (Mgh.) [And حَكَمَ عَلَيْهِ
He exercised judicial authority, jurisdiction,
rule, dominion, or government, over him. And
حَكَمَ بِكَذَا He ordered, ordained, or decreed,
such a thing.]
-A2-  حَكَمَ عَنِ الأَمْرِ He turned back,
or reverted, from the thing, or affair. (IAar,
Az, K.)
-A3-  حَكُمَ, (S, MA, TA,) with damm to
the ك, (S,) like كَرُمَ, (TA,) [not حَكَمَ as in the
Lexicons of Golius and Freytag,] inf. n. حُكْمٌ
(KL, MA) and حِكْمَةٌ, (MA,) He was, or became,
such as is termed حَكِيمٌ [i. e. wise, &c.]. (S, KL,
MA, TA.) ―
-b2-  And حكم, inf. n. حكم, [so in the
TA, without any syll. signs, app. حَكُمَ inf. n.
حُكْمٌ,] is said of a man, signifying He reached
the utmost point, or degree, in its meaning (فِى
مَعْنَاهُ [i. e., app., in what is the radical meaning
of the verb, namely, in judging; like قَضُوَ]); in
praising, not in dispraising. (TA.)
2
حكّمهُ, inf. n. تَحْكِيمٌ: see 1, in five places.
―
-b2-  Also [He made him judge; or] he committed
to him the office of judging, giving judgment, passing sentence, or deciding judicially; (Mgh,
Msb;) or he ordered him to judge, give judgment,
pass sentence, or decide judicially; (K;) or he
allowed him to judge, &c.; (TA;) فِى الأَمْرِ in
the affair, or case. (K.) And حَكَّمْتُهُ فِى مَالِى
I gave him authority to judge, give judgment, pass
sentence, or decide judicially, respecting my property. (S, TA.) ―
-b3-  Hence, حَكَّمَتِ الخَوَارِجُ The
[schismatics called the] خوارج asserted that judgment (الحُكْمُ) belongs not to any but God. (Mgh.)
تَحْكِيمُ الحَرُورِيَّةِ, in the K, erroneously, ↓ تَحَكُّمُ
الحروريّة, (TA,) signifies The assertion of the
[schismatics called] حروريّة that there is no judgment (حُكْم) but God's, (K, TA,) and that there

And حَاكَمْنَاهُ إِلَى اللّٰهِ We summoned him to the
judgment of God [administered by the Kádee].
(TA.) بِكَ حَاكَمْتُ, occurring in a trad., is said
to mean I have submitted the judgment [of my
case] to Thee, and there is no judgment but thine;
and by Thee [or thy means or aid] I have litigated
in seeking judgment and in proving the falseness
of him who has disputed with me in the matter of
religion. (TA. [The past tense, here, is perhaps
used as a corroborative present.])

أَحْكَمَ see 1, in seven places. The saying of Lebeed, describing a coat of mail,
أَحْكَمَ الجِنْثِىَّ مِنْ عَوْرَاتِهَا
كُلُّ حِرْبَآءٍ إِذَا أُكْرِهَ صَلٌّ
is explained as meaning Every nail repelled the
sword from its interstices: [when it was struck
with force, it made a clashing sound:] or, as some
say, [the right reading is الجنثىُّ and كُلَّ, (as in
the S in arts. جنث and صل,) and, accord. to some,
صَنْعَتِهَا in the place of عوراتها, (as in the S and M
in art. صل,) and] the meaning is, the manufacturer thereof made firm, or strong, every nail
[of its interstices, or of its fabric: &c.]: احكم in
this case signifying أَحْرَزَ [agreeably with the explanation here next following]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  احكمهُ,
(S, Mgh, Msb, K,) inf. n. إِحْكَامٌ, (TA,) i. q.
أَتْقَنَهُ [He made it, or rendered it, (namely, a
thing, S, Mgh, Msb,) firm, stable, strong, solid,
compact, sound, or free from defect or imperfection, by the exercise of skill; he made it firmly,
strongly, solidly, compactly, so that it was firmly
and closely joined or knit together, soundly,
thoroughly, skilfully, judiciously, or well; he so
constructed, constituted, established, settled, arranged, did, performed, or executed, it; he put it
into a firm, solid, sound, or good, state, or on a
firm, solid, sound, or good, footing: and he knew
it, or learned it, soundly, thoroughly, or well; see
1, last sentence, in art. حنك]. (Msb, K.) Hence,
in the Kur [xi. 1], كِتَابٌ أَحْكِمَتْ آيَاتُهُ (TA) i. e.
[A book whereof the verses are rendered valid] by
arguments and proofs; (Bd;) or by command
and prohibition, and the statement of what is lawful and unlawful: (TA:) or disposed in a sound
manner, (Ksh, Bd,) with respect to the words and
meanings, (Bd,) like a building firmly and orderly
and well constructed: (Ksh:) or prevented from
being corrupted (Ksh, Bd) and from being abrogated: (Bd:) or made to be characterized by
wisdom, (Ksh, Bd:) as comprising the sources of
speculative and practical wisdom. (Bd.) And
hence one says of a man such as is termed حَكِيم,
[i. e. wise, &c.,] قَدْ أَحْكَمَتْهُ التَّجَارِبُ [Tryings
have rendered him firm, or sound, in judgment].
(TA.) ―
-b3-  [Hence, أُحْكِمَ عَنْ كَذَا It was secured
from such a thing: see مُحْكَمٌ.] ―
-b4-  [إِحْكَامٌ is also
often used as the inf. n. of the pass. verb, signifying The being firm, &c.; or firmness, &c.: see
مِرَّةٌ.] ―
-b5-  See also حَكَمَةٌ.
5
تحكّم فِيهِ He did [or decided] according to
his own judgment, or did what he judged fit, respecting it, or in it: (Msb:) or he had authority
to judge, give judgment, pass sentence, or decide judicially, respecting it; (K, TA;) as also
فيه ↓ احتكم: (S, K:) each is quasi-pass. of حَكَّمَهُ;
the former regular, and the latter irregular: (TA:)
or the former signifies he pretended to have authority to judge, &c. (KL.) You say, عَلَىَّ ↓ احتكم
فِى مَالِى He had authority over me to judge, &c.,
respecting my property. (S.) ―
-b2-  See also 2.
6
تحاكموا إِلَى الحَاكِمِ They summoned one
another to the judge, [seeking judgment, (see 3,)]
and litigated; as also إِلَيْهِ ↓ احتكموا. (S, TA.)

-b2-  and 6: ―
-b3-  and 10.
10
استحكم He (a man) refrained from what
would injure him in his religion and his worldly
concerns. (Aboo-' Adnán, TA.) ―
-b2-  Also quasipass. of أَحْكَمَهُ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) as signifying
أَتْقَنَهُ; (Msb, K;) [It was, or became, firm,
stable, strong, solid, compact, firmly and closely
joined or knit together, sound, or free from defect
or imperfection, by the exercise of skill; firmly,
strongly, solidly, compactly, soundly, thoroughly,
skilfully, judiciously, or well, made or constructed
or constituted or established or settled or arranged
or done or performed or executed: and, said of a
quality or faculty &c., it was, or became, firm,
strong, sound, free from defect or imperfection,
established, or confirmed:] and, said of an affair,
or a case, it was, or became, in a firm, solid, sound,
or good, state, or on a firm, solid, sound, or good,
footing; as also ↓ احتكم. (TA.) ―
-b3-  استحكم عَلَيْهِ
الأَمْرُ The thing, or affair, became confused and
dubious to him; syn. اِلْتَبَسَ: so in the A. (TA.
[But this seems to require confirmation.])
حُكْمٌ [inf. n. of 1, q. v.,] originally signifies
Prevention, or restraint. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  And hence,
(Msb,) Judgment, or judicial decision: (S, Msb,
K, TA:) or judgment respecting a thing, that it
is such a thing, or is not such a thing, whether it
be necessarily connected with another thing, or
not: (TA:) [whence,] in logic, [what our logicians term judgment; i. e.] the judging a thing to
stand to another [thing] in the relation of an attribute to its subject, affirmatively or negatively;
or the perception of relation or non-relation:
(Kull:) or it properly signifies judgment with
equity or justice: (Az, TA:) and ↓ حُكُومَةٌ signifies the same; (K, TA;) originally, accord. to
As, the restraint of a man from wrongdoing:
(TA:) [each, though an inf. n., being used as a
simple subst., has its pl.:] the pl. of the former is
أَحْكَامٌ, (K,) [properly a pl. of pauc., but] its only
pl. form: and the pl. of the latter is حُكُومَاتٌ.
(TA.) You say, وَ يَفْصِلُ ↓ هُوَ يَتَوَلَّى الحُكُومَاتِ
الخُصُومَاتِ [He presides over the affairs of judgment, and decides litigations]. (TA.) And it is
said in a trad., إِنَّ مِنَ الشِّعْرِ لَحُكْمًا meaning
Verily, of poetry, there is that which is true
judgment: so says Er-Rághib: or, as others say,
profitable discourse, such as restrains from, and
forbids, ignorant and silly behaviour; i. e., [what
contains] exhortations and proverbs profitable to
men: or, the right reading is, as some relate it,
↓ لَحِكْمَةً [i. e. wisdom, &c.]: (TA:) or حِكَمًا [pl.
of حِكْمَة]. (So in a copy of the “ Jámi' es-Sagheer ” of Es-Suyootee.) ―
-b3-  [The exercise of
judicial authority; jurisdiction; rule; dominion;
or government. See also حُكُومَةٌ. ―
-b4-  An ordinance;
a statute; a prescript; an edict; a decree; or a
particular law; like قَضَآءٌ. Hence the phrase
حُكْمَ العَادَةِ According to custom or usage; properly, according to the ordinance of custom or
usage. ―
-b5-  A rule in grammar &c.; as when one
says, حُكْمُ الفَاعِلِ الرَّفْعُ or أَنْ يُرْفَعَ, i. e. The rule
applying to the case of the agent is that it be put
in the nom. case; and حُكْمُهُ حُكْمُ كَذَا, or كَحُكْمِ
كذا, i. e. The rule applying to it is the same as
the rule applying to such a thing, or like the rule
applying to such a thing. ―
-b6-  It may often be
rendered Predicament: (thus the last of the foregoing exs. may be rendered Its predicament is
the same as the predicament of such a thing, or
like the predicament of such a thing:) and حُكْمًا,
or فِى الحُكْمِ, predicamentally, or in respect of
predicament; and virtually; as distinguished
from لَفْظًا (literally), and حَقِيقَةً (really), and the
like.] ―
-b7-  Also Knowledge of the law in matters of
religion. (TA.) ―
-b8-  See also حِكْمَةٌ, in two places.
It is a more general term than حِكْمَةٌ; for all حِكْمَة
is حُكْم, but the reverse is not the case. (Er-Rághib, TA.)
حَكَمٌ: see حَاكِمٌ, in two places; and مُحَكِّمٌ.
[Hence,] الحَكَمُ [The Judge] is one of the names
of God. (TA.) ―
-b2-  A man advanced in age (K,
TA) to the utmost degree. (TA.)
-A2-  See also
حَكَمَةٌ.
حِكْمَةٌ [properly, or primarily,] signifies What
prevents, or restrains, from ignorant behaviour:
(Mgh:) [in its most usual sense, which is wisdom,
agreeably with explanations here following,] it is
derived from حَكَمَةٌ, signifying a certain appertenance of a beast, [a kind of curb,] because it prevents its possessor from having bad dispositions:
(Msb:) it means knowledge; or science; (S, K;)
as also ↓ حُكْمٌ: (S, TA:) or [generally] knowledge of the true natures of things, and action
according to the requirements thereof; and therefore it is divided into intellectual and practical:
or a state, or quality, of the intellectual faculty:
this is the theological حِكْمَة: in the Kur xxxi. 11,
by the حِكْمَة given by God to Lukmán, is meant
the evidence of the intellect in accordance with
the statutes of the law: (TA:) in the conventional language of the learned, it means the
perfecting of the human mind by the acquisition
of the speculative sciences, and of the complete
faculty of doing excellent deeds, according to the
ability possessed: (Bd on the passage of the Kur
above mentioned:) or it means the attainment of
that which is true, or right, by knowledge and by
deed: so that in God it is the knowledge of things,
and the origination thereof in the most perfect
manner: and, in man, the knowledge and doing
of good things: or it means acquaintance with the
most excellent of things by the most excellent kind
of knowledge: (TA:) [and in the modern language, philosophy: pl. حِكَمٌ:] see حُكْمٌ. ―
-b2-  Also
Equity, or justice, (K, TA,) in judgment or judicial decision; and so ↓ حُكْمٌ. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And
i. q. حِلْمٌ; (K, TA;) i. e. [Forbearance, or clemency, or] the management of one's soul and
temper on the occasion of excitement of anger:
which, if correct, is nearly the same as equity or
justice. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And Obedience of God: and
knowledge in matters of religion, and the acting
agreeably therewith: and understanding: and
reverential fear; piety; pious fear; or abstinence from unlawful things: and the doing, or
saying, that which is right: and reflection upon
what God has commanded, and doing according
thereto. (TA.) ―
-b5-  And [Knowledge of] the
interpretation of the Kur-án, and saying that
which is right in relation to it: so in the Kur
ii. 272. (TA.) ―
-b6-  And The gift of prophecy, or
the prophetic office; (K, TA;) and apostleship:
so in the Kur ii. 252 and iii. 43 and xxxviii. 19:
(TA:) or in the [first and] last of these instances
it means ―
-b7-  The Book of the Psalms [of David]:
or, as some say, any saying, or discourse, agreeable
with the truth: (Mgh:) and it also means [in
other instances] the Book of the Law of Moses:
(TA:) and the Gospel: and the Kur-án: (K:)
because each of these comprises what is termed
الحِكْمَةُ المَنْطُوقُ بِهَا, i. e. the secrets of the sciences
of the law and of the course of conduct; and
الحِكْمَةُ المَسْكُوتُ عَنْهَا, i. e. the secrets of the science
of the Divine Essence. (TA.)
حَكَمَةٌ [A kind of curb for a horse;] a certain
appertenance of a beast; so called because it
renders him manageable, or submissive, to the
rider, and prevents him from being refractory
and the like; (Msb;) or because it prevents
him from vehement running: (TA:) it is the
appertenance of the لِجَام [or bridle] that surrounds the حَنَك [or part beneath the chin and
lower jaw]: the Arabs used to make it of untanned
thong or of hemp; because what they aimed at
was courage, not finery: (S:) or the appertenance
of the لجام that surrounds the حَنَكَانِ [which
word app. here means the two jaws] of the horse,
and in which are [attached] the عِذَارَانِ [or two
side-pieces of the headstall, that lie against the
two cheeks]: (K:) or a ring which surrounds
the مَرْسِن [or part of the nose which is the place
of the halter] and the حَنَك [or part beneath the
chin and lower jaw], of silver or iron or thong:
(IDrd in his Book on the Saddle and Bridle:)
or a ring which is upon (فى) the mouth of the
horse: (ISh, TA:) pl. حَكَمَاتٌ (S, TA) and [coll.
gen. n.] ↓ حَكَمٌ. (TA.) Zuheyr says, describing
horses,
حَكَمَاتِ القِدِّ وَ الأَبَقَا ↓ قَدْ أُحْكِمَتْ
meaning قَدْ أُحْكِمَتْ بِحَكَمَاتِ القِدِّ وَ بِحَكَمَاتِ الأَبَقِ
[That had been curbed with curbs of untanned
thong, and with curbs of hemp]: (S, TA:) or,
accord. to Abu-l-Hasan, [the meaning is that had
been furnished with curbs &c.; for he says that]
احكمت is here made trans. because it implies
the signification of قُلِّدَتْ: (TA:) some relate
the hemistich thus:
حَكَمَاتِ القِدِّ وَ الأَبَقَا ↓ مَحْكُومَةً
[furnished with curbs of untanned thong, and
hemp]. (S, TA.) ―
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  The chin of a sheep (S,
K) or goat. (S.) ―
-b3-  And, of a man, (tropical:)  The fore
part of the face: (K, TA:) or, as some say, the
lower part of the face: a metaphorical term from
the حَكَمَة of the لِجَام: (TA:) or [in some copies
of the K “ and ”] (tropical:)  his head: [accord. to the
CK, or the fore part of the head of a man:]
and (tropical:)  his state, or condition: and (tropical:)  rank, and
station. (K, TA.) You say, رَفَعَ اللّٰهُ حَكَمَتَهُ (tropical:)  God
exalted, or may God exalt, his head, or his state,
or condition, and his rank, and station: because
the stooping of the head is a characteristic of the
low, or abject. (TA.) And لَهُ عِنْدَنَا حَكَمَةٌ (tropical:)  He
has rank in our estimation. (TA.) And فُلَانٌ
عَالِى الحَكَمَةِ (tropical:)  [Such a one is elevated in respect
of rank, or station.] (TA.)
-A2-  [See also حَاكِمٌ,
of which it is a pl.]
حَكِيمٌ Possessing knowledge or science; [in its
most usual sense,] possessing حِكْمَة [as meaning
wisdom]; (S, TA; [see also أَحْكَمُ الحَاكِمِينَ;])
[wise; a sage: and in the modern language,
a philosopher: and particularly a physician:]
one who performs, or executes, affairs firmly,
solidly, soundly, thoroughly, skilfully, judiciously,
or well; (S, IAth;) so that it is, in this sense,
of the measure فَعِيلٌ in the sense of the measure
مُفْعِلٌ: (IAth, TA:) one who executes well, and
firmly, solidly, &c., the niceties of arts: (TA:)
[pl. حُكَمَآءُ.] الحَكِيمُ [as meaning The All-wise]
is one of the names of God. (TA.) ―
-b2-  الذِّكْرُ
الحَكِيمُ, applied to the Kur-án, means [The admonition] that decides judicially in your favour
and against you: or that is rendered free from
defect or imperfection; in which is no incongruity, nor any unsoundness. (TA.)
حُكُومَةٌ an inf. n. of حَكَمَ [q. v.]: (K:) [and
used as a simple subst.; pl. حُكُومَاتٌ:] see حُكْمٌ,
in two places. ―
-b2-  Also [Judicial authority; authority to judge, give judgment, pass sentence, or
decide judicially, فِى أَمْرٍ respecting an affair,
or a case;] a subst. from اِحْتَكَمَ and تَحَكَّمَ; and
so ↓ أُحْكُومَةٌ. (K, TA.)
حَاكِمٌ One who judges, gives judgment, passes
sentence, or decides judicially; a judge; an
arbiter, arbitrator, or umpire; (S * Msb, K,
TA;) between people: (Msb, TA:) [one who
exercises judicial authority, jurisdiction, rule,
dominion, or government; a ruler, or governor:]
and ↓ حَكَمٌ signifies the same: (S, Mgh, Msb, K:)
the حَاكِم between people is so called because he
restrains from wrongdoing: (As, TA:) the pl.
is حُكَّامٌ (Msb, K) and حَكَمَةٌ, meaning judges,
[&c.,] (TA,) and حَاكِمُونَ is allowable. (Msb.)
It is said in a prov., ↓ فِى بَيْتِهِ يُؤْتَى الحَكَمُ [In
his house the judge is to be come to]. (S. [See
Freytag's Arab. Prov. ii. 204.]) الحَاكِمُ [as
meaning The Supreme Judge] is one of the names
of God. (TA.) See also the next paragraph.
-A2-
[The pl.] حَكَمَةٌ also signifies Mockers, scoffers,
or deriders. (TA. [The ح in this case seems to
be a substitute for ه: see art. هكم.])
↓ أَحْكَمُ الحَاكِمِينَ [The most qualified to judge
of those who judge: or] the most knowing and
most just [of them]: (Bd and Jel in xi. 47,
where it is applied to God:) or it may mean
the wisest of those who possess attributes of
wisdom; supposing حَاكِمٌ to be [a possessive
epithet] from الحِكْمَةُ, like دَارِعٌ from الدِّرْعُ. (Bd.)
أُحْكُومَةٌ: see حُكُومَةٌ.
مُحْكَمٌ [pass. part. n. of أَحْكَمَهُ;] applied to a
building [&c.,] Made, or rendered, firm, stable,
strong, solid, compact, &c.; held to be secure
from falling to pieces. (KT.) ―
-b2-  And hence, A
passage, or portion, of the Kur-án of which the
meaning is secured (أُحْكِمَ) from change, and
alteration, and peculiarization, and interpretation not according to the obvious import, and
abrogation. (KT.) And سُورَةٌ مُحْكَمَةٌ A chapter
of the Kur-án not abrogated. (K.) And الآيَاتُ
المُحْكَمَاتُ, [see Kur iii. 5, where it is opposed
to آيَاتٌ مُتَشَابِهَاتٌ,] The portion commencing with
قُلْ تَعَالَوْا أَتْلُ مَا حَرَّمَ رَبُّكُمْ [Kur vi. 152], to the
end of the chapter: or the verses that are rendered free from defect or imperfection, so that
the hearer thereof does not need to interpret them
otherwise than according to their obvious import;
such as the stories of the prophets; (K;) or
so that they are preserved from being susceptible
of several meanings. (Bd in iii. 5.) And المُحْكَمُ
The portion of the Kur-án called المُفَصَّلُ [q. v.];
because nought thereof has been abrogated: or,
as some say, what is unequivocal, or unambiguous; because its perspicuity is made free
from defect, or imperfection, and it requires
nothing else [to explain it]. (TA.)
[
مَحْكَمَةٌ A place of judging; a tribunal; a

مُحَكَّمٌ فِى نَفْسِهِ [One who is made to judge
respecting himself: and particularly] one who
is given his choice between denial of God and
slaughter, and chooses slaughter. (Mgh.) In a
trad., in which it is said, إِنَّ الجَنَّةَ لِلْمُحَكَّمِينَ,
[Verily Paradise is for the مُحَكَّمُون], (S,)
لِلْمُحَكَّمِينَ, (S, K,) or, as some read, ↓ لِلْمُحَكَّمِينَ,
(K,) denotes a people of those who are called
أَصْحَابُ الأُخْدُودِ, who were given their choice
between slaughter and the denial of God, and
chose the remaining constant to El-Islám, with
slaughter: (S, K:) or المحكّمون means those
who fall into the hand of the enemy, and are
given their choice between [the profession of]
belief in a plurality of Gods, and slaughter, and
choose slaughter. (IAth, TA.) ―
-b2-  المُحَكَّمُ occurring in a poem of Tarafeh, (S,) or this is a
mistake, and the right reading is ↓ المُحَكِّمُ, (K,)
An old man, tried, or proved, and strengthened
by experience in affairs; (S, K;) to whom
حِكْمَة [or wisdom, &c.,] is attributed: (S:) or
both are correct, like مُجَرَّبٌ and مُجَرِّبٌ, as
several authors have allowed; the former meaning one whom events have controlled (حَكَّمَتْهُ
الحَوَادِثُ), and tried, or proved;  and the latter,
one who has controlled (حَكَّمَ), and experienced,
events. (MF.)
مُحَكِّمٌ, and its pl. مُحَكِّمُونَ: see مُحَكَّمٌ. ―
-b2-
المُحَكِّمَةُ is an appellation applied to the [schismatics called the] خَوَارِج because they disallowed
the judgment of the ↓ حَكَمَانِ [or two judges],
(S,) namely, Aboo-Moosà El-Ash'aree and 'Amr
Ibn-El-' Ás, (K, TA,) and said that judgment
الحُكْمُ) belongs not to any but God. (S.)
فَرَسٌ مَحْكُومَةٌ A horse [furnished with a
حَكَمَة; or] having a حَكَمَة upon his head. (Az,
TA.) See حَكَمَةٌ.
مُتَحَكِّمٌ A judge who judges without evidence:
and one who judges in the way of asking respecting a thing with the desire of bringing perplexity,
or doubt, and difficulty, upon the person asked.
(Har p. 97.)
