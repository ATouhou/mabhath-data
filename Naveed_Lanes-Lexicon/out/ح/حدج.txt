حدج1
حَدَجَهُ, (S, A, K, *) aor.
حَدِجَ, inf. n. حَدْجٌ (S,
K) and حِدَاجٌ, (TA,) He bound the حِدْج upon
him, i. e., upon the camel; (S, A, K;) as also
↓ احدجهُ: (K:) or he bound upon him the حِدَاجَة,
i. e., the [saddle called] قَتَب and its apparatus;
(Az, TA;) which apparatus consists of the بِدَادَانِ
with the two girths called the بِطَان and the حَقَب,
without which a camel is not [said to be] مَحْدُوج.
(Sh, TA.) [See حِدْجٌ.] Accord. to J, حَدَجَ
also signifies He bound loads, or burdens, and
divided them into camel-loads: (TA:) but this
is a meaning that was unknown to the Arabs.
(Az, TA.) J cites as an ex. the words of ElAashà,
أَلِلْبَيْنِ تُحْدَجُ أَحْمَالُهَا
[Is it for separation that her loads are bound
&c.?]: but he adds that, accord. to one reading,
the poet said أَجْمَالُهَا: and this [SM says] is the
right reading. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence, حَدَجَ is used
to signify (tropical:)  He betook himself to warring for the
sake of the religion.] 'Omar is related to have
said, حِجَّةٌ هٰهُنَا ثُمَّ احْدِجْ هٰهُنَا حَتَّى تَفْنَى, meaning Perform one pilgrimage, then (tropical:)  betake thyself
to warring for the sake of the religion until thou
become old and weak, or die; احدج literally signifying bind the حِدَاجَة upon the camel. (Az,
TA.) ―
-b3-  [Hence also,] حَدَجَهُ, (TA,) inf. n. حَدْجٌ,
(K,) (tropical:)  He imposed upon him in a sale. (K, TA.)
You say, حَدَجْتُهُ بِبَيْعٍ سَوْءٍ (A, TA) (tropical:)  I imposed
upon him with a bad sale, and بِمَتَاعٍ سَوْءٍ with bad
merchandise. (TA.) The person imposed upon
is likened to a camel upon which a حِدَاجَة is
bound. (Az, TA.) ―
-b4-  And حَدَجْتُهُ بِمَهْرٍ ثَقيلٍ (tropical:)  I
imposed upon him a heavy dowry, by deceit and
fraud. (A, TA.)
-A2-  Also, aor.
حَدِجَ, inf. n. حَدْجٌ,
He cast حَدَج [or unripe and hard colocynths,
or small colocynths, or small and green colocynths

-b2-  Hence, (A,
TA,) حَدَجَهُ بِسَهْمٍ, (S, A,) inf. n. حَدْجٌ, (K,)

TA, * TK.) And حَدَجَهُ بِذَنْبِ غَيْرِهِ (S, A) (tropical:)  He

حُدُوجٌ; and ↓ حدّجهُ, inf. n. تَحْدِيجٌ; (TA;)
(tropical:)  He cast his eyes at him; (S, TA;) as also
حَدَجَ إِلَيْهِ بَصَرَهُ: or he looked intently, and sharply,
at him: or he looked at him with a look which
he [the latter] suspected and disliked: (TA:)
but حَدْجٌ in looking may be unattended by alarm,
or fear: (Az, TA:) ↓ تَحْدِيجٌ is like تَحْدِيقٌ,
(S,) syn. therewith: (K:) and also signifies the
looking intently, after alarm, or fear. (TA.) ―

حِدْجٌ A certain thing upon which the women
of the Arabs of the desert ride; not a رَحْل nor
a هَوْدَج: (Lth, TA:) a certain vehicle, or thing
to ride upon, for women, (Az, S, A, K,) like the
مِحَفَّة, (Az, S, K,) and like the هَوْدَج; (Az, TA;)
as also ↓ حِدَاجَةٌ: (S, A, K:) pl. of the former
حُدُوجٌ and أَحْدَاجٌ (S, A, K) and حُدُجٌ; (AAF,
TA;) and pl. of the latter حَدَائِجُ: (Yaakoob, S,
A:) Az, however, says that ISk makes no difference between the حِدْج and the ↓ حِدَاجَة, though
there is a difference between them accord. to
the Arabs, as will be seen from what follows:
Sh says that حِدْجٌ is a name given to a هُوْدَج
bound upon a قَتَب [or small kind of camel's
saddle] when it is bound upon the camel at once
with all its apparatus: he also says that ↓ حِدَاجَةٌ
is a name given to the apparatus composed of
the أَبِدَّة], pl. of بِدَادٌ, q. v.,] which are also called
مَخَالِى القَتَبِ, [and which are appertenances of
the قتب,] when they are filled, and drawn together, and bound, and tied to the قتب: [and
he shows, in his explanation of the verb حَدَجَ,
that this apparatus comprises the قَتَب and بِدَادَانِ
with the two girths called the بِطَان and the حَقَب:
this is what is meant in the K by the saying that
↓ الحِدَاجَةُ also signifies الأَدَاةُ:] Aboo-Sá'id ElKilábee says that ↓ حداجة signifies the apparatus
(اداة) of the قتب: and Az says that it signifies
the قتب with its apparatus. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also A
load, or burden. (S, K.) ―
-b3-  And [its pl.] حُدُوجٌ,
Camels with their رِحَال [or saddles]. (TA.)
حَدَجٌ [a coll. gen. n.] The colocynth, or colocynths, when unripe and hard: (TA:) or when

K,) while small and green, before becoming yellow,
