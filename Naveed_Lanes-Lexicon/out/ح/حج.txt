R. Q. 2
تَحَجْحَجَ: see what next precedes.
حَجُّ and ↓ حِجٌّ, the former an inf. n., and the
latter a simple subst., (S, Msb, K,) or the latter
also is an inf. n., (Sb, L,) [both used as substs.,]
The pilgrimage to Mekkeh, (S, K,) or to the
Kaabeh, (Msb,) to perform the religious rites
and ceremonies prescribed to be observed on that
occasion: (S, Msb, K:) Ks makes no difference
between these two words: some say that the
former is employed to signify the religious rites
and ceremonies of the pilgrimage because they
follow the repairing to Mekkeh, or because
they are completed by shaving [the head], or
because people continue long going to and fro
to perform them: accord. to Az, it signifies the
performance of the religious rites and ceremonies
of the pilgrimage of one year; and some
say ↓ حِجٌّ and ↓ حِجَّةٌ: (TA:) or this last signifies a single pilgrimage, for the performance
of its appointed religious rites and ceremonies;
deviating from rule; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;) for by
rule it should be ↓ حَجَّةٌ, (S, Mgh, K,) which, Th
says, has not been heard from the Arabs: (Mgh,
Msb:) Ks says that ↓ حَجَجْتُ حِجَّةً and رَأَيْتُ
رُؤْيَةً are the only deviations from the model of
فَعَلْتُ فَعْلَةً in all the language of the Arabs: but
El-Athram and others are related to have said,
We have not heard from the Arabs حَجَجْتُ حِجَّةً
nor رَأَيْتُ رِئْيَةً; they saying only ↓ حَجَجْتُ حَجَّةً:
(L, TA:) whence it appears that ↓ حَجَّةٌ and
↓ حِجَّةٌ were both used: (TA:) the pl. of the
latter is حِجَجٌ: (Mgh, Msb:) so in the saying,
نَذَرَ خَمْسَ حِجَجٍ [He made a vow to perform
five pilgrimages]. (Mgh.) Hence, ↓ ذُو الحِجَّةِ
(S, Mgh, Msb) and ↓ ذو الحَجَّةِ, (Msb, TA,)
which latter is said by Kz and 'Iyád and Ibn-
Kurkool to be the more common, (TA,) [or,
accord. to Fei, the contr. is the case, for he says,]
some pronounce it in the latter manner, (Msb,)
[The last month of the Arabian calendar;] the
month of the pilgrimage; (S, Mgh, Msb;) so
called because the pilgrimage to Mekkeh, and
the religious rites and ceremonies thereof, are
performed in it: (TA:) pl. ذَوَاتُ الحجّهِ: (S,
Msb:) they did not say ذَوُو الحَجّةِ agreeably
with the singular. (S.) [Hence also,] ↓ وَحَجَّةِ
اللّٰهِ لَا أَفْعَلُ [By the pilgrimage which is the
ordinance of God, I will not do this or that
thing]: a form of oath used by the Arabs. (S,
K.) What is commonly termed الحَجُّ is sometimes termed الحَجُّ الأَكْبَرُ [The greater pilgrimage]: العُمْرَةُ [q. v.] being termed الحَجَّ
الأَصْغَرُ [the minor pilgrimage]. (Kull p. 168.)
―
-b2-  See also حَاجٌّ.
حِجُّ: see حَجُّ, in two places: ―
-b2-  and see also
حَاجٌّ.
حَجَّةٌ: see حَجٌّ, in five places.
-A2-  Also, (IAar,
K,) and ↓ حِجَّةٌ, (S, K,) the former of which is
the word commonly known, (IAar in a marginal
note in a copy of the S,) and ↓ حَاجَّةٌ, which is a
subst. like كَاهِلٌ and غَارِبٌ, (L,) The lobe of the
ear. (S, L, K.) ―
-b2-  And the first, The bore, or
perforation, of the lobe of the ear. (AA, TA.)
―
-b3-  And A bead, or a pearl, that is hung in the
ear; (K;) sometimes called ↓ حَاجَّةٌ. (IDrd,
TA.)
حُجَّةٌ A mode [of argument or the like] by
which one overcomes in a litigation, dispute, or
altercation; so called because recourse is had to
it (لِأَنَّهَا تُحَجُّ, i. e. تُقْصَدُ): (T, TA:) that by
which one rebuts, or refels, an adversary in a
litigation, dispute, or altercation: an argument;
a plea; an allegation: [it may be true or false:
see Kur xlii. 15, and xlv. 24:] (TA:) a proof;
an evidence; a testimony: (S, Msb, K:) [a title;
a voucher: often thus used in the present day:]
also applied to a person; like ثَبَتٌ; (A and Mgh
and TA in art. ثبت;) [as in the saying, مَنْ حِفِظَ
حُجَّةٌ عَلَى مَنْ لَمْ يَحْفَظْ He who preserves in his
mind a word, or an authority, &c., is an evidence
against him who does not; occurring often in the
larger lexicons, expressing the superior authority
of hearsay, or usage, over analogy &c.; and in
the saying,] أَنْتَ حُجَّةٌ عَلَى نَفْسِكَ [Thou art an
evidence against thyself]; a phrase mentioned by
Akh: (S in art. بصر:) [also, an excuse:] pl.
حُجَجٌ (A, Msb) and حِجَاجٌ. (TA.)
حِجَّةٌ: see حَجٌّ, in four places. ―
-b2-  Also A
year: (S, Msb, K:) pl. حِجَجٌ. (S, A, Msb.)
You say, أَقَمْتُ عِنْدَهُ حِجَّةً [I stayed at his abode
a year], and ثَلَاثَ حِجَجٍ كَوَامِلَ [three complete
years]. (A.)
-A2-  See also حَجَّةٌ.
حُجُجٌ: see حَجِيجٌ, in two places: ―
-b2-  and see
also حَجَاجٌ.
حَجَاجٌ and ↓ حِجَاجٌ The surrounding bone of
the eye, (Msb, TA,) upon [the upper part of]
which grows the eyebrow; (TA;) the bone that
surrounds the cavity of the eye, upon [the upper
part of] which grows the hair of the eyebrow:
(ISk, TA:) it is said in a trad. that a female
hyena and her young ones were within the
حجاج of the eye of an Amalekite: (TA:) or
the [supra-orbital] bone upon which grows the hair
of the eyebrow; (S, K;) the bone that projects
over the cavity of the eye: (IAmb, Msb:) or the
upper bone, beneath the eyebrow: (TA:) of the
mase. gender: (Msb:) pl. [of pauc.] أَحِجَّةٌ (S,
Msb) and [of mult.] ↓ حُجُجٌ, deviating from a
general rule, accord. to which a sing. of the
measure to which this belongs does not assume
this form of pl. because the reduplication is disapproved: also, by poetic license, حَوَاجِجُ, contr.
to rule, for حَوَاجُّ. (TA.) The expression فِى
حَجَا حَاجِبٍ ضَمْرٍ is used by poetic license for
فى حَجَاجِ حاجب ضمر. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,]
both words also signify (tropical:)  The upper limb of the
disk (i. q. حَاجِب) of the sun, appearing when it
begins to rise. (A, K, TA: but in the A, only
the latter form of the word is given.) ―
-b3-  Also,
[hence,] both words, (tropical:)  A side. (A, * K.) You
say, مَرُّوا بِحِجَاجَىِ الجَبَلِ (tropical:)  They passed by the
two sides of the mountain. (A.)
حِجَاجٌ: see the paragraph next preceding.
حَجِيجٌ A man upon whom the operation termed
حَجٌّ (the probing of a fracture of the head, &c.,)
has been performed; (S, L;) as also ↓ مَحْجُوجٌ.
(L.) And A fracture of the head that has been
medically treated, or cured: ―
-b2-  and also A certain
mode of medical treatment, or curing, of such a
fracture. (As, TA.) ―
-b3-  ↓ حُجُجٌ (pl. of حَجِيجٌ,
TA) signifies Probed wounds. (K.) ―
-b4-  And
↓ this same pl., Roads much furrowed [by the
feet of beasts or men] (مُحَفَّرَةٌ): (L, K:) but it is
uncertain whether its sing., if it have any, be
حَجِيجٌ or حِجَاجٌ. (MF.)
-A2-  Also i. q. ↓ مُحَاجٌّ
as act. part. n. of حَاجَّ: so in the phrase, أَنَا
حَجِيجُهُ I am he who will overcome him by
arguments, or proofs, or the like: occurring in a
trad. relating to Ed-Dejjál. (TA.)
-A3-  See also
حَاجٌّ.
حَجَّاجٌ A frequent performer of the pilgrimage
to Mekkeh, and of the religious rites and ceremonies ordained for that occasion: the ا in this
word, as in other epithets of the same measure,
does not [regularly] admit of imáleh; but when
it is used as a proper name, it admits this, agreeably with rule: some pronounce its ا with imáleh
even when it is in the nom. or accus. case,
contr. to rule. (TA.)
حَاجٌّ act. part. n. of 1; Repairing, or betaking
himself, to [a person or place]. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  And
hence, (S, Msb,) A man repairing to Mekkeh,
(S, K,) or to the Kaabeh, (Msb,) to perform the
religious rites and ceremonies of the pilgrimage;
(S, Msb, K;) or for the purpose of the عُمْرَة:
(Msb: [but see 1:]) [a pilgrim of Mekkeh; or
one who has performed the pilgrimage of Mekkeh:
see what follows:] as also ↓ حَاجِجٌ, (S, K,)
the original form, sometimes used by poetic
license: (S:) pl. حُجَّاجٌ and ↓ حَجِيجٌ (S, A,
Msb, K) and حُجٌّ; (S, K;) or rather the second
of these is a quasi-pl. n., a kind of noun which,
as well as the coll. gen. n., is often called by the
lexicographers a pl., though not so called by the
grammarians: (MF:) حَاجٌّ is also used as a pl.,
syn. with حُجَّاجٌ, like as سَامِرٌ is with سُمَّارٌ:
(Mgh:) it may be considered as a gen. n., and is
sometimes a quasi-pl. n., like جَامِلٌ and بَاقِرٌ;
(TA;) as is also ↓ حِجٌّ; signifying a company of
pilgrims of Mekkeh; or pilgrims, collectively;
(ISk, L;) and likewise ↓ حَجٌّ. (So in a marginal
note in a copy of the S.) The fem. is ↓ حَاجَّةٌ:
pl. حَوَاجُّ: (S, K:) you say حَوَاجُّ بَيْتِ اللّٰهِ when
they have performed the pilgrimage; but when
they have not yet performed it, [being in the act
of performing it,] you say حَوَاجُّ بَيْتَ اللّٰهِ, in
which latter case you would say حَوَاجٌّ were not
this word imperfectly decl.; [and in like manner,
حَاجُّ بَيْتِ اللّٰهِ, and حَاجٌّ بَيْتَ اللّٰهِ;] like as you
say ضَارِبُ زَيْدٍ أَمْسِ, and ضَارِبٌ زَيْدًا غَدًا. (S.)
[↓ حَاجِّىٌّ, as a n. un. of حَاجٌّ, considering the latter
as a coll. gen. n., like رُومٌ, of which the n. un. is
رُومِىٌّ is commonly used by the Turks and Persians as signifying a pilgrim of Mekkeh: but I
have not found it so used in any classical Arabic
work.] You say, أَقْبَلَ الحَاجُّ وَالدَّاجُّ The company
of pilgrims to Mekkeh, and of men travelling for
mercantile purposes, came. (TA. [See also art.
دج.]) And وَلَا دَاجَّةً ↓ لَمْ يَتْرُكْ He left not
a company of pilgrims to Mekkeh (جَمَاعَةً حَاجَّةً),
nor a company of their followers, or dependents.
(TA from a trad. [See also arts. دج and دوج.])
-A2-  Also Overcoming in [or by] an argument, or
a plea, or the like. (Mgh.)

middle of a road; (M, voce جَرَجَةٌ;) the beaten
track, or part of a road along which one travels;
(T, TA;) the main part, and middle, of a road;
syn. جَادَّةٌ: (S, Msb:) pl. مَحَاجُّ. (A, TA.) ―

the affair, or case, [uniform, or] one uniform
thing. (Fr, TA in art. بأج.)
