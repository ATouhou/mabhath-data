رُجْعَى; (TA;) and the simple subst. [also] is

you say also, حَمَّمَ رَأْسُهُ His head became black
after shaving: (S, Mgh, TA:) [i. e.] the hair of
his head grew [again] after it had been shaven.
(K.) And hence, حمّم بِالمَآءِ, said of the hair,
It was rendered black by the water: because the
hair, when shaggy, or dishevelled, in consequence
of its being seldom dressed or anointed, becomes
dusty; and when it is washed with water, its
blackness appears. (TA.) And حمّم الغُلَامُ The
boy's, or young man's, beard appeared. (K.)

should be, as in the [S and] M, متّعها بِشَىْءٍ بَعْدَ

meaning أَعْطَى: so in the phrase, حَمَّمَهَاخَادِمًا
سَوْدَآءَ He gave her, after divorce, a black female
slave: or this may be for حَمَّمَهَابِهَا. (TA.)
[Hence,] ثِيَابُ التَّحِمَّة The clothing with which

حُمَّ,] aor.
حَمِ3َ, inf. n. حَمٌّ: (Msb:) it was, or
became, present: (K:) its time drew near, or
came; as also اجمّ: so says Ks; and thus this
last verb is explained by As; but he knew not
احمّ in this sense. (S, TA.) You say, أَحَمَّتِ
الحَاجَةُ and اجمّت The object of want became
near; (ISk, TA;) and both are mentioned by
Fr. (S.) And احمّ قُدُومُهُمْ and اجمّ Their
coming drew near. (Fr, TA.) The Kilábeeyeh
says, احمّ رَحِيلُنَا فَنَحْنُ سَائِرُونَ غَدًا [Our departure has drawn near, and we are going tomorrow]: and اجمّ رحيلنا فنحن سائرون اليَوْمَ
[Our departure is determined upon, and we are
going to-day]; meaning we have determined
upon our going to-day. (TA.)

primary signification: (S:) then applied, (S,
Msb,) by reason of frequency of usage, (Msb,)
to mean he washed himself with any water. (S,
Msb. [See also 4.]) ―

stops bleeding from the nose: (K:) the n. un. is
with ة; (S, Msb;) which is applied to the male

i. e. I saw a male [pigeon] upon a female [pigeon]:

حَمَامٌ should not be applied to the [single] male:
(TA:) in a verse of Homeyd Ibn-Thowr, cited
voce حُرٌّ, by the n. un. is meant a قُمْرِيَّة: the pl.
of حمامة is حَمَامٌ, (S,) [or rather this is the

وَذَكَّرَنِى الصِّبَا بَعْدَ التَّنَائِى
حَمَامَةُ أَيْكَةٍ تَدْعُو حَمَامَا
[And a female pigeon of a thicket, calling a male
pigeon, reminded me of youth, after estrangement]:
a poet also says,
حَمَامَا قَقْرَةٍ وَقَعَا فَطَارَا
[Two pigeons of a desert tract alighted and flew
away]: and El-Umawee cites, as an ex. of حَمَام
applied to the domestic [pigeons],
قَوَاطِنًا مَكَّةَ مِنْ وُرْقِ الحَمَى
[Inhabiting Mekkeh, of the pigeons of a white
colour inclining to black]; by الحمى [or rather
it should be written الحَمَا] meaning الحَمَام.
(S.)
حُمَامٌ The fever (حُمَّى) of camels; (S;) as also
↓ حُمَّآءُ: (TA:) or of all beasts, (K, TA,) including camels: (TA:) accord. to ISh, when camels
eat date-stones, [which are often given to them as
food,] they are [sometimes] affected with حُمَام
and قُمَاح; the former of which is a heat affecting
the skin, until the body is smeared with mud, or clay,
in consequence of which they forsake the abundant

signifying (tropical:)  Such as are held in high estimation,
precious, or excellent, or the choice, or best, (S,
K, TA,) of cattle or other property, (S,) or of
camels: (K:) and accord. to Kr, the sing. is used
as a pl. in this sense: (ISd, TA:) ↓ حَمَامَةٌ, likewise, signifies the choice, or best, of cattle or other
property; and so ↓ حَامَّةٌ, of camels: (K:) or you
say إِبِلٌ حَامَّةٌ, meaning excellent, or choice, camels. (S.)
حُمَيْمَةٌ; accord. to the K, حُمَيْمَاتٌ, but this is
the pl.; (TA;) A live coal; syn. جَمْرَةٌ: (K,
TA:) or redness; syn. حُمْرَةٌ: (CK, and so in a
MS. copy of the K:) [in Freytag's Lex., the pl.
is explained as meaning redness of the skin; and
so ↓ حُمَامَى.]
حُمَامَى: see what next precedes.
حَمَامِىٌّ One who flies pigeons (حَمَام), and sends
them [as carriers of letters] to various towns or
countries. (TA.)
حُمّى, (S, K, &c.,) a subst. from حُمّ, (Lh, L,
K,) imperfectly decl., because of the fem. alif
[which terminates it], (Msb,) A fever; a disease
by which the body becomes hot: from الحَمِيمُ:
said to be so called because of the excessive heat;
whence the trad., الحُمَّى مِنْ فَيْحِ جَهَنَّمَ [Fever
is from the exhalation of Hell]: or because of the
sweat that occurs in it: or because it is of the
signs of الحِمَام [i. e. the decreed, or predestined,
case of death]; for they say, الحُمَّى رَائِدُ المَوْتِ
[Fever is the messenger that precedes death], or
بَرِيدُ المَوْتِ [the messenger of death], or بَابُ المَوْتِ
[the gate of death]: (TA:) and ↓ حُمَّةٌ signifies
the same: (K, TA:) pl. of the former حُمَّيَاتٌ.
(Msb.)
حُمَّآءُ: see حُمَامٌ.
حَمَّامٌ [A hot bath;] a certain structure, (S,)
well known; (Msb;) so called because it occasions sweating, or because of the hot water that
is in it; accord. to ISd, derived from الحَمِيمُ;
(TA;) i. q. دَيْمَاسٌ: (K:) of the masc. gender,
(Mgh, K,) and fem. also, (Mgh,) generally the
latter; (Msb;) but some say that it is a mistake
to make it fem., (MF, TA,) though IB cites a
verse in which a fem. pronoun is asserted to refer
to a حمّام: (TA:) pl. حَمَّامَاتٌ; (S, Mgh, K;)
accord. to Sb, [not because the sing. is fem., but]
because, though masc., it has no broken pl. (TA.)
See also حَمِيمٌ.
حَمَّامِىٌّ The owner [or keeper] of a حَمَّام [or
hot bath]. (Mgh.)
حُمْحُمٌ: see أَحَمُّ.

حَامَّةٌ The خَاصَّة [or particular, or special,
friends, or familiars], (S, K,) consisting of the
family and children (K) and relations, (TA,) of
a man. (K.) You say, كَيْفَ الحَامَّةُ وَالعَامَّةُ [How
are the particular, or special, friends, &c., and
the common people?]. (S.) And هٰؤُلَآءِ حَامَّةُ الرَّجُلِ
These are the relations of the man. (Lth, S.)
[See حُمَّةٌ, and أَحمُّ.] ―
-b2-  See also حَمِيمَةٌ. ―
-b3-  Also
i. q. عَامَّةٌ. (K.) [It would seem that this signification might have been assigned to it in consequence of a misunderstanding of the words in the
S, وَالحَامَّةُ الخَاصَّةُ يُقَالُ كَيْفَ الحَامَّةُ وَالعَامَّةُ: but
accord. to the TK, one says, جَاؤُوا حَامَّةً, meaning
عَامَّةً, i. e. They came generally, or universally.]
آلُ حَامِيمَ and ذَوَاتُ حَامِيمَ, (K,) or ↓ آلُ حٰم
and ذَوَاتُ حٰم, (S,) آل being prefixed in this case
in like manner as in آلُ فُلَانٍ, (Fr, S,) Certain
chapters of the Kur-án (S, K) commencing with
حاميم [or حٰم], (K,) [namely, the fortieth and
six following chapters,] called by Ibn-Mes'ood
دِيبَاجُ القُرْآنِ: (S:) one should not say حَوَامِيم:
(K:) this is vulgar: (S:) but it occurs in poetry.
(S, K.) ―
-b2-  Also, (K,) accord. to I'Ab, ↓ حٰم is
One of the names of God; (Mgh;) or it is the
most great name of God; (K;) occurring in a
trad., in which it is said, إِنْ بُيِّتُّمْ فَقُولُوا حٰم لَا
يَنْصَرُونَ, meaning If ye be attacked by night,
say ye حٰم; and when ye say this, they shall not
be made victorious: (Mgh:) or the meaning is,
[say ye] O God, they shall not be made victorious;
not being an imprecation; for were it so, it would
be لَا يُنْصَرُوا: (IAth, TA:) or it is an oath;
(Mgh, K;) and the meaning of the trad. is, [say
ye] By God, they shall not be made victorious:
but حٰم is not among the numbered names of
God: it has therefore been deemed preferable
to understand it as here meaning the seven chapters of the Kur-án commencing therewith: (Mgh:)
or it is an abbreviation of الرَّحْمٰنُ, wanting the
letters الرن to complete it: (Zj, K:) or, as some
say, it means [حُمَّ مَا هُوَ كَائِنٌ, i. e.] قُضِىَ مَاهُوَ
كَائِنٌ [What is taking place has been decreed].
(Az, TA.) It is imperfectly decl. because determinate and of the fem. gender; or because it is of
a foreign measure, like قَابِيلُ and هَابِيلُ, (Ksh,
Bd,) and determinate. (Ksh.)
أَحَمُّ Black; (S, K;) applied to anything; as
also ↓ يَحْمُومٌ, (K,) and ↓ حمِحِمٌ, (As, K,) or this
signifies intensely black, (S,) and ↓ حُمْحُمٌ, (K,) which
IB explains as a black hue of dye: (TA:) [the
fem. of the first is حَمَّآءُ: and the pl. حُمٌّ: and]
the pl. of ↓ the second is يَحَامِيمُ, and by poetic
license يَحَامِمُ. (Sb, TA.) You say, رَجُلٌ أَحَمُّ A
black man. (S.) And رَجُلٌ أَحَمُّ المُقْلَتَيْنِ A man
having black eyes. (TA.) And كُمَيْتٌ أَحَمُّ [A
blackish bay horse]: pl. كُمْتٌ حُمٌّ; which are
the strongest of horses in skin and hoofs. (S.)

Of a colour between دُهْمَةٌ and كُمْتَةٌ. (M, TA.
[See حُمَّةٌ.]) ―
-b5-  Accord. to some, (TA,) أَحَمُّ also
signifies White: thus having two contr. meanings. (K, TA.)

(S.)
مَحَمَّةٌ, applied to food [&c.], (TA,) Any cause
of fever; or a thing from the eating of which one
