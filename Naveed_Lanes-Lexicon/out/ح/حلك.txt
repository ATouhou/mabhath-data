إِحْلَوْلَكَ see above.
حُلْكٌ: see حُلَكَةٌ.
حَلَكٌ Blackness: (S:) or intense blackness; as
also ↓ حُلْكَةٌ; (K;) like the colour of the crow, or
raven: (TA:) [for] حَلَكُ الغُرَابِ signifies the
blackness of the crow, or raven; as in the saying,
أَسْوَدُ مِثْلُ حَلَكِ الغُرَابِ [black like the blackness of
the crow, or raven]: (S:) or it means its حَنَك
[q. v.] : (K:) or if you say مثل حَنَكِ الغراب, you
mean its beak; (S;) or the blackness of its feathers: (Er-Rághib, TA in art. حنك:) or they
said أَسْوَدُ مِنْ حَلَكِ الغُرَابِ [blacker than the حلك
of the crow, or raven]: or من حَنَكِ الغراب: an
Arab of the desert, being asked by Fr whether he
said the latter or the former, answered that he
never said the former: Umm-El-Heythem, being
asked by AHát the same, answered that she said
the former, and never the latter; (TA;) and she
explained the former as meaning its two jaws and
the part around them; adding that [the saying
that it means] its beak is nought: and IDrd is
related to have disallowed the saying من حنك
الغراب: (TA in art. حنك:) accord. to AZ,
الحَلَك means the colour; and الحَنَك, the beak:
some say that the ن in the latter is a substitute
for the ل in the former; but others deny this.
(TA.) In the saying of a poet,
الغُرَابِ ↓ مِدَادٌ مِثْلُ حَالِكَةِ
[Ink like the حالكة of the crow, or raven], cited
by Th, حالكة may be a dial. var. of حَلَك: or it
may mean its feathers; its خَافِيَة or its قَادِمَة or
other feathers. (TA.)
حُلْكَةٌ: see حَلَكٌ:
-A2-  and see also حُلَكَةٌ.
-A3-
Also i. q. حُكْلَةٌ: (K:) formed from the latter by
transposition: so in the saying, فِى لِسَانِهِ حُلْكَةٌ
[In his speech is a barbarousness, or a vitiousness,
or an impediment, &c.]. (TA.)
حُلَكَةٌ, (S, Msb,) or ↓ حُلْكَةٌ, (ISd, K,) and
↓ حَلْكَآءُ (S, Msb, K) and ↓ حُلْكَآءُ (K) and ↓ حَلَكَآءُ
and ↓ حُلَكَآءُ, (IDrd, K,) or ↓ حُلَكَى, (L,) and
↓ حُلُكَّى, (IDrd, K,) A species of the [kind of
lizard called] عَظَآء: (S, Msb, K: [in the CK, erroneously, غِطاء:]) or (S, K [but in the Msb
which is]) a small reptile, (S, Msb, K,) resembling
a fish, of a blue [or greyish] color, and glistening,
(Msb,) or smooth, and having a mixture of whiteness and redness, (TA in art. نقى,) that dives into
the sand, (S, Msb, K,) like as the aquatic bird
dives into the water; the Arabs call it بَنَاتُ النَّقَا,
because it dwells in the sand-hills; (Msb;) and
شَحْمَةُ النَّقَا; (TA in art. نقى;) and they liken
to it the fingers (بَنَان) of girls, because of their
softness, or suppleness: it is also called حُكَلَةٌ,
which is app. formed by transposition: (Msb:)
↓ حُلْكٌ [is the coll. gen. n., or quasi-pl. n. ; for it]
signifies شَحْمُ النَّقَا. (L in art. عوج.)
