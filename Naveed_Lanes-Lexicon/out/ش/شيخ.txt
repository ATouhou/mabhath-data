شيخ1
شَاخَ, (S, A, Msb, K,) aor. يَشِيخُ, (S, Msb,
K,) inf. n. شَيَخٌ, with fet-h to the ى, (S, K,) and
شُيُوخَةٌ (K) and شِيُوخَةٌ (TA) and شُيُوخِيَّةٌ (K) and
شِيُوخِيَّةٌ (Zbd, TA) and شَيْخُوخَةٌ [the most common form, respecting which see what follows,]
(S, A, Msb, K) and شَيْخُوخِيَّةٌ; (K;) and ↓ شيّخ,
inf. n. تَشْيِيخٌ; (S, A, K;) and ↓ تشيّخ; (K;) He
became a شَيْخ [i. e. an old, or elderly, man;
&c.]: (S, A, Msb, K:) in شَيْخُوخَةٌ, the ى is
originally movent [with fet-h], and afterwards
made quiescent, for there is not in the language
a word of the measure فَعْلُولٌ [except صَعْفُوقٌ, as
is said in the S in art. حيد]: as to the similar
words whose medial radical letter is و, as كَيْنُونَةٌ
and قَيْدُودَةٌ and دَيْمُومَةٌ and هَيْعُوعَةٌ, these are
originally كَيَّنُونَةٌ [for كَيْوَنُونَةٌ, of the measure
فَيْعَلُولَةٌ,] and the like, and are contracted; for
were it not so, they would be كَوْنُونَةٌ and the
like. (S, L.)

شيّخ: see the preceding paragraph.
-A2-  شيّخهُ,
(S, K,) inf. n. تَشْيِيخٌ, (TA,) He called him by
the appellation of شَيْخ, to pay him honour, or
respect. (S, K, TA.)
-A3-  And شيّخ عَلَيْهِ He attributed or imputed to him, or charged him with,
a vice, or fault; blamed, or reproached, him;
(K, TA;) cast a bad, an evil, a foul, or an excessively bad or evil or foul, imputation upon him.
(TA.) And شيّخ بِهِ [and so شيّخهُ accord. to an
explanation of شَيَّخْتُ الرجل, as on the authority
of AZ, in the TA, but this may be a mistranscription for شيّخت بِالرَّجُلِ,] He exposed his vices,
faults, or evil actions; disgraced him; or put
him to shame. (K, TA.)

تشيّخ: see 1. ―
-b2-  [It signifies also] He feigned,
or made a show of, old age. (KL.)
شَيْخٌ (S, A, Mgh, L, Msb, K, &c.) and ↓ شَيْخُونٌ,
(K,) but the latter is a strange word, mentioned
by some of the expositors of the Fs, as expressing
more than the former word, (MF,) [An old, or
elderly, man; an elder, as meaning a man whose
age gives him a claim to reverence or respect; a
senior;] one advanced in age, (Mgh,) such as is
beyond him who is termed كَهْلٌ, (Mgh, Msb,)
which means him whose شَبَاب [i. e. youthfulness,
or prime of manhood,] is ended: (Mgh:) one in
whom age has become apparent, (L, K,) and
hoariness: (L:) or a man from the age of fifty,
or fifty-one, to the end of his life, or to the age of
eighty: (L, K:) also expl. as meaning a man
advanced in age but having strength, or vigour,
to fight: and an old and weak, or a decrepit,
man, who is of no service: (Mgh:) [in the present
day, شَيْخٌ is used in the senses above mentioned;
and is also especially applied, as an appellation of
honour, to a doctor of religion and law; a head,
or chief, of a religious confraternity; a chief of a
tribe or the like, and of a village; and to a reputed saint:] fem. ↓ شَيْخَةٌ, (S, A, Msb, K,) an
old, or aged, woman; syn. عَجُوزٌ: (A:) [and
applied in the present day particularly to a learned
woman; an instructress; and the like:] the pl. [of
pauc.] of شَيْخٌ is أَشْيَاخٌ (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K) and
شِيخَةٌ (Kr, ISd, A, Mgh, Msb, K) and [of mult.]
شُيُوخٌ (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K) and شِيُوخٌ (K, with
kesr, to agree with the ى, TA) and شِيخَانٌ (S,
A, Msb, K) and شِيَخَةٌ (S, Mgh, K) and شَيَخَةٌ
(A [there said to be like عَبَدَةٌ]) and ↓ مَشْيَخَةٌ, (K,
and so in one of my copies of the S,) or this last
is a quasi-pl. n., (Mgh, Msb,) and [so are]
↓ مِشْيَخَةٌ and ↓ مَشْيُخَةٌ and ↓ مِشْيُخَةٌ (TA) and
↓ مَشِيخَةٌ (K, and so in one of my copies of the
S,) and ↓ مَشْيُوخَآءُ, (S, K,) the last like مَشْيُوحَآءُ
and مَعْلُوجَآءُ and مَسْلُومَآءُ and مَعْبُودَآءُ and مَعْيُورَآءُ,
which are said to be the only other instances of
this form, (TA,) [but to these should be added
مَحْمُورَآءُ and مَكْبُورَآءُ and مَتْيُوسَآءُ and perhaps
some other instances,] and ↓ مَشْيُخَآءُ, (K,) and
another pl. is ↓ مَشَايِخُ, (S, A, K,) or this last is
pl. of مَشْيَخَةٌ, (Mgh, Msb,) and is disallowed by
IDrd and Kz (TA) [though very commonly used
in the present day, especially as applied to doctors
of religion and law]; and the pl. of أَشْيَاخٌ is
أَشَايِيخُ, like أَنَايِيبُ pl. of أَنْيَابٌ: (Z, TA:) the
dim. of شَيْخٌ is ↓ شُيَيْخٌ (S, A, K) and ↓ شِيَيْخٌ,
(S, K,) with kesr to the ش: (S:) ↓ شُوَيْخٌ is not
allowable, (S, A,) or is rare. (K.) ―

The two Sheykhs, is a title peculiarly applied to
the first two Khaleefehs, Aboo-Bekr and 'Omar.]
―
-b3-  شَيْخٌ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  A woman's husband, (K,)
though young: and in like manner, a man's wife,
whether old or young, is called his عَجُوز. (Az,
TA in art. عجز.) ―
-b4-  [And (tropical:)  An ancestor. Accord. to a copy of the A that seems to have been
used by the author of the TA, one says, وَرِثَ مِنْ
مَشِيخَةِ الكَرَم and من أَشْيَاخِهِ, which is tropical,
meaning مِنْ آبَائِهِ: but the right reading is evidently ↓ من مَشِيخَتِهِ, and الكَرَمَ; and the meaning,
(tropical:)  He inherited, from his ancestors, generosity.] ―
-b5-
شَيْخُ النَّارِ means (tropical:)  Iblees: because he was created
of fire, or because his ultimate place will be the
fire of Hell. (Har p. 130.) ―

seven [or five] planets; (TK;) or the دَرَارِىْء [also
applied by some to the five planets, Mercury,
Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn]; accord. to
IAar, اشياخ النجوم, (TA in this art.,) or أَسْنَاخُ
النُّجُومِ as is related by Th, (TA in art. سنخ,)
means the stars that do not make their [temporary] abode in the Mansions of the Moon, which
[latter] are called نُجُومُ الأَخْذِ: ISd says, I think
that he means, by the نجوم, the fixed stars: Th
says that they are called only أَسْنَاخُ النُّجُومِ, i. e.
the أُصُول thereof, around which the [other] stars
revolve, and pursue their courses. (TA. [See
also سِنْخٌ, last sentence.])
-A2-  شَيْخٌ signifies also
A certain tree; (AZ, K, TA;) also called شَجَرَةُ
الشُّيُوخِ, the fruit of which is a جِرْو [q. v.] like
that of the خِرِّيع, which is the bastard saffron
(شَجَرَةُ العُصْفُرِ); it grows in the meadows, and
the قُرْيَان [or places where water runs to, or in,
or into, meadows, &c.]. (AZ, TA.)
