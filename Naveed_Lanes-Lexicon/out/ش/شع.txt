(Z, TA,) are disordered, or unsettled, (S, K,
TA,) so that it is not directed to a decided affair.
(Z, TA.) And طَارَ فُؤَادُهُ شَعَاعًا [His mind fled in
a disordered, or an unsettled, state, as though
dissipated; expl. as] meaning تَفَرَّقَتْ هُمُومُهُ [a
mistranscription, as before: correctly تفرّقت هِمَمُهُ
i. e. his purposes, or intentions, became disordered,
or unsettled: see also Ham p. 44, and Har p.
366]. (K.) And a rájiz says,
