شَفْرٌ: see the next paragraph, in four places.
شُفْرٌ The place of growth of the eyelash, (Sh, T,
S, A, Msb, K,) which is the edge of the eyelid;
(S, Msb;) as also ↓ شَفْرٌ (Kr, A, K) and ↓ شَفِيرٌ:
(K:) or, accord. to some, this last signifies the
upper side of the inner angle of the eye: (TA:)
and with the vulgar, the first signifies the eyelash; but this is [said to be] a mistake: (IKt,
Msb:) it occurs, however, in this sense, in a
trad. of Esh-Shaabee; (IAth, TA;) and in like
manner the pl. occurs in another trad.; but the
word شَعَر should be considered as understood
before it; or what grows is thus called by the
name of the places of growth, and the like of this
is not rare: (Mgh:) it is of the masc. gender:
(Lh, K:) and the pl. is أَشْفَارٌ, (Sb, S, Mgh, Msb,)
the only pl. form. (Sb, TA.) [Hence,] one says,
↓ مَا بِالدَّارِ شَفْرٌ, (Ks, Fr, T, S, Msb, K,) and شُفْرٌ,
(Lh, Msb, K,) but Sh disallows this latter, (TA,)
and ↓ شَفْرَةٌ, (Fr, Sgh, K,) (tropical:)  There is not in the
house any one: (S, Msb, K, &c.:) and مَا رَأَيْتُ
↓ مِنْهُمْ شَفْرًا (tropical:)  I saw not of them any one: from the
شفر of the eye: meaning one having a شفر: (A:)
and شفر is also used in this sense without a negation. (TA.) One says likewise, مَا تَرَكَتِ السَّنَةُ
ظُفْرًا وَلَا شُفْرًا (tropical:)  The year of drought left not
anything: and sometimes they said ↓ شَفْرًا, with
fet-h, and in this case they said ظَفْرًا, for assimilation. (A.) ―
-b2-  Also, (S A, Mgh, Msb, K,) and
↓ شَفِيرٌ, (S, A, Msb, K,) The edge, border, margin,
brink, brow, (S, Mgh, Msb,) or side, (A, K,) of
anything; (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K;) as of a valley
and the like, (S,) or as of a river &c.: (Mgh and
Msb, in relation to the latter word:) one says,
النَّهْرِ ↓ قَعَدُوا عَلَى شَفِيرِ, and البِئْرِ, and القَبْرِ, They
sat upon the side of the river, and of the well, and
of the grave: (A:) and both words signify the

the إِسْكَتَانِ are the two sides [or labia majora] of
the vulva of a woman; and the شُفْرَانِ are the
two borders of the said اسكتان: (AHeyth, Mgh,
TA:) Lth says that the ↓ شَافِرَانِ are [two parts]
of the pudendum muliebre: (TA:) and شُفْرُ الرَّحِمِ
and ↓ شَافِرُهَا signify [in like manner] the edges of
the vulva: (S:) and شُفْرَا المَرْأَةِ and ↓ شَافِرَاهَا, the
two edges of the رَحِم [or vulva (for الرَّحِم is here
used tropically, for الفَرْج, as it is in many other
instances,)] of a woman. (TA.)
