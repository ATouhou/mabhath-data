شرب1
شَرِبَ, (S, A, K, &c.,) aor.
شَرَبَ, (A, K,) inf. n. شُرْبٌ
and شَرْبٌ (S, A, Msb, K, &c.) and شِرْبٌ, (S, A, K,)
agreeably with three different readings of the Kur
lvi. 55, (S, TA,) the first of which (with damm)
is that generally obtaining, (Fr, TA,) and is the
only one admitted by Jaafar Ibn-Mohammad,
notwithstanding which the second form (with
fet-h) is said by MF to be the most chaste as well
as the most agreeable with analogy, (TA,) or the
second (with fet-h) is an inf. n., and the first is a
simple subst., (AO, S, Msb, K,) and so is the
third, (AO, S, K,) and مَشْرَبٌ, (S, K,) which is
also a n. of place [and of time], (S,) and تَشْرَابٌ,
(S K, TA,) a form used when muchness of the
act is meant, (TA,) and تِشْرَابٌ, which is anomalous, (TA voce بَيَّنَ, q. v.,) He drank, (KL,
PS, TK,) or he swallowed, syn. جَرِعَ, (A, K, [but
the former meaning is evidently intended by this
explanation, and such I shall assume to be the
case in giving the explanations of the derivatives in
the A and K. &c.,]) water, &c., (S,) or a liquid,
properly by sucking in, or sipping; and otherwise
tropically; (Msb;) [generally, gulping it; for]
you say, شَرِبَ المَآءَ فِى كَرَّةٍ [He drank the water
at once, or at a single draught]; and فِى ↓ تشرّبهُ
مُهْلَةٍ [He drank it leisurely, or gently, or slowly]:
(Mgh:) شُرْبٌ signifies the conveying to one's
inside, by means of his mouth, that in the case of
which chewing is not practicable: (KT:) [but]
Es-Sarakustee says, one does not say of a bird
شَرِبَ المَآءَ, but حَسَاهُ. (Msb.) In the saying of
Aboo-Dhu-eyb, describing clouds,
شَرِبْنَ بِمَآءِ البَحْرِ ثُمَّ تَرَفَّعَتْ
[which is evidently best rendered They drank of
the water of the sea, then rose aloft, agreeably
with what has been stated respecting بِ in the
sense of مِنْ in p. 143, it is said that] the ب is
redundant, or, as رَوِينَ is rendered trans. by
means of بِ, [though I do not think that this is
the case unless بِ be used as meaning “ by means
of,” and I do not remember to have met with an
instance of it,] شَرِبْنَ is thus rendered trans.
(TA.) [See a similar ex. in the 28th verse of the
Mo'allakah of 'Antarah, EM p. 232. One says
also, شَرِبَ فِى إِنَآءٍ, meaning He drank out of a
vessel; agreeably with an explanation of مِشْرَبَةٌ,
in the S and K, as meaning إِنَآءٌ يُشْرَبُ فِيهِ.] And
one says, إِنِّى لَأَمْكُثُ اليَوْمَيْنِ مَا أَشْرَبُهُمَا مَآءً, meaning مَا أَشْرَبُ فِيهِمَا مَآءً [i. e. Verily I tarry the two
days not drinking in them water]. (O.) ―
-b2-  [شَرِبَ
الدَّوَآءَ, in the conventional language of the physicians, as is indicated in the Mgh, voce بَنْجٌ
(q. v.), on the phrase شَرِبَ البَنْجَ, and as is shown
in many instances in the K &c., means He took,
i. e. swallowed, the medicine, whether fluid or
solid. ―
-b3-  And in the present day, they say, شَرِبَ
الدُّخَانَ, meaning He inhaled, properly imbibed,
smoke of tobacco; or he smoked tobacco, or the
tobacco.] ―
-b4-  One says of seed-produce, or corn,
when its culms have come forth, قَدْ شَرِبَ الزَّرْعُ
فِى القَصَبِ (assumed tropical:)  [The seed-produce, or corn, has
imbibed into the culms]: (O, TA:) and when the
sap (المَآء) has come into it, شَرِبَ قَصَبُ الزَّرْعِ
(assumed tropical:)  [The culms of the seed-produce, or corn, have
imbibed]. (TA.) And one says, شَرِبَ السُّنْبُلُ
الدَّقِيقَ (tropical:)  [The ears of corn imbibed the farina; or]
became pervaded by the farina; (En-Nadr, A,
O;) or had in them the alimentary substance;
as though the farina were water which they
drank. (TA.) And وَقَدْ شَرِبَ الزَّرْعُ الدَّقِيقَ, occurring in the story of Ohod, (O, TA,) as some
relate it, or ↓ شُرِّبَ as others relate it, means
(tropical:)  [And the seed-produce, or corn, had imbibed, or
had been made to imbibe, the farina, or] had
become hardened in its grain, and near to maturity. (TA.) [And ↓ أُشْرِبَ means the same:
for one says,] أُشْرِبَ الزَّرْعُ (tropical:)  [The seed-produce, or
corn, was made to imbibe the farina; or] became
pervaded by the farina: and in like manner,
أُشْرِبَ الزَّرْعُ الدَّقِيقَ, i. e. (tropical:)  [The seed-produce, or
corn, was made to imbibe the farina, or] its
alimentary substance. (TA.) ―
-b5-  One also says,
أَكَلَ غَنَمِى وَشَرِبَهَا (tropical:)  [He ate the flesh of my sheep,
or goats, and drank the milk of them]. (TA in
art. اكل.) And [in like manner] أَكَلَ فُلَانٌ مَالِى
وَشَرِبَهُ (tropical:)  [Such a one fed upon, devoured, or consumed,
my property]. (A.) And أَكَلَ عَلَيْهِ الدَّهْرُ وَشَرِبَ
(tropical:)  [Time wasted him, or wore him away; as though
it fed upon him]. (A.) ―
-b6-  And مَا لَمْ ↓ أَشْرَبْتَنِى
أَشْرَبْ [lit. Thou hast made me to drink what I
have not drunk,] meaning (tropical:)  thou hast charged
against me, or accused me of doing, what I have
not done; (S, A, K;) like أَكَّلْتَنِى مَا لَمْ آكُلْ.
(S in art. اكل.) ―
-b7-  شَرِبَ also signifies He was,
or became, satisfied with drinking: (TA:) and in
like manner شَرِبَت is said of camels. (A 'Obeyd,
S, TA.) And He was, or became, thirsty; (K,
TA;) thus having two contr. significations; (TA;)
as also ↓ أَشْرَبَ. (K, TA.) ―
-b8-  Also, and ↓ أَشْرَبَ,
His camels were, or became, satisfied with drinking: and, i. e. both these verbs, his camels were,
or became, thirsty: (K, TA:) or the former verb
signifies, or signifies also, (accord. to different
copies of the K,) his camel was, or became, weak.
(K, TA.)
-A2-  شَرِبَ بِهِ, and بِهِ ↓ أَشْرَبَ, He lied
against him. (K.)
-A3-  شَرَبَ, aor.
شَرُبَ, (O, K, TA,)
inf. n. شَرْبٌ, (O, TA,) He understood: (O, K,
TA:) on the authority of AA. (TA.) [In a
copy of the A, the verb in this sense is written
شَرِبَ; and app. not through the fault of the
transcriber, for it is there mentioned as tropical:
but in the O, it is said to be like كَتَبَ, aor.
شَرُبَ,
inf. n. كَتْبٌ; and in the K, to be like نَصَرَ.] One
says, شَرَبَ مَا أُلْقِىَ إِلَيْهِ, i. e. He understood [what
was told to him]. (TA.) And one says to a
stupid person, اُحْلُبْ ثُمَّ اشْرُبْ Kneel thou; then
understand. (O, TA. See also 1 in art. حلب.)
2
شَرَّبَ [شرّبهُ, inf. n. تَشْرِيبٌ, He made him to drink
water &c.; and so, as is indicated in the S and K
&c., and as is well known, ↓ أَشْرَبَهُ: and] شَرَّبْتُ
المَآءَ I gave to drink the water; as also ↓ أَشْرَبْتُهُ.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] one says, ظَلَّ مَالِى يُؤَكَّلُ
وَيُشَرَّبُ [lit. My cattle passed the day made to eat
and made to drink,] i. e. (assumed tropical:)  pasturing as they
pleased. (S, TA.) And شَرَّبَ مَالِى وَأَكَّلَهُ [lit.
He made people to drink my property, and made
them to eat it; or to drink the milk of my cattle,
and to eat the flesh thereof;] i. e. (assumed tropical:)  he fed people,

[of] my property, or cattle. (S, TA.) ―
-b3-  And
شرّب الأَرْضَ وَالنَّخْلَ (assumed tropical:)  He gave drink to the land
and the palm-trees. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And شرّب لُقْمَةً

تَشْرِيبٌ, (A 'Obeyd, K,) (assumed tropical:)  I rendered the water-skin sweet; (K;) I put into the water-skin, it
being new, clay and water, in order to render its

3
شاربهُ, (S, A, K, TA,) inf. n. مُشَارَبَةٌ and
شِرَابٌ, He drank with him; namely, a man.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  [And He watered his camels, &c. with

him for the watering of camels &c.:] see an ex.
of the latter inf. n. in a verse cited voce شَرِيبٌ.
4
أَشْرَبَ see 2, in two places. One says, أَشْرَبْتُ
الإِبِلَ حَتَّى شَرِبَتْ [I made the camels to drink
until they were satisfied with drinking; or I
watered the camels, or gave them to drink, &c.];
(S, TA;) [for] أَشْرَبَ is syn. with سَقَى. (K.) ―
-b2-
[Hence,] الثَّوْبُ يُشْرَبُ الصٍّبْغَ: see 5. And أُشْرِبَ

imbued, or saturated, with redness. (A.) And

أُشْرِبَ الأَبْيَضُ حُمْرَةً (assumed tropical:)  The white was suffused, or
tinged over, with redness. (S, TA.) ―
-b3-  [Hence, أُشْرِبَ
is also said of a sound, as meaning (assumed tropical:)  It was mixed
with another sound; as appears from the words
here following:] حِسُّ الصَّوْتِ فِى الفَمِ مِمَّا لَا إِشْرَابَ
لَهُ مِنْ صَوْتِ الصَّدْرِ (assumed tropical:)  [The faint, or gentle, sound of

half. ―

حُبَّ فُلَانٍ, (K,) or حُبَّ فُلَانَةَ, (A,) (tropical:)  [He was
made to imbibe into his heart the love of him, or
of such a man, or of such a female;] meaning
that the love of him, or of her, pervaded, or commingled with, his heart, (S, A, K, TA,) like
beverage. (TA.) Whence, in the Kur [ii. 87],
وَأُشْرِبُوا فِى قُلُوبِهِمُ الْعِجْلَ, for حُبَّ العِجْلِ, (S,
TA,) i. e. (assumed tropical:)  And they were made to imbibe [into
their hearts] the love of the calf.. (Zj, TA.) ―

half. ―
-b8-  And one says to his she-camel, لَأُشْرِبَنَّكِ
الحِبَالَ (tropical:)  [I will assuredly put upon thee the ropes,
or cords], and العِقَالَ [the cord, or rope, with
which the fore shank and the arm are bound
together]. (A.) [Or] اشربهُ means (tropical:)  He put the
rope, or cord, upon his neck; namely, a man's,
(K, TA,) and a camel's, and a horse's or the like:
(TA:) and اشرب الخَيْلَ he put the ropes, or
cords, upon the necks of the horses. (K,) And
اشرب إِبِلَهُ (tropical:)  He tied his camels, every one to
another. (K, TA.)
-A2-  اشرب as an intrans. verb:
see 1, last quarter, in two places. ―

his camels. (K, * TA.)

تَشَرَّبَ see 1, first sentence. ―
-b2-  Hence one says,
(Mgh,) تشرّب الثَّوْبُ العَرَقَ, (S, Mgh, * K,) and
الصِّبْغَ, (A, Mgh, L,) (tropical:)  The garment, or piece of
cloth, imbibed, or absorbed, (S, A, Mgh, * L, K,)
the sweat, (S, Mgh, K,) and the dye; (A, Mgh,
L;) as though it drank it by little and little:
(Mgh:) and [in like manner] one says, الثَّوْبُ
يشرب الصِّبْغَ [app. ↓ يُشْرَبُ, (like as one says
يُشْرَبُ حُمْرَةً, as shown in the next preceding
paragraph,) meaning (assumed tropical:)  The garment, or piece of
cloth, is made to imbibe, or absorb, the dye].
(TA.) [It is said that] the verb is not used intransitively in the [proper] language of the Arabs.
(Mgh.) [But] one says, تشرّب الصِّبْغُ فِى الثَّوْبِ,
meaning (tropical:)  The dye pervaded the garment, or
piece of cloth: (K, * TA:) and الصِّبْغُ يَتَشَرَّبُ الثَّوْبَ
(tropical:)  [The dye pervades the garment, or piece of
cloth]. (TA.) [See also the explanation of a
verse cited voce تَسَقَّى.]

intense. (K.) And استشربت القَوْسُ حُمْرَةً (assumed tropical:)  The

Q. Q. 4
اِشْرَأَبّ, (S, A, O, K,) inf. n. اِشْرِئْبَابٌ,
(S, O,) (tropical:)  He raised his head like the camel that
has satisfied his thirst on the occasion of drinking:
(A:) or he stretched forth his neck to look: (S,
A, O, K:) not improbably, from الشُّرْبُ in its
well known sense, as though he did so when
preparing to drink: (O:) or, as is said in the L,
from مَشْرَبَةٌ as syn. with غُرْفَةٌ: (TA:) you say,
اِشْرَأَبَّ لَهُ, (S, A,) or إِلَيْهِ, (K,) or both; (TA;)
[the former of which may be rendered He raised
his head at it, or he stretched forth his neck at it
to look; or, as also the latter, he stretched forth
his neck to look at it;] namely, a thing: (S:) or
اشرأبّ originally means he stretched forth his
neck in preparing to drink water: and then, in
consequence of frequency of usage, he raised his
head, and stretched forth his neck, in looking;
and hence is trans. by means of إِلَى: (Har p.
152:) or he raised, or exalted, himself. (K, * TA.)
يَشْرَئِبُّونَ لِصَوْتِهِ, occurring in a trad., means (tropical:)  They

شُرْبٌ an inf. n. of شَرِبَ [q. v.]; (S, A, Msb, K,
&c.;) like ↓ شِرْبٌ: (S, A, K:) or a simple subst.
[signifying The act of drinking]; (AO, S Msb,
K;) as also ↓ شِرْبٌ. (AO, S, K.)
-A2-  In the phrase
أَخُوكَ شُرْبٌ it is used as [an epithet,] meaning ذُو
شُرْبٍ [which may be regarded as virtually syn.
with شَارِبٌ or as similar to this latter but intensive
in signification]. (Ham p. 194.)

places. ―
-b2-  Also Water, (K, TA,) itself; so some
say; (TA;) as also ↓ مِشْرَبٌ, (K, accord. to the

art. سلف, conj. 4.] ―
-b4-  And A share, or portion
that falls to one's lot, of water: (S, Mgh, Msb,
K:) or so شِرْبٌ مِنْ مَآءٍ. (ISk, TA.) It is said in
a prov., آخِرُهَا أَقَلُّهَا شِرْبًا [The last of them is the
one of them that has the least share of water]:
originating from the watering of camels; because
the last of them sometimes comes to the water
when the watering-trough has been exhausted.
(S. [See also Freytag's Arab. Prov. i. 61.]) ―
-b5-
As a law-term, it means The use of water [or the
right to use it] for the watering of sown-fields
and of beasts. (Mgh.) ―
-b6-  Also A wateringplace; syn. مَوْرِدٌ: (AZ, K:) pl. as above. (TA.)
―
-b7-  And (assumed tropical:)  A time of drinking: (K:) but they say
that it denotes the time only by a sort of tropical
application; and they differ respecting the connexion of this meaning with the proper meaning.

شَرَبٌ: see شَرَبَةٌ, in two places.
شَرْبَةٌ A single act of drinking. (S.) ―
-b2-  And
A single draught, or the quantity that is drunk

نِعْمَ مِعْلَقُ الشَّرْبَةِ هٰذَا [Excellent, or most excellent,
is the traveller's drinking-cup, or bowl, that will
hold a single draught, namely, this!]: the مِعْلَق
is said by As to be a drinking-cup or bowl which
the rider upon a camel suspends [to his saddle]:
(Meyd:) it is said in describing a camel: (TA:)
and it means that, to the place of alighting to
which he desires to go, he is content with a single
draught, not wanting another: (Meyd, TA:) the
prov. is applied to him who, in his affairs, is
content with his own opinion, not wanting that of
another person. (Meyd.) شَرْبَةُ أَبِى الجَهْمِ [The
draught of Abu-l-Jahm] is said of a thing that is
sweet, or pleasant, but in its result unwholesome:
(MF, TA:) Abu-l-Jahm was a frequent visiter of
the Khaleefeh El-Mansoor El-'Abbásee, who,
finding him troublesome, ordered that a poisoned
draught should be given to him, in his presence:
which having been done, Abu-l-Jahm, pained by
the draught, rose to depart; and being asked by
the Khaleefeh whither he was going, he answered,
Whither thou hast sent me, O Prince of the
Faithful. (MF.) ―
-b3-  In the Mo'allakah of Tarafeh,
it is applied to A draught of wine. (EM p. 87.)
―
-b4-  [In the conventional language of the physicians, it is a term applied to A dose of medicine,
such as is drunk and also such as is eaten.]
-A2-
Also A palm-tree that grows from the date stone:
(K:) pl. شَرَبَاتٌ. (TA. [It seems to be there
added that شَرَائِبُ and شَرَابِيبُ are also its pls.:
the former may be like ضَرَائِرُ pl. of ضَرَّةٌ: the
latter is app. a mistranscription, and should perhaps be شَرَائِيبُ, for شَرَائِبُ; like مَحَامِيرُ for مَحَامِرُ,
&c.])
شُرْبَةٌ, (K,) or شُرْبَةٌ مِنْ مَآءٍ, (S,) The quantity
of water that satisfies thirst. (S, K.) ―

made, (S,) or dug, (TA,) around a palm-tree,
(S, K, TA,) and around any other kind of tree,
and filled with water, (TA,) holding enough to
irrigate it fully, (K, TA,) so that it is plentifully
irrigated thereby: (S, TA:) pl. ↓ شَرَبٌ [or rather
this is a coll. gen. n., of which the former is the
n. un.,] and [the pl. properly so termed is]
شَرَبَاتٌ. (S.) ―
-b2-  And i. q. كُرْدُ دَبْرَةٍ, (K, TA,)
which is syn. with مَسْقَاةٌ: (TA:) [from a comparison of the explanations of all of these words, it
seems to mean A channel of water for the irrigation of a plot, or tract, of sown land: or, if the
explanation مسقاة, in the TA, be conjectural, the
meaning may be a portion of such land, having
a raised border to retain the water admitted upon
it:] pl. شَرَبَاتٌ and [coll. gen. n.] ↓ شَرَبٌ [as
above]. (TA.)
-A4-  Also Thirst. (Lh, T, O, K.)

to have thirst to-day. (Lh, TA.) And جَآءَتِ
الإِبِلُ وَبِهَا شَرَبَةٌ The camels came thirsty. (T, O.)
And طَعَامٌ ذُو شَرَبَةٍ Food wherewith one has not
sufficient water to satisfy thirst. (O, TA.) Accord. to the L, شَرَبَةٌ signifies The thirst of cattle
after the being satisfied with fresh pasture; because this invites to drink. (TA.) ―

of being, or acting &c. (S, O, K.) One says,

in whatever state it be; thus in a copy of the K:
(TA:) and syn. with شَرَابٌ are ↓ شَرِيبٌ and
↓ شَرُوبٌ, (K,) accord. to a saying attributed to
AZ: (TA:) or these two have another meaning,
expl. in the next paragraph: (K:) the pl. of
شَرَابٌ is أَشْرِبَةٌ; (Mgh, TA;) or it has no pl., as is
said in the K in art. نهر [accord. to one or more
of the copies; but see نَهَارٌ, where it is shown that
in copies of the K, as well as in the S, the word
to which this statement relates is سَرَابٌ, with the
unpointed س]. (TA.) The lawyers [and generally the post-classical writers, and sometimes
others,] mean thereby [Win, and] such beverage
as is forbidden. (Mgh.) [Also Sirup: pl. شَرَابَاتٌ:
so in the language of the present day.]
شَرُوبٌ and ↓ شَرِيبٌ are syn. with شَرَابٌ, q. v.:
or both signify Water inferior to the عَذْب [or
sweet]: (K:) or [brackish water; i. e.] water
between the salt and the sweet: (AO, S:) or water
drinkable, or fit to be drunk, but in which is
disagreeableness: (Msb:) or the former signifies
water that has some degree of sweetness, and is
sometimes drunk by men notwithstanding what is
in it; and ↓ the latter, water inferior to what is
sweet, and not drunk by men save in cases of
necessity, but sometimes drunk by cattle: (IKtt,
TA:) or ↓ the latter, the sweet: and the former
is said to signify water that is drunk: (TA:) or
↓ the latter, water that has no sweetness in it, but
is sometimes drunk by men notwithstanding what
is in it; and the former, water inferior to this in
sweetness, and not drunk by men save in cases of
necessity: (AZ, T, M, TA:) or, accord. to Lth,
↓ شَرِيبٌ and ↓ شِرِّيبٌ signify water in which are
bitterness and saltness, but not abstained from as
drink: and مَآءٌ شَرُوبٌ and طَعِيمٌ are syn.: and
↓ مَآءٌ مِشْرَبٌ is syn. with شَرُوبٌ: this last word is
used alike as masc. and fem. and sing. and pl.
(TA.) It is said in a prov., originally in a trad.,
جُرْعَةُ شَرُوبٍ أَنْفَعُ مِنْ عَذْبٍ مُوبٍ [expl. in art.
وبأ]. (TA.)
-A2-  Also, شَرُوبٌ, A man who drinks

of another: of the measure فَعِيلٌ in the sense of
the measure مُفَاعِلٌ: (S:) and one who draws
water, or is given to drink, with another. (IAar,
K.) You say, هُوَ شَرِيِبِى [He is my companion in
drinking; or in watering his camels with mine:
&c.]. (TA.) And a rájiz says,
رُبَّ شَرِيبٍ لَكَ ذِى حُسَاسِ
كَالحَزِّ بِالمَوَاسِى ↓ شِرَابُهُ
[Many a one who waters his camels with thine,
or who draws water with thee for the watering of
camels, having an evil disposition, his watering
&c. is like the cutting with razors]: i. e., thy
waiting for him at the watering-trough is [a cause
of] killing to thee and to thy camels. (TA.)
شَرِيبَةٌ is expl. in the S as meaning A sheep, or
goat, which one drives back, or brings back, from
the water, when the sheep, or goats, are satisfied
with drinking, and which they follow: but in
some of the copies in a marginal note stating that
the correct word is سَرِيبَةٌ, with the unpointed س.

signifying (tropical:)  A raising of the head like the camel

present day: probably post-classical: pl. شَرَارِيبُ.]
شَارِبٌ Drinking, or a drinker: pl. شَارِبُونَ
(Msb) and ↓ شَرْبٌ, like as صَحْبٌ is of صَاحِبٌ,
(S, Msb,) or, accord. to ISd, (TA,) شَرْبٌ, which
signifies people drinking, (K, TA,) and assembling
for drinking, is a quasi.-pl. n. of شَارِبٌ, being like
رَكْبٌ and رَجْلٌ; and شُرُوبٌ, which is said by
IAar [and in the S] to be pl. of شَرْبٌ, is pl. of
شَارِبٌ, like as شُهُودٌ is of شَاهِدٌ; (TA;) شَرَبَةٌ also
is allowable as a pl. of شَارِبٌ, like as كَفَرَةٌ is pl.
of كَافِرٌ; (Msb;) and أَشْرُبٌ is pl. of شَرْبٌ, or it
may be an anomalous pl. of شَارِبٌ: (MF:) the
pl. شُرُوب occurs in the saying of El-Aashà,
هُوَ الوَاهِبُ المُسْمِعَاتِ الشُّرُو
بَ بَيْنَ الحَرِيرِ وَبَيْنَ الكَتَنْ
[He is the giver of female singers to the drinkers,
some clad in silk and some in linen]. (S.) ―
-b2-  See
also شِرِّيبٌ. ―
-b3-  [Hence, The mustache; i. e.] the
defluent hair over the mouth; (Msb;) or so
شَوَارِبُ, (Lh, A, K,) which is the pl., (Lh, S,
Msb,) as though the sing, applied to every distinct
part: (Lh:) the two [halves] are called شَارِبَانِ:
(S, TA:) or, as some say, only the sing. is used,
and the dual is a mistake: (TA:) accord. to
AHát (Msb, TA) and AAF, (TA,) the dual is
is scarcely ever, or never, used; but accord. to
AO, the Kilábees say شَارِبَانِ, with regard to the
two extremities: (Msb, TA:) and the pl., (A,
K,) or, accord. to the T &c., the dual, (TA,)
signifies the long portions [of the hair] on the two
sides of the سَبَلَة [q. v.]: (T, A, K, TA:) or (K,
TA) شَارِبٌ signifies the سَبَلَة altogether, (A, K,
TA,) as some say; but this is not correct. (TA.)
One says, طَرَّ شَارِبُ الغُلَامِ [The mustache of the
boy, or young man, grew forth]. (S.) ―
-b4-  And
hence, as being likened to the two long portions
of hair on each side of the سَبَلَة, the شَارِبَانِ of the
sword, (T, TA,) i. e. (tropical:)  Two long projections
(أَنْفَانِ طَوِيلَانِ) at the lower part of the hilt,
(A, * K, TA,) [extending from the guard,] one on
one side and the other on the other side of the
blade, (T, * TA,) the غَاشِيَة [or leathern covering
of the scabbard] being beneath them: so says ISh.
(TA.) ―
-b5-  الشَّوَارِبُ also signifies (tropical:)  The عُرُوق [or
ducts] of the حُلْقُوم [or windpipe]: (A:) or certain ducts (عُرُوق) in the حَلْق [i. e. fauces or
throat], (K, TA,) that imbibe the water [or
saliva?], being the channels thereof: (TA:) and,
(K,) or, as some say, (TA,) the channels of the
water [or saliva?] (S, K, TA) in the حَلْق [i. e.
fauces or throat] (S) or in the neck: (K, TA:)
or certain ducts (عُرُوق) adhering to the windpipe,
and the lower parts thereof to the lungs: so says
IDrd: or rather, some say, the hinder part
thereof [adhering] to the وَتِين [or aorta], having
tubes from which the voice issues, and in which
choking takes place, and whence the saliva issues:
and those of the horse are said to be [certain
ducts] by the side of the أَوْدَاج [or external
jugular veins], where the veterinary surgeon
draws blood by cutting the اوداج: the sing. seems
by implication to be شَارِبٌ. (TA.) Hence the
phrase حِمَارٌ صَخِبُ الشَّوَارِبِ (assumed tropical:)  An ass that brays
vehemently. (S, TA.) And صَخِبُ الشَّوَارِبِ (tropical:)  [A
man] having a disagreeable voice: thus likened
to an ass. (A, TA.) ―
-b6-  Accord. to IAar, الشَّوَارِبُ
signifies [also] مَجَارِى المَآءِ فِى العَيْنِ, which AM
supposes to mean The channels of water in the
spring, or source; not in the eye. (L, TA.) ―
-b7-
سُنْبُلٌ شَارِبُ قَمْحٍ means (tropical:)  Ears of corn becoming,
or being, pervaded by the farina: (A, TA:) or,

(عِرْق) thereof; as in the saying, نِعْمَ البَعِيرُ هٰذَا لَوْلَا
أَنَّ فِيهِ شَارِبَ خَوَرٍ (assumed tropical:)  [Excellent, or most excellent,
were the camel, this one, were there not in him a
strain of weakness or feebleness]. (TA.)
شَارِبَةٌ [a subst. from شَارِبٌ, made such by the
affix ة,] A people, or party, dwelling upon the
side (ضَفَّة, in some copies of the K صُفَّة,) of a
