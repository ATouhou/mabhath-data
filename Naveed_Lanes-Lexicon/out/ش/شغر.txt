شغر1
شَغڤرَ The inf. n. شَغْرٌ, accord. to Ibn-Nubáteh,
primarily signifies The raising the leg or hind leg,
without restriction; and then by a metaphorical
usage, the doing so for the purpose of copulation,
and for making water: but the explanations of J
[and of Z in the A] and of Fei and of F are at
variance with his assertion. (MF.) [Accord. to
these authorities,] شَغَرَ, (S, A, Msb, K,) aor.
شَغَرَ,
(S, Msb, K,) inf. n. as above, (Msb, TA,) signifies
He (a dog) raised one of his hind legs (S, A, Msb,
K) to make water, (S, Msb,) or and made water,
or whether he made water or did not: (A, K:)
and شَغَرَ بِرِجْلِهِ he (a dog) raised his hind leg, and
made water. (TA.) And شَغَرَتْ She (a camel)
raised her hind leg, and struck [with it, or kicked,]
the young one. (A.) And, said of a woman,
(Msb, K,) She raised her leg, (Msb, and so in
some copies of the K,) or her legs, (so in other

(Msb, K.) And the verb is also trans.: you say,
شَغَرَ المَرْأَةَ, (Msb, K,) inf. n. شُغُورٌ, (K, [but this
is a strange form in the case of a trans. verb,])
He raised the woman's leg, (Msb, and so in some
copies of the K) or legs, (IDrd, O, and so in
some copies of the K,) for the purpose of copulation; and so ↓ اشغرها. (IDrd, O, Msb, K.)
And شَغْرٌ as the act of a stallion [camel] signifies
His striking with his head beneath the she-camel,
at the part next the udder, and so raising her,
and throwing her down [app. for the purpose of
copulation]. (K.) ―

of a guardian, or protector, to defend it: (Msb:)
