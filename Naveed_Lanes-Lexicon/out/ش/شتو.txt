خَرَفِىٌّ, (S,) [signifying Of, or relating to, the
season called شِتَآء,] are rel. ns. of شِتَآءٌ (S, Msb, K)
regarded as pl. of شَتْوَةٌ: (Msb:) or it may be
that they formed the rel. n. from شَتْوَةٌ, and discarded that of شِتَآءٌ; as is said in the M: (TA:)
or those who regard شِتَآءٌ as a sing. make its rel. n.
to be ↓ شِتَائِىٌّ and ↓ شِتَاوِىٌّ. (Msb, TA.) ―
-b2-
الشَّتَوِىُّ, (S, K,) thus with fet-h to the ش and ت,
(K,) signifies also The rain of the [season called]

the season called الرَّبِيعُ الأَوَّلُ and رَبِيعُ الكَلَأِ, commencing in January and ending in March: see
the former of the two tables mentioned above]:
(Aboo-Nasr, TA voce صَفَرِىٌّ [q. v.]:) [and in
like manner, of camels; for] شَتْوِىٌّ and شَتَوِىٌّ and
↓ شَتِىٌّ are applied to the young camel brought
forth by her that is termed ↓ مُشْتٍ, meaning
مُرْبِعٌ [i. e. that brings forth in the (season called)
رَبِيع]. (TA.)
شِتَآءٌ a word of well-known meaning [in the
sense in which it is most commonly used, i. e.
Winter]; (S;) one of the quarters [of the circle]
of the seasons; (K;) and ↓ شَاتَاةٌ signifies the
same; (Sgh, K;) [and so does ↓ شَتِيَّةٌ; (see an
ex. voce رِبْعِىٌّ;)] and so does ↓ مَشْتَاةٌ: (Msb,
TA:) [also the half-year commencing at the
autumnal equinox:] ISk says, السَّنَةُ is with the
Arabs a name for twelve months: then they
divided it into two halves, and commenced the
سَنَة [or year] at the commencement of the شِتَآء
because this word is masc. and the word صَيْف
[meaning in this case the “ half-year commencing
at the vernal equinox ”] is fem.: then they divided
the شِتَآء into two halves; the شتوى being the
former; and the ربيع, the latter; [but this is a
manifest mistake, probably attributable to a
copyist; for, as is well known, the former half is
called the رَبِيع; and the latter, the شِتَآء or ↓ شَتْوَة;]
each consisting of three months; and in like
manner the صَيْف and the قَيْظ consist, each, of
three months: (TA:) also one of the six seasons
into which the year is divided, each whereof consists of two months; namely, the season [commencing in November and ending in January,]
next after that called الخَرِيفُ: (S and K voce
رَبِيعٌ: [see this word; and see, again, the former
of the two tables mentioned above:]) accord. to
Mbr, (S,) شِتَآءٌ is pl. of ↓ شَتْوَةٌ; (S, Msb, K;) it
is said to be so by IF on the authority of Kh,
and by some on the authority of Fr or some
other: or شِتَآءٌ and ↓ شَتْوَةٌ signify the same, (K,)
as is said in the M; (TA;) [i. e.] some say that
الشِّتَآءُ is a proper name for the quarter [&c.]:
(Msb:) the pl. is أَشْتِيَةٌ, (S, Msb, K,) i. e. pl. of
شِتَآءٌ, (S, Msb,) because أَفْعِلَةٌ, as pl. of فِعَالٌ, is
peculiar to a masc. [noun]; (Msb;) and شُتِىٌّ
also, (K, TA,) originally أُشْتُوىٌ [a mistake for
شُتُوىٌ], written in the Tekmileh شِتِىٌّ, as on the
authority of Fr.: (TA:) the pl. of its syn. ↓ مَشْتَاةٌ
is مَشَاتٍ. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  Also, i. e. شِتَآءٌ, Hail, syn.
بَرَدٌ, (K, TA, [in the CK بَرْدٌ,]) that falls from the
sky. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And Drought, or dearth: (K,
and Ham pp. 117 and 150:) this meaning being
assigned to the شتآء exclusively of the صَيْف because in it the people keep to the tents, not going
forth to seek after herbage. (TA.)

شَتِيَّةٌ: see شِتَآءٌ [with which it is syn.].
شِتَائِىٌّ and شِتَاوِىٌّ: see شَتْوِىٌّ.
شَاتٍ Entering the شِتَآء, which, with them, [i. e.
the Arabs, and app. in this case,] means [a season

-b2-
يَوْمٌ شَاتٍ A day intensely cold: (Msb:) or a day
in which is بَرَد [i. e. hail (accord. to the CK بَرْد)];
and in like manner غَدَاةٌ شَاتِيَةٌ [a morning in
which is hail]. (K, TA.)
شَاتَاةٌ: see its syn. شِتَآءٌ.
مَشْتًى The place [in which one resides, stays,
dwells, or abides, during the season] of the شِتَآء
[or winter, &c.]; as also ↓ مَشْتَاةٌ: (K:) pl. مَشَاتٍ.
(TA.)
مُشْتٍ: see شَتْوِىٌّ, last sentence. ―
-b2-  It is said in
a trad., as some relate it, وَالنَّاسُ مُرْمِلُونَ مُشْتُونَ,
meaning The people being in a state of straitness,
or dearth, and hunger, and paucity of milk: but
IAth says that the reading commonly known is
مُسْنِتُونَ. (TA.)
مَشْتَاةٌ: see شِتَآءٌ, in two places: ―
-b2-  and مَشْتًى.
