needful, or requisite, thing, affair, or business:
(S, K:) or the former signifies wants: (Ham p.
716:) A'Obeyd says that the former word is the
more correct, because شُقُورٌ signifies things, or
affairs, that cleave to the heart, disquieting it;
and is pl. of ↓ شَقْرٌ; and that ↓ شَقُورٌ, with fet-h,
has the signification of an epithet [meaning
cleaving to the heart and disquieting it]: (S:) or,
accord. to some, this latter signifies grief, mourning, sorrow, or sadness; disquietude of mind: or
disquietude of mind that causes one to be sleepless:
the former is also expl. as signifying a man's case,

my want; like as one says أَفْضَيْتُ إِلَيْهِ بِعُجَرِى
وَبُجَرِى: (S:) or I acquainted him with my
tidings. (TA.) And أَفْضَيْتُ إِلَيْهِ بِشُقُورِى I acquainted him with my case, and with what I kept
secret from others; (TA;) and so نَفَضْتُ لَهُ
شُقُورِى: (Ham p. 716:) or I revealed to him my
