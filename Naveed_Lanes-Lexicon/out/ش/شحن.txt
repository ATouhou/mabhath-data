تَأَطَّرْنَ فِى المِينَآءِ ثُمَّ تَرَكْنَهُ

may be, accord. to him, an inf. n. of شَحَنَ, or an
extr. pl. of شِحْنَةٌ: (L:) [but I rather think that
it is a pl. of ↓ شَاحِنٌ, like as شُهُودٌ is of شَاهِدٌ; and
accordingly I would render the verse (which
evidently relates to ships) thus: They kept close
in the port, then they left it, and laders had persisted in contention by reason of their burdens,
i. e. the burdens of the ships, because of the
labour that they occasioned.]

another with rancour, &c., being so regarded, or
treated by him: see 3]. (S, L.) المُشَاحِنُ as
used in a trad. means The schismatic innovator
in religion: (L, K:) so says El-Owzá'ee: or the
transgressor: (L:) or it means he who has in his
