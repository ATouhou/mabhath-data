شوش2
شوّش عَلَيْهِ الأَمْرَ, inf. n. تَشْوِيشٌ, He rendered the affair, or state, or case, confused, disordered, or perplexed, to him: (El-Fárábee, S, *
Msb: the inf. n., and that only, mentioned in the
S in art. شيش:) or, accord. to certain of those
skilled in the abstrusities and niceties of science,
شوّش is a post-classical word, and the chaste word
is هَوَّشَ: accord. to IAmb, the leading lexicologists hold that one should only say هوّش; and
Az and others say the same: (Msb:) [F also
says,] تَشْوِيشٌ is a mistake for تَهْوِيشٌ. (K.) See
also شَوَاشٍ.

of أَشْوَسُ, q. v.]. (O, K.)
شَوْشَآءُ and شَوْشَاةٌ, (Lth, O, K,) or the former is
a mistake, (TA,) the latter said by Az to be that
which he heard from the Arabs, (O, TA,) applied
to a she-camel, Light, or agile: (Lth, O, K:) or,
so applied, swift: (A'Obeyd, O:) and applied to
a woman as an epithet of discommendation. (O.)
A poet, cited by AA, applies the epithet ↓ شَوَاشِئ,
with hemz, by poetic license, to a نَاضِح [properly
meaning a camel upon which water is drawn from
a well]; originally from شَوْشَآءُ, (O,) or شَوْشَاةٌ,
(TA,) meaning “ Light,” or “ agile,” applied to
a she-camel: so says AA. (O, TA.)

vulgar say ↓ تَشْوِيشٌ. (O, TA.)
شَوَاشِئ: see شَوْشَآءُ.

small turban (دَسْتَارْچَهْ). (KL. [Comp. مِشْوَذٌ.])
مُشَاوِشٌ Water not to be seen, (K,) or hardly to
be seen, (TA,) by reason of its remoteness [from
the surface of the ground] or its paucity: (K:) a
dial. var. of مُشَاوِسٌ [q. v.]. (TA.)
