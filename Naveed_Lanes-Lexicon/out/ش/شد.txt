شد1
شَدَّ, as an intrans. verb, aor.
شَدِ3َ, inf. n. شِدَّةٌ:
see 8; and see also شِدَّةٌ. ―
-b2-  [Hence,] لَشَدَّ مَا is an
expression used in the same sense as لَعَزَّ مَا (A
and K in art. عز) and لَحَقَّ مَا: (A and TA in that
art.:) [and in like manner without the ل: thus]
one says, شَدَّ مَا أَنَّكَ ذَاهِبٌ, meaning حَقَّ أَنَّكَ ذَاهِبٌ
[i. e. It is distressing, or it distresses me, that
thou art going away]: and if you please, you may
consider شَدَّ as similar to نِعْمَ; as when you say,
نِعْمَ العَمَلُ أَنَّكَ تَقُولُ الحَقَّ [Excellent, or most
excellent, is the deed, thy saying the truth].
(Sb, TA.) [And it is also used to render intensive
a verb following it; as in the saying, لَشَدَّ مَا
أَبْغَضَنِى Much indeed, or greatly indeed, did he
hate me.] ―
-b3-  شَدَّ عَلَيْهِ, aor.
شَدَ3َ (S, L) and
شَدِ3َ, (L,)
inf. n. شَدٌّ (S, L) and شُدُودٌ, (L,) He charged, or
made an assault or attack, upon him, in war, or
battle. (S, L.) You say, شَدَّ عَلَى العَدُوِّ شَدَّةً
وَاحِدَةً, and شَدَّاتٍ كَثِيرَةً, He made one charge, or
assault, or attack, upon the enemy, and many
charges, &c. (L.) And شَدَّ عَلَى قِرْنِهِ بِسِكِّينٍ, or
بِعَصًا, He made an assault, or attack, upon his
adversary, with a knife, or with a staff; as also
عَلَيْهِ ↓ اشتدّ. (Mgh.) And شَدَّ الذِّئْبُ عَلَى الغَنَمِ
The wolf asaulted, or attacked, the sheep or goats.
(L.) In the phrase, شَدُّوا الإِغَارَةَ, the meaning is
شَدُّوا لِلْإِغَارَةِ [They made a charge for the purpose
of a sudden attack upon an enemy, or a predatory
incursion]; and therefore الاغارة is put in the
accus. case, not as an objective complement.
(Ham p. 8.) ―
-b4-  شَدَّ, (S,) aor.
شَدُ3َ and
شَدِ3َ, (TK,)
inf. n. شَدٌّ, (S, L, K,) also signifies He ran; (S,
L, * K; *) and so ↓ اشتدّ. (S, L, K.) رُبَّ شَدٍّ فِى
الكُرْزِ [Many a run is in the sack] is a prov.,
originating from the fact that a man riding a
pregnant mare was pursued by an enemy, and
she cast her foal, which ran with its mother,
whereupon the horseman alighted, and carried it
off in a sack; and the enemy overtook him, and
said to him, “Throw to me the foal;” and he
replied in these words, meaning that the foal was
of generous race: it is applied to him whose
internal, or intrinsic, qualities are commended.
(Meyd.) And one says, شَدَّ فِى العَدْوِ, (A, Mgh,
L,) inf. n. شَدٌّ; (L;) and ↓ اشتدّ; (A, Mgh, L;)
He hastened, or was quick, in running: (Mgh,
L:) and شَدَّ الإِحْضَارَ [meaning the same]. (S in
art. افر.) ―
-b5-  شَدَّ النَّهَارُ, (S, L,) and الضُّحَى, (L,)
inf. n. شَدٌّ; (L, K; but in the latter, النَّار is erroneously put for النَّهَار; TA;) and ↓ اشتدّ; (L;)
The day, and the morning, became advanced, the
sun being high. (S, * L, K. *) [See also شَدٌّ below.]
-A2-  شَدَّهُ, aor.
شَدُ3َ (S, A, L, Msb) and
شَدِ3َ, the latter
anomalous, for the aor. of a trans. verb of this
class, of the measure فَعَلَ, should be
شَدُ3َ only, and
that of an intrans. verb of the same class and
measure should be
شَدِ3َ, and this is the only instance,
or almost the only one, of its kind, with both of
these forms of aor., except عَلَّ [and بَتَّ] and نَمَّ
الحَدِيثَ, but there is one trans. verb of the same
class having the latter form of aor. only, namely,
حَبَّ, (Fr, S, L,) inf. n. شَدٌّ, (L, Msb, K,) He
made it, or rendered it, hard; used in relation to
substances and attributes: (L:) he made, or rendered, it, or him, firm, compact, or sound; and
strong, powerful, or forcible; vigorous, robust, or
sturdy; syn. أَحْكَمَهُ, (L,) and قَوَّاهُ; (S, A, L, K; *)
as also ↓ شدّدهُ, [inf. n. تَشْدِيدٌ,] i. e. as syn. with
احكمهُ (L) and قوّاهُ: (S, A, L:) he bound, or tied,
him, or it, firmly, fast, or strongly; syn. أَوْثَقَهُ:
[which may also be meant to convey the signification immediately preceding this last:] (S, L,
Msb, K:) and [simply] he tied, bound, or made
fast, him, or it; syn. رَبَطَهُ. (S and Msb and K
&c. in art. ربط.) One says, شَدَّ عَضُدَهُ i. e. He
strengthened [his fore arm, or perhaps his upper
arm, but the former is app. here meant]. (S, L.)
And شَدَّ عَلَى يَدِهِ He strengthened him, [lit. his
arm, or hand,] and aided him. (L.) And شَدَّ
اللّٰهُ مُلْكَهُ, and ↓ شَدَّدَهُ, God strengthened, or may
God strengthen, his dominion. (S, L. [See also
a similar ex. voce أَزْرٌ.]) And شَدَّ العُقْدَةَ [He tied
firmly or fast or strongly, or he pulled tight, or
tightened, the knot], (A, Mgh, Msb,) and الوَثَاقَ
[the bond]. (Kur xlvii. 4.) [And شَدَّ الدَّابَّةَ He
bound the saddle on the beast: see an ex. voce
دَلِيلٌ.] شَدُّ الرِّحَالِ [lit. The binding of the camels'
saddles upon their backs] is a metonymical phrase
for (tropical:)  the going a journey. (Mgh, Msb.) And
شَدُّ المِئْزَرِ, occurring in a trad., [lit. The binding
of the waist-wrapper upon the waist] is a metonymical phrase for (tropical:)  the avoiding of women: or the
exerting oneself, or employing oneself vigorously
or laboriously, in work: or for both of these
together. (L.) مَا أَمْلِكُ شَدًّا وَلَا إِرْخَآءً [lit. I
possess not power to tighten nor to slacken] means
I am not able to do anything. (TA.) [And شَدَّهُ
also signifies He pressed, compressed, or squeezed,
it: and he pulled, or strained, it.] وَاشْدُدْ عَلَى
قُلُوبِهِمْ, in the Kur [x. 88], means And put Thou
a seal upon their hearts, so that they may not
heed admonition, nor be disposed, or directed, to
that which is good. (L.)
-A3-  أَشَدُّ لَقَدْ كَانَ كَذَا,
as also أَشَدُ without teshdeed, means أَشْهَدُ [q. v.]:
(K:) a strange saying. (TA.)

شَدَّ3َ see the preceding paragraph, latter half, in
two places. ―
-b2-  شدّدهُ, inf. n. تَشْدِيدٌ, also signifies
He made it, or rendered it, namely, a beating, and
anything, hard to be borne, heavy, vehement,
violent, intense, severe, strict, rigorous, or excessive; he intensified it, or aggravated it: (L:)
تَشْدِيدٌ is the contr. of تَخْفِيفٌ [in this sense and
in other senses here following]. (S.) [Hence, the
objective complement being understood,] one says,
شدّد عَلَيْهِ, (A, Msb,) which is the contr. of خَفَّفَ
[i. e. of خَفَّفَ عَنْهُ; thus meaning He rendered his
burden, suffering, distress, uneasiness, or the like,
hard to be borne, heavy, vehement, violent, intense,
severe, strict, rigorous, or excessive; intensified it,
or aggravated it; or he pressed hard upon him;
treated him with hardness, strictness, severity, or
rigour]: (Msb:) and مَنْ شَدَّدَ شَدَّدَ اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ
[Whoso treateth others hardly, God will treat
him hardly]. (A. [See also 8.]) ―
-b3-  [تَشْدِيدٌ, as
opposed to تَخْفِيفٌ, also signifies The characterizing of a letter by a lengthened pronunciation
equivalent in grammatical analysis and in prosody
to doubling, denoted in writing by the sign called
↓ شَدَّة, i. e. by the sign ّ over that letter; as also

Whoso contendeth for superiority in strength with
this religion, and withstandeth it, or opposeth it,
and tasketh himself with religious service beyond
his power, it (the religion) will overcome him: a
trad. (L.) And لَنْ يُشَادَّ الدِّينَ أَحَدٌ إِلَّا غُلِبَ No
one shall contend for superiority in strength with
religion, &c. but he will be overcome by the religion. (K, * TA.) ―

نَفْسَهُ; (L;) [فِى الشَّىْءِ in the thing; as also

signify the same: (S, L, K: * [see an ex. of
تشدّد in the first paragraph of art. جلد:]) [and]

[And شَدِيدٌ عَلَى كَذَا Niggardly, tenacious, or
avaricious, of such a thing.] Aboo-Dhu-eyb

حَدَرْنَاهُ بِالأَثْوَابِ فِى قَعْرِ هُوَّةٍ
شَدِيدٍ عَلَى مَا ضُمَّ فِى اللَّحْدِ جُولُهَا
[We lowered him, with the grave-clothes, into the
bottom of a cavity in the ground, the sides
whereof were tenacious of what was comprised in
the lateral hollow which was the place of the
corpse]. (L.) And the words of the Kur [c. 8],
وَإِنَّهُ لِحُبِّ الخَيْرِ لَشَدِيدٌ, accord. to Zj, mean And
verily, on account of the love of wealth, he is
niggardly, or tenacious, or avaricious. (L.)

العَيْنِ metaphorically applied by a poet to a she-camel, mean Whom sleep does not overcome.
(L.) And الشَّدِيدُ means The lion; (K;) because
of his strength and hardiness. (TA.) [شَدِيد
with a subst. or an inf. n. following it in the gen.
case, the latter having the article ال prefixed to
it, or being prefixed to another noun in the gen.
case, supplies the place of an intensive epithet; as in
شَدِيدُ السَّوَادِ Intensely, or very, black; and شَدِيدُ
الغَضَبِ Vehemently, or exceedingly, or very, angry;
and] مِسْكٌ شَدِيدُ الرَّائِحَةِ Strong-smelling musk;

by the affix ة]: see شِدَّةٌ.
أَشَدُّ [Possessing the quality of شِدَّة, in a greater,
and in the greatest, degree; i. e. more, and most,
hard, &c.]. See an ex. in a verse cited voce شِدَّةٌ.
حَلَبْتَ بِالسَّاعِدِ الأَشَدِّ, or حَلَبْتُهَا الخ, is a prov.,
expl. in art. حلب. And بَقِىَ أَشَدُّهُ. [The hardest
part of it has remained] is another prov., applied
to him who attains a part of that which he wants,
and is unable to attain the completion thereof.
(TA. [See also Freytag's “ Arab. Prov.,” i. 169.])
[With an indeterminate subst. or inf. n. following
it in the accus. case, it supplies the place of a
simple epithet denoting the comparative and
superlative degrees; as in أَشَدُّ سَوَادًا More, and
most, black; and أَشَدُّ غَضَبًا More, and most,
angry.] ―
-b2-  أَشَدُّ النَّهَارِ The time when the day is
most advanced, the sun being at the highest. (L.
[See شَدُّ النَّهَارِ.])
أَشُدٌّ, (S, A, Mgh, L, K, &c.,) also pronounced
أُشُدٌّ, (Seer, K,) but the latter form is rare, (TA,)
is both masc. and fem., (Zj, TA,) and as used in
the Kur it has somewhat different meanings: (Az,
TA:) in the phrase حَتَّى يَبْلُغَ أَشُدَّهُ, (S, K,) and
other phrases in the Kur, (TA,) أَشُدّ is expl. as
meaning The state of strength; (S, Mgh, L, K;)
which is from eighteen to thirty years: (S, L,
K:) or from about seventeen to forty: (Zj:) or
from thirty to forty: (Zj in another place:) or
puberty: (Az, Mgh, L:) or firmness, or soundness, of judgment, produced by experience: (L:)
or puberty together with such maturity as gives
evidence of rectitude of conduct or course of life;
(Zj, Az, Mgh, L;) which may be at, or before, the
age of eighteen years; accord. to most of the men of
science, and among them Esh-Sháfi'ee; (Zj, Az,
L;) and the extreme term of which is three and
thirty years: (Mgh:) or the age of forty years;
as in the Kur xlvi. 14: (L:) أَشُدٌّ [originally
أَشْدُدٌ] is a sing. having a pl. form, like آنُكٌ; and
these two words are [said to be] the only instances
of the kind: (S, K: [but see آنُكٌ:]) or a pl.
having no proper sing., (S, Mgh, K,) like
آسَالٌ and أَبَابِيلُ and عَبَادِيدُ and مَذَاكِيرُ: (S:) or
its sing. is ↓ شِدَّةٌ, (AHeyth, S, Mgh, K,) accord.
to Sb; and this is good with respect to the meaning, because one says, بَلَغَ الغُلَامُ شِدَّتَهُ; (S;) but
فِعْلَةٌ does not form a pl. of the measure أَفْعُلٌ;
(S, K;) for as to أَنْعُمٌ, (S,) which is said by
AHeyth to be pl. of نِعْمَةٌ, (TA,) [and respecting which Mtr says that] أَشُدٌّ is said to be pl.
of شِدَّةٌ like as أَنْعُمٌ is of نِعْمَةٌ, formed by regarding the ة as elided, (Mgh, [and AHeyth says the
like,]) it is only pl. of نُعْمٌ in the phrase يَوْمُ نُعْمٍ:
(S:) or its sing. is شَدٌّ, like as كَلْبٌ is of أَكْلُبٌ;
or شِدٌّ, like as ذِئْبٌ is of أَذْؤُبٌ; (S, K;) accord.
to some; (S;) but neither شَدٌّ nor شِدٌّ has been
heard from the Arabs [as sing. of أَشُدٌّ]; and they
are only deduced from analogy: (S, K:) or it is
pl. of أَشَدُّ; and the أ is not regarded in the formation of this pl. (IJ, from A 'Obeyd.)
مَشَدُّ العِصَابَةِ [The place, or part, where the
fillet, or the like, is bound, or tied]. (A.)
مُشِدٌّ A man having, (A, Mgh, L,) or having
with him, (L,) a strong beast, (A, Mgh, L,) or strong
beasts; (L;) contr. of مُضْعِفٌ. (Mgh, L.) It is
said in a trad., يَرُدُّ مُشِدُّهُمْ عَلَى مُضْعِفِهِمْ [He
among them who has a strong beast, or strong
beasts, shall give back a portion of the spoil to him
of them who has a weak beast, or weak beasts];
meaning that the strong warrior and plunderer
shall share with (يُسَاهِمُ) the weak in the plunder
that he gains. (L.)
مُتَشَدِّدٌ: see شَدِيدٌ.
