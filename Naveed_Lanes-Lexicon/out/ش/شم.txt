شم1
شَمِمْتُ, aor. أَشَمُّ; and شَمَمْتُ, aor. أَشُمُّ;
(S, Mgh, Msb, K;) the latter mentioned by AO;
(S, TA;) third pers. of each شَمَّ; (Mgh;) inf. n.
شَمُّ (S, Msb, K) and شَمِيمٌ, (S, K,) which are of
both verbs, (TA,) and شِمِّيمَى, mentioned by Z
(K, TA) alone; (TA;) I smelt, i. e. perceived
by the nose, (K,) a thing, (S, Msb, K, *) or an
odour; (Mgh;) and ↓ اِشْتَمَمْتُ signifies the same;
(S, Msb, K, TA; [اَشْمَمْتُهُ in the CK is a mistranscription for اِشْتَمَمْتُهُ;]) and ↓ تَشَمَّمْتُ also, (K,)
and ↓ شَمَّيْتُ, thus in the copies of the K, but
correctly ↓ شَمَّمْتُ: (TA: [both, however, are
mentioned in the CK: the former like قَصَّيْتُ for
قَصَّصْتُ:]) or الشَّىْءَ ↓ تَشَمَّمْتُ signifies شَمِمْتُهُ فِى
مُهْلَةٍ [I smelt the thing leisurely, or gently]: (S,
TA:) or الشَّىْءَ ↓ تشمّم and ↓ اشتمّهُ both signify
he put the thing near to his nose in order that he
might draw in its odour. (AHn, TA.) ―
-b2-  See an
ex. in a prov. mentioned voce خِمَارٌ. ―
-b3-  [Hence,]
شُمَّ (assumed tropical:)  He was tried, or proved by trial or experiment or experience; syn. اُخْتُبِرَ. (IAar, K.)
-A2-
شَمَّ, see. pers. شَمِمْتَ, aor. يَشَمُّ, (Msb,) inf. n. شَمَمٌ,
(S, * Msb, K, *) He (a man) was high, or elevated,
in the nose. (S, * Msb, K. *) ―
-b2-  [And hence,]
شَمَّ, (K,) [sec. pers. شَمِمْتَ,] inf. n. شَمَمٌ, (TA,)
(tropical:)  He (a man, TA) magnified himself; or behaved
proudly, or haughtily. (K, TA. [And اشمّ has a
similar meaning.]) ―
-b3-  [This verb is also probably
used in other senses, said of a mountain, &c.: see
شَمَمٌ below.] ―
-b4-  See also 4, near the end.
2
شَمَّمْتُ and
شَمَّيْتُ: see above, in two places.
3
شَامَّا, (K,) inf. n. مُشَامَّةٌ, (S, TA,) They smelt
each other; (S, * K;) as also ↓ تشامّا, (K,) inf. n.
تَشَامٌّ. (S.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] شَامِمْهُ (tropical:)  Look thou to see
what is with him, or in his mind, (مَا عِنْدَهُ, S, K,
TA,) and draw near to him, (K, TA,) and seek
after the knowledge of what is with him, or in
his mind, (ما عنده,) by means of informations and
disclosure; as though each smelt what was with
the other in order to act according thereto. (TA.)
And hence the saying, شَامَمْنَاهُمْ ثُمَّ نَاوَشْنَاهُمْ (tropical:)  [We
endeavoured, or looked, to ascertain their condition; then we engaged them in near, though not
close, conflict]. (TA.) You say also, شَامَمْتُ
الرَّجُلَ meaning [simply] (assumed tropical:)  I drew near to the
man. (S.) مُشَامَّةٌ [used tropically] signifies (assumed tropical:)  The
looking into a thing. (KL.) And (assumed tropical:)  The approaching the enemy so that the two parties see
each other. (S.)
4
اشمّهُ إِيَّاهُ He made him to smell it, or perceive
it by the nose. (K.) You say, أَشْمَمْتُهُ الطِيبَ [I
made him to smell the perfume]. (S, Msb.) ―
-b2-
And [hence] one says to the prefect, or governor,
or prince, or commander, أَشْمِمْنِى يَدَكَ أُقَبِّلْهَا
(assumed tropical:)  [Suffer me to approach thy hand that I may kiss
it]; (S, * TA;) a phrase like نَاوِلْنِى يَدَكَ, (TA,)
but better than the latter phrase: so says Kh. (S.)
―
-b3-  And اشمّ الخِتَانَ, and اشمّت البَظْرَ, (tropical:)  He, and
she, i. e. the operator, took, (K, TA,) or cut off,
(TA,) a small portion of the prepuce, and of the
بَظْر [q. v.]: (K, TA:) or the latter signifies she
cut off a portion of the نَوَاة [q. v.], not extirpating
it. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And اشمّ الحَرْفَ, (S, * K,) inf. n.
إِشْمَامٌ, (S,) (assumed tropical:)  He made the consonant to have a
smack of the dammeh or the kesreh, (lit., made it
to smell, S, or to taste, K, the dammeh or the
kesreh,) in such a manner (S, K) that the
إِشْمَام, (S,) or that the dammeh or kesreh, (K,)
was not heard, (S, K,) what is termed إِشْمَامُ
الحَرْفِ being less than what is termed رَوْمُ الحَرَكَةِ,
the former being apparent only by the motion of
the lip, (S,) or of the upper lip, (so in one of my
copies of the S,) no account being taken of it,
(S, K,) i. e. of the dammeh or kesreh, (K,) it not
being reckoned as a حَرَكَة because of its feebleness,
the consonant in this case being quiescent or like
that which is quiescent, (S,) and the prosodical
measure not being broken thereby: (K:) for ex.,
in the following verse,
مَتَى أَنَامُ لَا يُؤَرِّقْنِى الكَرِى
لَيْلًا وَلَا أَسْمَعُ أَجْرَاسَ المَطِى
[meaning الكَرِىّ and المَطِىّ, (as is said in one of my
copies of the S,) i. e. When I sleep, he who lets
beasts on hire will not render me wakeful by night,
nor do I hear the bells of the camels on which
people ride], the Arabs [or, as is said in the TA,
some of the Arabs] make the ق [in يؤرّقنى] to
have a smack of the dammeh; but if you took
account of the حَرَكَة of the إِشْمَام [in this case,]
the measure of the verse would be broken, [the
foot] رقنى الكرى becoming, in the scanning,
مُتَفَاعِلُنْ, which may be only in the كَامِل;
whereas this verse is of the رَجَز: (Sb, S:) another
case of إِشْمَام is that of the ى in دُوَيْبَّةٌ, [in which
that letter is quiescent, but made to have a smack
of kesreh,] as is the same letter in every similar
case, in a dim. noun, when followed by a doubled
letter. (Zj, T in art. دب.) Also He pronounced
the consonant with a حَرَكَة [or vowel-sound]
between damm and kesr, apparent only in utterance, not in writing; as in قِيلَ and غِيضَ in the
Kur xi. 46. (I 'Ak pp. 130 and 131.) [See also
رَوْمُ الحَرَكَةِ, voce رَامَ.] ―
-b5-  [Golius explains اشمّ as
signifying also “ Reduxit, fecit ut converteret se
ab aliqua re; ” as on the authority of the KL; in
my copy of which, however, I do not find this meaning.]
-A2-  اشمّ, (S, K,) inf. n. إِشْمَامٌ, [as an intrans.
verb,] said of a man, (S,) also signifies He passed
by, or along, raising his head; (S, K, TA;) and
magnified, or exalted, himself; behaved proudly,
or disdainfully; or elevated his nose, from pride.
(TA. [See also 1, near the end.]) ―
-b2-  And He
turned away from a thing. (K.) One says
بَيْنَا هُمْ فِى وَجْهٍ إِذْ أَشَمُّوا, i. e. [While they were in
a certain direction, lo,] they turned away; (S,
TA, as from AA;) or ↓ شَمُّوا. (Thus in one of my
copies of the S [but I think it to be a mistranscription].) And اشمّ القَوْمُ The people, or party,
deviated in their directions to the right and left:
a phrase heard in this sense by AA. (S.)

10
استشمّ He desired to smell. (KL.) ―
-b2-  And
He perceived a smell, or an odour, from a thing.
(KL.) ―
-b3-  دَخَلَ المُخَاطُ أَنْفَهُ فَأْسْتَشَمَّهُ فَأَدْخَلَهُ فِى
حَلْقِهِ, said of a man, means اِسْتَنْشَقَهُ [i. e. (tropical:)  The
mucus entered his nose, and he snuffed it up, and
made it to pass into his fauces]; the verb being
metaphorically thus used, like as الاِسْتِنْشَاقُ is
metaphorically used for الشَّمُّ. (Mgh.)
شَمَمٌ inf. n. of the intrans. verb شَمَّ [q. v.].
(Msb, TA.) ―
-b2-  [Used as a simple subst.,] Highness of the nose: (Msb:) or highness of the bone
of the nose, (S, K,) and beauty thereof, (K,) with
evenness, or straightness, of its upper part, (S, K,
when there is in it a gibbousness it is termed
قَنًا, S,) and uprightness of the end, or lowest part:
(K:) or, as some say, this last quality [alone]:
(TA:) or length of the end, or lower part, of the
nose, so that it extends over the middle of the
mustache, (وُرُودُ الأَرْنَبَةِ,) with beautiful evenness,
or straightness, of the bone, and highness thereof
greater than the highness that is termed ذَلَفٌ:
or length and slenderness of the nose, and a
downward extending of its رَوْثَة [i. e. end or tip,
or part where the blood that flows from the
nostrils drops or drips]: (K:) or [simply] length.
in the nose. (Ham p. 789.) ―
-b3-  And, in a man,
The quality of having what is termed شَمَمٌ of the
nose. (S.) ―
-b4-  [And hence, (tropical:)  Self-magnification,
or pride, or haughtiness: see 1, near the end.] ―
-b5-
And (tropical:)  Generosity. (Ham p. 728.) ―
-b6-  Also Highness, (K,) or tallness of the head, (S,) of a
mountain. (S, K.) ―
-b7-  And (tropical:)  Nearness: and
(tropical:)  remoteness: thus having two contr. meanings.
(K, TA.) It has both of such meanings in the
phrase دَارُهُ شَمَمٌ (tropical:)  [His house, or abode, is near:
and, remote]: (K, TA:) and in the phrase
رَأَيْتُهُ مِنْ شَمَمٍ (tropical:)  [I saw him, or it, from within
a short distance: and, from afar]. (TA.)
شَمُومٌ A thing [odorous, fragrant, or] fit to be
smelt. (KL.)
شَمِيمٌ High, or elevated: (S, K:) applied in
this sense to a [camel's saddle such as is called]
قَتَب. (S.)
شَمَّامٌ A sort of melon resembling a small
colocynth, [or rather a small melon resembling a
colocynth,] streaked with redness and greenness and
yellowness: called in Pers. دَسْتَنْبُويَه [i. e. “ perfume ”]; (K;) originally دَسْتْ بُوى [or دَسْتْ
بُويَهْ]: (TA:) its odour is cool, pleasant, lenitive,
and narcotic; and the eating of it is laxative to
the bowels: (K:) [The cucumis dudaïm of Linn.;
called by Forskål cucumis schemmam: the latter
thus describes it (Flora Aegypt. Arab. p. 169):
“ Caules 5-sulcati, setis rigidis, scandentes,
cirrhosi: folia cordato-oblonga, acuta, subsinuata,
dentato-repanda, hispida: calyces villosi, molles:
flores flavi, conferti in alis: fructus globosoovatus, glaberrimus, magnitudine citri, flavus,
maculis inæqualibus, fulvo-ferrugineis, versus
polos in lineas confluentibus; pulpa aquosa,
seminibus tota plena: fructus juvenis villosus;
maturus glaber: odor, fortis nec ingratus; eamque
ob caussam cultus; non edulis: ” in the present
day, the same appellation is applied in Egypt to
several species of melon, of pleasant odour and
taste; but this application I believe to be of very
late origin: see also لُفَّاحٌ: and see De Sacy's
“ Rel. de l'Égypte par Abd-allatif,” pp. 126-7.]
شَمَّامَاتٌ Sweet odours that one smells. (K.)
شَمَاشِمُ Ripe dates remaining upon the raceme.
(AZ, K.)
[
شَامٌّ Smelling, or perceiving by the nose.] ―
-b2-

وَذْرَة] is an expression of reproach. (S.)
أَشَمُّ, applied to a man, (Msb,) Having that
quality of the nose which is termed شَمَمٌ; (Msb,
K;) or so أَشَمُّ الأَنْفِ, thus applied: (S:) fem.
شَمَّآءُ: (Msb, TA:) and pl. شُمٌّ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And
[hence, (tropical:)  Self-magnifying, or proud, or haughty:
or] a chief characterized by disdainfulness, scornfulness, or disdainful and proud incompliance,
(K, TA,) and high-minded. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Also A
mountain tall, (S, TA,) or high, (TA,) in the
head. (S, TA.) [And High, as applied to a place
of ascent in a mountain: see an ex. of the pl. in a
verse cited voce تَصَدَّفَ.] ―
-b4-  And A shoulder
high in the head of its bone. (K.) ―
-b5-  [Freytag

[and] fem. شَمَّاء Jugum extensum in monte: ”
from the Deewán of the Hudhalees.]
مُشِمٌّ [Turning away, or averse]. One says,

to him such a thing, and lo, he was averse, not
desiring it]. (S.)
[
مِشَمٌّ An instrument of smelling; like as مِسْمَعٌ
signifies “ an instrument of hearing. ” ―
-b2-  Hence,
its pl.] مَشَامُّ signifies Noses. (KL.) ―
-b3-  [This pl.
is expl. by Jac. Schultens, as meaning Perfumes
(odoramenta): so says Freytag.]
مَشْمُومٌ A thing that is smelt; such as any
sweet-smelling plant: like as مَأْكُولٌ signifies “ a
thing that is eaten: ” (Msb:) [and] musk: (S,
K:) [pl. مَشْمُومَاتٌ.]
