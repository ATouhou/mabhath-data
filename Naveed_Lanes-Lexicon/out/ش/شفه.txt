شفه1
شَفَهَهُ, aor.
شَفَهَ, (K,) inf. n. شَفْهٌ, (TK,) He
struck his شَفَة [i. e. lip]. (K.) ―
-b2-  شُفِهَ, [said of
a water, (assumed tropical:)  It had many lips of drinkers applied
to it; i. e. it had many drinkers: (see its part. n.:)
and] said of food, (tropical:)  It had many eaters: (K, TA:)
or [as a consequence thereof] it became little in
quantity. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And [hence], said of property,
(assumed tropical:)  It had many seekers. (K.) ―
-b4-  And, said of a
man, (assumed tropical:)  He had many askers, or beggars, (K,
TA,) so that they consumed what he had, or
possessed. (TA.) [Or (assumed tropical:)  He was importuned by
begging, so that what he had, or possessed, was
consumed: as pass. of what next follows.] ―
-b5-
شَفَهَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He importuned him by begging, so that he

And one says, كَادَ العِيَالُ يَشْفَهُونَ مَالِى (tropical:)  The
family, or household, almost consumed my property. (K, * TA.) ―
-b6-  Also, (S, K,) inf. n. شَفْهٌ,
(S,) i. q. شَغَلَ. (S, K.) You say, شَفَهَنِى عَنْ كَذَا
(assumed tropical:)  He, or it, occupied me so as to divert me from
such a thing; syn. شَغَلَنِى. (S.) And نَحْنُ
نَشْفَهُ عَلَيْكَ المَرْتَعَ, and المَآءَ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  We
occupy the place of pasturage so as to keep it
from thee, and the water, (نَشْغَلُهُ عَنْكَ,) i. e. it is
sufficient for us without being more than sufficient.
(S, TA.) And شُفِهَ عَنْكَ مَا عِنْدَنَا (assumed tropical:)  What we
had was employed so as to be kept from thee;
syn. شُغِلَ عَنْكَ. (JK.)
-A2-  IAar mentions the
phrase شَفَهْتُ نَصِيبِى, with fet-h, without explaining it; but Th says that it is سفهت, [i. e.
سَفِهْتُ, with س, and with kesr to the ف,] meaning
“ I forgot [my share, or portion]. ” (TA.)
3
شافههُ, (K,) inf. n. مُشَافَهَةٌ, (TA,) He put
his lip (شَفَتَهُ) near to his [another's] lip. (K,
TA.) And كَلَّمَهُ مُشَافَهَةً (Msb, TA) and مُشَافَاةً
(Msb) He spoke to him putting his lip near to
his lip: (TA:) [or mouth to mouth; for,] accord.
to J, (TA,) مُشَافَهَةٌ signifies the talking with
another mouth to mouth: (S, TA:) but the usage
of the inf. n. of a verb different from that which
it is thus made to qualify is, as Sb says, restricted to instances that have been heard: the
phrase كَلَّمَهُ مُفَاوَهَةً [has not been heard, and
therefore] is not allowable. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,]
شافه البَلَدَ, and الأَمْرَ, (tropical:)  He was, or became, or
drew, near to the town, or country, and the affair.
(A, K, TA.)
شَفَةٌ, (T, S, Msb, K, &c.,) also pronounced
↓ شِفَةٌ, (K,) is a word of which the third, i. e. the
final, radical letter is elided; (T, Msb;) and
accord. to some, (Msb,) this letter is ه, (T, Msb,
K, TA,) so accord. to all of the Basrees, (TA,)
the word being originally ↓ شفهة, (T, S, Msb, TA,)
i. e. شَفَهَةٌ, (so in copies of the S,) or شَفْهَةٌ, like
كَلْبَهٌ and سَجْدَةٌ, (Msb,) because it has the
former of the dims. mentioned below, and the
first of the pls. mentioned below, with ه, (S,
Msb, *) and it is sometimes pronounced شفهة;
(T, TA;) or, as some assert, the deficient letter is
و, (S, Msb,) the word being originally شَفْوَةٌ, like
شَهْوَةٌ, (Msb,) because it has the last of the pls.
mentioned below, (S, [but omitted in one of my
copies,] and Msb, *) and the latter of the two
dims. mentioned below; (Msb;) both of which
assertions are stated on the authority of Kh; (IF,
Msb;) [The lip of a human being;] شَفَتَا الإِنْسَانِ
meaning the two covers of the mouth of the
human being: (K:) it is [properly] only of a
human being: (Msb:) but it is sometimes, metaphorically, of the horse: and in like manner, of
the دَلْو [or leathern bucket] as used by A'Obeyd;
but ISd has expressed a doubt whether he had
heard this from the Arabs: (TA:) the pl. is شِفَاهٌ
(S, Msb, K, &c.) and شَفَهَاتٌ (Lth, Msb, TA) and
شَفَوَاتٌ, (Lth, S, Msb, K,) the second of which is
said by Lth to be more agreeable with analogy
than the third, though the third is more common,
as being likened to سَنَوَاتٌ [pl. of سَنَةٌ]: (Az,
(Msb, TA:) and Ks mentions the phrase, إِنَّهُ
لَغَلِيظُ الشِفَاهِ [as meaning Verily he is thick in the
lip], as though the term شَفَةٌ applied to every
portion of the شَفَة: (TA:) the dim. is ↓ شُفَيْهَةُ
(S, Msb) and شُفَيَّةٌ. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] هُمْ أَهْلُ
الشَّفَةِ (assumed tropical:)  They are those who have the right of
drinking with their lips (بِشِفَاهِهِمْ) and of watering
their beasts. (Mgh.) ―
-b3-  And بِنْتُ شَفَةٍ (tropical:)  A word;
(S, Msb, K, TA;) as also ذَاتُ شَفَةٍ. (TA.) One
says, مَا كَلَّمْتُهُ بِبِنْتِ شَفَةٍ (assumed tropical:)  I spoke not to him a
word: (S:) or مَا كَلَّمَنِىبِنْتَ شَفَةٍ (assumed tropical:)  He spoke
not to me a word: (TA:) and مَا سَمِعْتُ مِنْهُ بِنْتَ شَفَةٍ
(assumed tropical:)  I heard not from him a word: (Msb:) and
مَا كَلَّمْتُ فُلَانًا ذَاتَ شَفَةٍ (assumed tropical:)  I spoke not to such
a one a word. (AZ, T voce ذُو.) ―
-b4-  And فُلَانٌ
خَفِيفُ الشَّفَةِ (tropical:)  Such a one is a person who asks, or
begs, little of people: (ISk, S, K, * TA:) and also,
(tropical:)  importunate, (K, TA,) one who asks, or begs,
much of people: (TA:) thus having two contr.
meanings. (K.) ―
-b5-  And لَهُ فِى النَّاسِ شَفَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  He
has praise, or commendation, among the people:
(S:) and لَهُ فِينَا شَفَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ (tropical:)  He has a good report,
or reputation, among us. (A, K, TA.) And
إِنَّ شَفَةَ النَّاسِ عَلَيْكَ لَحَسَنَةٌ (tropical:)  Verily the people's
speaking of thee is good. (Lh, TA.) And مَا
أَحْسَنَ شَفَةَ النَّاسِ عَلَيْكَ (tropical:)  How good is the people's
speaking of thee! (K, TA.) ―
-b6-  See also شَفًا, in
art. شفو and شفى.
شِفَةٌ, and see the next preceding paragraph.
شَفَهَةٌ or شَفْهَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
شَفَهِىٌّ and شَفِىٌّ are both allowable as rel. ns. of
شَفَةٌ [i. e. as meaning Labial: and so, accord. to
some, is شَفَوِىٌّ]. (S.) الحُرُوفُ الشَّفَهِيَّةُ (Kh, T,
S, Msb, K) and الشَّفَوِيَّةُ, (Kh, T, Msb,) or the
latter is not allowable, (S,) [i. e. The labial
letters,] are ب and ف and م: (T, S, K:) [or,
accord. to Lumsden (Ar. Gr. p. 28), ب and م
and و: and, it seems, accord. to some, (see De
Sacy's Gr. Ar. sec. ed. i. 27,) ج and ش and ض,
which is strange:] so called because their place of
utterance is from the شَفَة, without any action of
the tongue. (T, TA.)
شُفَيْهَةٌ: dim. of شَفَةٌ, q. v.
شُفَاهِىٌّ A man (S, Mgh) large [in some copies
of the S thick] in the شَفَتَانِ [or lips]; (S, Mgh,
K;) as also ↓ أَشْفَهُ. (Mgh. [But see this latter
below.])
شَافِهٌ Thirsty, (K, TA,) not finding water
enough to moisten his lip: like سَافِهٌ, mentioned in
art. سفه. (TA.)
أَشْفَهُ: see شُفَاهِىٌّ. ―
-b2-  [Accord. to some,] أَشْفَى
signifies A man whose lips do not close together:
(S, K:) but there is no proof of its correctness:
(S:) the fem. in this sense is شَفْيَآءُ. (TA in art.
شفى.)
مَشْفُوهٌ (tropical:)  A water at which there are many lips
(شِفَاه TA, and Har p. 669,) of those coming to
drink, (Har,) so that it has become little in quantity; (TA;) or water at which are many people:
(S, K: *) or water that is sought: or, as some say,
forbidden to those who come to drink of it because
of its being little in quantity. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And
hence, (Har ubi suprà,) (tropical:)  Food upon which are
[put] many hands; (K, TA, Har;) having many
eaters: or that has become little in quantity.
(TA.) ―
-b3-  And (assumed tropical:)  Property sought by many: (TA:)
[or little in quantity; for] one says, أَتَانَا وَ أَمْوَالُنَا
مَشْفُوهَةٌ (tropical:)  He came to us when our possessions
were little in quantity. (K, TA.) ―
-b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  A
man of whom people have asked, or begged, much,
(S,) or importuned by begging, (K,) so that all
that he had, or possessed, is consumed: (S, K:)
like مَثْمُودٌ, and مَضْفُوفٌ, and مَكْثُورٌ عَلَيْهِ: (so in
one of my copies of the S:) and sometimes it
means (assumed tropical:)  one whose household and guests have
consumed his property. (IB, TA.)

or he, appeared, or became apparent. (K.)
-A2-  شَفَاهُ, (S, Msb, K,) aor.
1َ2ِ3َ, (Msb, K,) inf. n.
شِفَآءٌ, (S, Msb,) He (God, S, Msb) recovered

أَبْرَأَهُ, so in the M, but in the K بَرَاهُ, (TA,)
namely a sick person, (Msb,) مِنْ مَرَضِهِ [from
his disease, or sickness]. (S, TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,
شَفَيْتُهُ, in art. بضع in the S, said by a person
respecting one who asked him concerning a
question, as meaning (assumed tropical:)  I relieved him from doubt:
and شَفَاهُ عَنِ المَسْأَلَةِ in the same art. in the K, as

gain of such a one (ما being here what is termed
مَصْدَرِيَّة, as اِزْدَادَ and رَبِحَ are intrans.,) is more
excellent than thy gain] is said to be an instance
of substitution, [originally شَفَّفَ and شَفَّفْتَ,] like
[قَصَّى and تَقَصَّى and] تَقَضَّى [for قَصَّصَ and
تَقَصَّصَ and تَقَضَّضَ]. (TA.)
3
مُشَافَاةٌ [an inf. n. of which the verb, if used,
is شَافَى]: see 3 in art. شفه.
4
اشفى عَلَيْهِ He was, or became, on the brink

be on the brink of destruction]. (TA ibid.)
-A3-
اشفاهُ He gave him a remedial medicine. (Az,
TA.) And He prescribed for him a remedy in
which should be his recovery, or restoration to
convalescence. (TA.) And أَشْفَيْتُكَ الشَّىْءَ (S, K *)
I gave thee the thing in order that thou shouldst
attain, or seek, recovery, or restoration to convalescence, thereby. (S: in two copies thereof,
بِهِ ↓ تَشْتَفِى: in two other copies thereof, and in
like manner in the K, بِهِ ↓ تَسْتَشْفِى.) And اشفاهُ
اللّٰهُ عَسَلًا God made honey to be his remedy.

-b2-  See also 1, last sentence. ―

also signifies (assumed tropical:)  He gave [a person] something.

his enemy [or the enemy] in a manner that rejoiced him [or relieved him from his anger]: (T,
TA:) [or he attained what he desired from his
enemy or the enemy, and so appeased his anger:]
because latent anger is like a disease; and when
it departs by reason of that which one seeks to
obtain from his enemy, he is as though he became
free, or recovered, from his disease. (Msb.)
6
تَشَافَيْتُ المَآءَ a phrase mentioned by IAar as
meaning I exhausted the water: said by ISd to
be originally تَشَافَفْتُ. (TA in art. شف.)
8
اشتفى بِكَذَا (S, K, TA) He attained recovery, or restoration to convalescence, by means
of such a thing: (TA;) and so ↓ تشفّى: (TK:)
and مِنْ عِلَّتِهِ ↓ استشفى [if not a mistranscription
for اشتفى] he became free from his disease, sickness, or malady; recovered from it; or became
convalescent. (TA.) See 4, latter part. ―

see also 5. ―
-b3-  [Also (assumed tropical:)  He was, or became, content
with such a thing; or relieved from doubt thereby:

شَفًا The point or extremity, verge, brink, or
edge, of anything; (S, Msb, K, &c.;) like ↓ شَفَةٌ;
for شَفَا الحُفْرَةِ (Ksh in iii. 99) or شَفَا البِئْرِ (Bd
ibid.) and شَفَتُهَا both signify the same, (Ksh, Bd,)
i. e. حَرْفُهَا (Ksh) or طَرَفُهَا; (Bd;) but the final و
in the former is changed into ا, and in the latter
[accord. to those who hold شَفَةٌ to be originally
شَفْوَةٌ] it is elided; (Ksh, Bd;) شَفًا being originally
شَفَوٌ: (Bd:) [but شَفًا generally signifies as expl.
above; and شَفَةٌ almost always signifies the “ lip ”
of a human being:] the dual is شَفَوَانِ; this being
known, as Akh says, by the fact that إِمَالَة in the
word شَفًا is not allowable: (S:) and the pl. is
أَشْفَآءٌ. (TA.) It is said in the Kur [iii. 99],
وَكُنْتُمْ عَلَى شَفَا حُفْرَةٌ مِنَ النَّارِ فَأَنْقَذَكُمْ مِنْهَا [And
ye were on the verge, or brink, of a pit of the fire
of Hell, and He saved, or rescued, you from it].

on the brink of destruction]. (TA.) ―

sight (البَصَر), and of the day, and the like, as in
the T. (TA.) One says of a man on the occasion of
his dying, and of the moon at [the last period of the
month called] its مُحَاق, and of the sun at its
setting, (S,) مَا بَقِىَ مِنْهُ إِلَّا شَفًا [and مِنْهَا when
said of the sun] (assumed tropical:)  There has not remained of him,
or it, save a little: (S, K: *) and [in like manner]
مِنَ العُمُرِ [of life]. (S.) And one says, أَتَيْتُهُ
بِشَفًا مِنْ ضَوْءِ الشَّمْسِ (assumed tropical:)  [I came to him in a time
when there was little remaining of the light of the
sun]. (TA.) El-'Ajjáj says,
أَشْرَفْتُهُ بِلَا شَفًا أَوْ بِشَفَا  وَمِرْبَأٍ عَالٍ لِمَنٌ تَشَرَّفَا
meaning [Many an elevated place of observation,
high to him who ascends it, I have ascended]
when the sun had set or when there was somewhat
of it remaining. (S.) One says also, صَارَ فِى شَفَا
القَمَرِ meaning (assumed tropical:)  He was, or became, in the last
part of the night. (TA.) And it is said in a trad.,
(in relation to [the temporary marriage termed]
المُتْعَة,) فَلَوْ لَا نَهْيُهُ عَنْهَا مَا احْتَاجَ إِلَى الزِّنَا إِلَّا شَفًا,
accord. to the T meaning [Were it not for his
(i. e. God's) forbidding it, none would need having
recourse to fornication,] save a small number of
men: (T, TA:) or, accord. to 'Atà, it means, but
would be on the brink thereof, without falling
into it; شَفًا being thus used in the place of the
inf. n. إِشْفَآء: so says IAth, as from Az. (TA.)
شَفَةٌ, in which the deficient letter is و, (K, TA,)
for it has for pl. شَفَوَاتٌ, (TA,) or ه, (K, TA,)
for it has [also] for pl. شِفَاهٌ, (TA,) has been
mentioned before, (K, TA,) in art. شفه [q. v.].
(TA.) ―
-b2-  See also شَفًا above, first sentence.
شِفَآءٌ, (K, TA,) like كِسَآءٌ, (TA,) [in the CK
erroneously written شَفاء,] primarily signifies The
becoming free from disease, sickness, or malady;
recovering therefrom; or becoming convalescent:
―
-b2-  and then, Medical, or curative, treatment:

شُفَيَّةٌ: see art. شفه.
شَفَوِىٌّ: see art. شفه.
شَافٍ [Recovering, or restoring to convalescence;
remedial;] health-giving. (KL.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,
جَوَابٌ شَافٍ (assumed tropical:)  An answer that relieves from doubt.]
أَشْفَى More [and most remedial or] healthgiving. (KL.)
-A2-  Also A man whose lips do not
close together: fem. شَفْيَآءُ. (TA.) See أَشْفَهُ, in
art. شفه.
إِشْفًى An instrument for perforating; (K;) a
thing pertaining to the makers or sewers of boots
or shoes or sandals &c.; (S;) [i. e.] the awl used
by them: (MA, KL:) and the instrument with
which leather, or skin, is sewed: (Mgh, K:) or,
accord. to ISk, it is [an instrument used] for
water-skins and water-bags and the like; and the
مِخْصَف is for sandals: (S:) [see also art. اشف:]
masc. and fem.: (K, * TA:) pl. أَشَافٍ. (Mgh,
TA.) ―
-b2-  Th mentions the saying, إِنْ لَاطَمْتَهُ

-b3-  And إِشْفَى المِرْفَقِ, a phrase used
by a poet, means (assumed tropical:)  Sharp in the elbow. (TA.)
