-b2-  (tropical:)  Tall; (S, A;) as also
↓ شَوْذَبٌ; (S;) the former as an epithet applied to
a horse, (S, A,) from the same epithet as applied
to a palm-trunk: (A:) and (assumed tropical:)  tall, and goodly in
make; (A, K;) and so ↓ شَوْذَبٌ; (Mgh, K;) as
though pruned: (Mgh:) and ↓ the latter, applied
to anything [meaning any animal], (assumed tropical:)  tall, and excellent or of high breed or strong and light and
swift: A 'Obeyd says that the former signifies
(assumed tropical:)  excessively tall, and is applied in this sense to
anything [i. e. a man and any animal]: Kt says,
after explaining شَذَّبْتُ المَالَ as it has been expl.
above, that he who is excessively tall is as though
his frame were disconnected, and not compact;
and therefore he is thus termed: but IAmb says
that Kt has made a mistake in asserting that this
epithet signifies (assumed tropical:)  tall, conspicuous for tallness,
and that it is from the palm-tree from which the
branches have been lopped off, (in consequence of
which, as is said in the Fáïk, it becomes taller,
MF, TA,) and that he who is (assumed tropical:)  conspicuous for
tallness is not thus called unless somewhat deficient in flesh: it is applied to a horse as meaning
(tropical:)  tall, and not very fleshy. (TA.)
