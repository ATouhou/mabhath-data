تشّبث بِهِ He, or it, clung, caught, clave, or
adhered, to it, (S, A, L, Msb, K, * TA,) namely,
a thing; (S, L, TA;) as also ↓ شَبِثَ بِهِ, aor.
شَبَثَ,
inf. n. شَبَثٌ: (L, TA:) or, accord. to Esh-Shiháb,
in the Expos. of the Shifè, to a thing in which
was weakness: or, accord. to the 'Ináyeh, he, or
it, clung, &c., to it with weakness; and therefore
↓ مُتَشَبِّثٌ is used as an epithet applied to a spider;
and تَمَسُّكَ signifies a stronger action; and تشبّث
به is also expl. as meaning he, or it, took fast, or
firm, hold upon it: (L, TA:) and he stuck, or
fixed, or struck, the claw, or talons, or nails,
into it: (MA, PS:) and الشَّىْءَ ↓ شَبِثَ he laid
hold upon the thing, and took it: IAar was
asked respecting some verses, and he said, مَا
أَدْرِى مِنْ أَيْنَ شَبِثْتُهَا I know not whence I laid
hold upon them [and took them]. (L, TA.)
Q. Q. 1
accord. to the S and L, شَنْبَثَ: see
art. شنبث.
شَبَثٌ The spider: (K:) or a large spider,
with many legs. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also (K) A certain
small creeping thing, (S, A, Msb, K,) having
many legs, (S, A, K,) of the أَحْنَاش [or creeping
things &c.] of the earth: (S, Msb:) it should not
be called شِبْثٌ: (S:) or a certain small creeping
thing, having six long legs, yellow in the back,
and in the outer sides of the legs, black in the
head, and blue in the eye: or a certain small
creeping thing, having many legs, large in the
head, of the احناش of the earth: or a certain
small creeping thing, wide in the mouth, high in
the hinder part, that perforates the ground, is
found where there is moisture, and eats scorpions; and it is what is called شَحْمَةُ الأَرْضِ:
(TA:) pl. شِبْثَانٌ. (S, A, Msb, K.) The [marks
termed] أَثْر of the blade of a sword are likened by
a poet, (S, TA,) namely, Sá'ideh Ibn-Ju-eiyeh,
(TA,) to the tracks of شِبْثَان. (S, TA.)
رَجُلٌ شَبِثٌ A man whose nature it is to cling,
catch, cleave, or adhere, to a thing. (S, K.) And
ضِرْسٌ ضَبِثٌ شَبِثٌ [A tooth, or molar tooth,] that
catches, or fastens, to a thing. (TA.)
شُبَثَةٌ, (K,) or شُبَثَةٌ ضُبَثَةٌ, (TA,) A man (TA)
who cleaves to his قِرْن [i. e. opponent, or adversary], not quitting him. (K, TA.)
شِبِثٌّ [erroneously written in some copies of the
K شِبْثٌ, and in the L شِبِثٌ,] A certain wellknown plant; (AHn, L, Msb;) a certain herb,
or leguminous plant; (K;) [i. q. شِبِتٌّ and سِبِتٌّ,
q. v.; i. e. anethum graveolens, or dill, of the
common garden-species:] Sgh says that شبث is a
foreign word of which سِبِتٌّ is an arabicized form;
and it is made of the measure فِعِلٌّ because this
measure has many examples; whereas the measure فِعِلٌّ, of which إِبِلٌ is an instance, is extraordinary. (Msb.)
شَبَّاثٌ: see what next follows.
شَبُّوثٌ and ↓ شَبَّاثٌ [so in the CK and in my
MS. copy of the K, but the latter is strangely
said in the TA to be with kesr,] sings. of شَبَابِيثُ,
which signifies The flesh-hooks (كَلَالِيب) of the
fire. (K.)
الشَّنْبَثُ: see art. شنبث.
الشُّنَابِثُ: see art. شنبث.
مِتَشَبِّثٌ an epithet applied to a spider: see 5.
