i. e. the small bone called الشَّظَى, (As, S, Mgh, *)
moved from its place, (As, S, Mgh,) or became
displaced, syn. زُوِىَ, (A, TA,) or became unsteady, or wabbling: (K:) and so ↓ تشظّى, (K,
TA,) this latter on the authority of ISd: (TA:)
or [the inf. n.] شَظًى, accord. to some, signifies
the sinews' becoming split, or slit: (As, S, Mgh:)
or شَظًى has this meaning also; (K;) and so
↓ تَشَظّ. (ISd, K, TA.)
-A2-  Accord. to the K,
شَظِىَ, said of a corpse, is syn. with شَصِىَ: but
correctly, the former verb is شَظَى, aor.
شَظِىَ, inf. n.
شُظِىٌّ, and the latter verb is شَصَا [q. v.], as they
are said to be by Az: and in like manner, شَظِى,
aor.

milk], meaning It being filled, its legs became
raised, or raised high. (TA.)

4
اشظاهُ He, or it, hit, or hurt, his شظى
(شَظَاهُ): (K:) Sgh says, by rule it should be
شَظَاهُ [i. e. the verb should be thus, being derived
from الشَّظَى, like قَفَاهُ from القَفَا]. (TA.)
5

so in my copy of the Mgh,]) or a slender small
bone, (As, S,) adhering to the ذِرَاع [here app.
meaning the arm-bone of a horse], (As, S, K,) or
to the bone of the ذِرَاع, (Mgh,) which sometimes
moves from its place; (As, S, Mgh; [see شَظِيَّةٌ;])
or to the knee; (K;) thus in the M; (TA;) or to
the وَظِيف [app. here meaning the fore shank of a
horse]; (K;) thus in the A: (TA:) or certain
small sinews (عَصَب) therein; (K;) i. e. in the
وظيف; thus in the T. (TA.) AO says that
تَحَرُّكُ الشَّظَى [i. e. The motion of the شظى from
its place (see 1)] is like what is termed اِنْتِشَارُ
العَصَبِ, except that the horse has more power of

such as reaches the utmost extent thereof: (K,
accord. to the TA: [الشَّظَى being there expl. by
the words الوبرة على اثر الدبرة حتى تبلغ اقصاها:
in the CK, and in my MS. copy of the K, الدَّبَرَةُ
على أَثَرِ الدَّبَرَةِ فى المَزْرَعَةِ حَتَّى تَبْلُغَ أَقْصَاهَا;
which Freytag renders “ sulcus ad latus alterius
in arvo ductus, ut ejus extremum attingeret; ”
but which, I think, evidently presents a mistranscription and an interpolation:]) the pl. is
أَشْظِيَةٌ: and sometimes there are ten [?] portions
of fur [of this description, app. meaning, upon one
camel: the word that I here render “ ten ” is
more like عشه than عشر; but the final letter, as is
often the case in the MS. of the TA, is written in
a form differing little from a common form of ر]:
mentioned by ISh, from Et-Táïfee; as is said in
the T. (TA.) ―
-b5-  Also (assumed tropical:)  The followers, and incorporated confederates, of a people, or party;
(S, K;) contr. of the صَمِيم thereof: (S:) or the

شِظِيَّةٌ A splinter, or piece split off, (T, S, M,

(S,) or of wood, (T, Mgh, Msb,) and the like,
(Msb,) or of a reed, or cane, (T, Mgh,) or of
silver, (T, TA,) or of bone, (T, Mgh,) or of anything: (M, K:) pl. شَظَايَا (S, Msb, K, &c.) and
↓ شَظِىٌّ, (K,) [or rather this is a coll. gen. n.,] like
as رَكِىٌّ is of رَكِيَّةٌ, (TA,) or a quasi-pl. n., like
عَبِيدٌ, improperly said by IAar to be pl. of شَظًى,
(ISd, TA,) and ↓ شِظِىٌّ, (K, TA, [in the latter
as omitted in the K, with kesr to the ش on
account of the same vowel-sound following,])
mentioned by Sgh, from Ks. (TA.) AO terms
the إِبْرَة [q. v.] at the head of the elbow [of
the horse] a شَظِيَّة adhering to the ذِرَاع, but not
[forming a portion] of it. (TA. [See شَظًى.]) ―

the authority of AHn. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And The shankbone. (K.) ―
-b4-  And A great mass of rock wrenched
from the side of a mountain; (K, TA;) as though
it were a piece split off, broken [off] but not
parted so as to form an interstice, or a gap: and
also a piece cut from a mountain, like a house or
a tent: and it is said in the copies of the K that
شِظْيَةٌ, with kesr, signifies the same; but the word
is correctly ↓ شِنْظِيَةٌ, with an augmentative ن as
in the T, and mentioned also by Hr in the
“ Ghareebeyn: ” pl. of the former شَظَايَا. (TA.)
―
-b5-  See also شَنْظَاةٌ.

TA,) [and so ↓ شَظِيَّةٌ, (Freytag, from the Deewán
of the Hudhalees,)] resembling the شُرْفَة [q. v.]
of a mosque: pl. شَنَاظٍ: and الجِبَالِ ↓ شَوَاظِى
[likewise] signifies the heads, or tops, of the
mountains. (TA.)
شِنْظِيَةٌ: see شَظِيَّةٌ, near the end.
شَوَاظِى الجِبَالِ: see شَنْظَاةٌ.
[
مَشْظًى, pl. مَشَاظِى, A fragment of wood:
