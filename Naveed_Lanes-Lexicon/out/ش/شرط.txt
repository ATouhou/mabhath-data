شَرْطٌ [A condition; a term; a stipulation; said
to signify] the imposition of a thing as obligatory
[upon a person], and the taking it upon oneself as
such, in a sale and the like; (K;) [but this is a
loose explanation, as is observed in the TK; the
meaning being a thing imposed upon a person as
obligatory, and taken upon oneself as such: in the
S, it is merely said to be well known:] and
↓ شَرِيطَةٌ signifies the same: (S, Msb, K:) pl. of
the former, شُرُوطٌ: (S, Msb, K:) and of the latter,
شَرَائِطُ. (Msb, TA.) It is said in a trad., لَا يَجُوزُ
شَرْطَانِ فِى بَيْعٍ [Two conditions in a sale are not
allowable]; as when one says, “I sell to thee this
garment, or piece of cloth, for ready money for a

[whether it be against thee or in thy favour:]
(Mgh in art. ملك:) relating to the keeping of

like: for instance, you say, شَرْطُ المَصْدَرِ كَذَا وَكَذَا,

thing.]

which men appoint between them; (TA;) as also
↓ شَرْطٌ: (TA:) pl. of the former, أَشْرَاطٌ. (Msb,
K.) And hence, (Msb,) أَشْرَاطُ السَّاعَةِ The signs
of the resurrection, or of the time thereof; (S,
Msb, TA;) mentioned in the Kur [xlvii. 20]: or
the small events prior thereto, which men deny:

of the main circumstances thereof, and of the
event itself. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence also,] الشَّرَطَانِ The
two stars [a and b] which are the two horns of
Aries; (S, K, Kzw;) the brighter whereof is
called النَّاطِحُ; (Kzw;) [and the other, النَّطْحُ;]
the First Mansion of the Moon: (Kzw:) to-
wards the north of them is a small star which
some of the Arabs reckon with those two, saying
that it (namely this mansion, K) consists of three
stars, and calling them الأَشْرَاطُ: (S, K:) IAar
mentions an instance of the use of the sing.,
الشَّرَطُ; but the dual is more approved, and more
commonly known: (TA:) the two stars above
mentioned are the first asterism of the spring.
(ISd, Z.) [See مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ, in art. نزل.] Hassán
Ibn-Thábit says,
فِى نَدَامَى بِيضِ الوُجُوهِ كِرَامٍ
نُبِّهُوا بَعْدَ هَجْعَةِ الأَشْرَاطِ
meaning [Among fair-faced, generous cup-companions, roused from sleep after] the setting of
the اشراط: though another meaning, which see
below, has been assigned to the last word. (Sgh.)
―
-b3-  And hence, (ISd, Z,) شَرَطٌ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  The
beginning of a thing; (ISd, * Z, * K;) as also
↓ مِشْرَاطٌ: (Ibn-'Abbád, K:) pl. of the former,
أَشْرَاطٌ, which is applied to the beginnings of any
event that happens because the شَرَطَان are the
first asterism of the spring: (ISd, Z:) the pl. of
↓ مشراط in the sense here expl. is مَشَارِيطُ. (K.)
Hence, accord. to some, أَشْرَاطُ السَّاعَةِ, expl. above.
(TA.)
-A2-  The refuse, (S, Msb, K, TA,) such as
the galled in the back, and the emaciated, (TA,)
and the young, (K,) and the bad, (A'Obeyd,) of
camels or the like, (S, K,) or of goats, (Msb,) or
of goats also: (S:) used alike as sing. and pl. and
masc. and fem.: and applied particularly to the
young of camels, as a pl. and as a sing.: also, to
a she-camel and to a he-camel: and to such, of
camels, as is brought, or driven, from one place
to another for sale; as the aged she-camel, and the
camel that is galled in the back: (TA:) also the
same, not ↓ شَرْطٌ as in the K, [without restriction
of its application,] low, base, vile, or mean; (K, *
TA;) and so ↓ أَشْرَطُ: (TA:) pl. أَشْرَاطٌ, (S, K,)
and pl. pl. أَشَارِيطُ. (S,* TA.) You say, الغَنَمُ
أَشْرَاطُ المَالِ [Sheep, or goats, are the refuse, or
meanest sort, of beasts that people possess]. (S.)
And شَرَطٌ is also applied to men; (S, TA;) شَرَطُ
النَّاسِ signifying The refuse, or lowest or basest or
meanest sort, pf mankind or people. (TA.) In
the verse of Hassán Ibn-Thábit cited above,
الأَشْرَاط is said to mean The guards, or watchmen,
and the lowest or basest or meanest sort of people;
(S, Sgh;) [so that هَجْعَة must be understood in
the sense of “ a light sleep in the first part of the
night; ”] but the correct meaning is that expl.
before. (Sgh.) ―
-b2-  Also أَشْرَاطٌ, The noble, eminent,
or honourable, sort of men: thus the word has
two contr. significations. (Yaakoob, S, K.)

of ten cubits: (AHn, O, K:) or what flows from
even tracts of ground into the [larger water-courses called] شِعَاب. (TA.)

the pl. (Mgh, K) of the former, (K,) The choice
men of the army: (Mgh:) and such as compose
the first portion of the army that is present in the
war or fight, (Mgh, K,) and prepare for death;
(K;) [the braves of an army;] they are the
Sultán's choice men of the army; and the term
شُرْطَةٌ is applied in a trad. to a party making it a
condition to die, and not return, unless victorious:
(TA:) or this appellation, and ↓ شُرَطَةٌ, which is a
rare form, are applied to a body of soldiers; and
the pl. is شُرَطٌ: and the pl. is applied to the aids
(أَعْوَان [here app. meaning guards]) of the Sul-
tán: (Msb:) شُرْطَةٌ, also, is applied to a wellknown body of the aids (أَعْوَان [here meaning
armed attendants, officers, or soldiers,]) of the
prefects [of the police]; (K;) pl. شُرَطٌ: (TA:) the
شُرَط, (As, S, Msb,) or the شُرْطَة, (K,) are so
called because they assumed to themselves signs,
or marks, whereby they might be known (As,
S, Msb, K) to the enemies: (Msb:) or the شُرَط
are so called because they were prepared: (AO,
S:) or as being likened to the شَرَط, or “ refuse,”
of goats; because they were low persons: (Msb:)
[or, probably, because they were prepared, or exposed, to be slain:] a single person of the شُرَط is
called شُرْطَةٌ (S, Msb) and ↓ شُرَطِىٌّ: (S:) or
↓ شُرْطِىٌّ and ↓ شُرْطِىٌّ are applied to a single person
of the شُرْطَة: (K:) ↓ شُرْطِىٌّ is a rel. n. from شُرْطَةٌ;
and such also is ↓ شُرَطِىٌّ from شُرَطَةٌ; not from
شُرَطٌ, because this is a pl. (Mgh.) صَاحِبُ الشُّرْطَةِ
signifies The governor, or prefect, (Mgh, Msb,)
[of the police, or] of a town, or city, or district,
or province; to whom formerly pertained both
religious and civil affairs; but now it is not so.
(Mgh. [See رِدْفٌ.]) [In later times, this title
has been commonly applied to The chief, or
prefect, of the police.] ―
-b2-  Also The best, best part,
or choice, of anything; as also ↓ شَرِيطَةٌ: the latter
occurring in a trad., as related by Sh; but Az
thinks it should be the former word. (TA.)
شُرَطَةٌ: see شُرْطَةٌ, in two places.
شَرَطِىٌّ Of, or relating to, [the asterism called]
the شَرَطَان and the أَشْرَاط; as also ↓ أَشْرَاطِىٌّ; the
latter being formed from the pl., (IB, TA,)
because the stars thus called are regarded as
composing one thing. (TA.) You say, رَوْضَةٌ
↓ أَشْرَاطِيَّةٌ, meaning [A garden, or meadow, &c.,]
rained upon by the نَوْء [q. v.] of the شَرَطَان. (S.
TA.) In the A we find ↓ نَوْءٌ شِرَاطِىٌّ: but probably it should be شَرَطِىٌّ. (TA.)
شُرْطِىٌّ and شُرَطِىٌّ: see شُرْطَةٌ, in five places.
شَرِيطٌ A rope, or cord, of twisted palm-leaves:

the palm-tree [twisted together]: (TA:) or palmleaves twisted together, with which is woven

bier, [app. meaning the part thereof upon which
a man or corpse lies,] and the like: (O, K:) so
called because its palm-leaves are split, and then
twisted together: if of fibres of the palm-tree, it is

like the scarification of the cupper, without the
severing of the [veins called] أَوْدَاج, and without
making the blood to flow copiously: thus they
used to do in the Time of Ignorance, cutting a
little of the animal's throat, (K, TA,) and then
leaving it to die; (TA;) and they considered it a
lawful mode of slaughtering it; but the eating of
such an animal is forbidden in a trad.: (K, TA:)
or one scarified on account of some disease; and
when such died, they said that they had slaughtered it. (TA.)
شِرَاطِىٌّ: see شَرَطِىٌّ.
شِرْوَاطٌ, applied to a man, Tall: (O, K:) and,
applied to a camel, (Ibn-'Abbád, O,) or to a hecamel, (Kudot;,) swift: (Ibn-'Abbád, O, K:) or it is

الغَنَمُ أَشْرَطُ المَالِ Sheep, or goats, are the vilest
sort of beasts that one possesses: an instance of a
noun of superiority without a verb; which is
extr.: (K, TA:) this is from the “ Isláh el-Alfádh ” of ISk: but in some of the copies of that
