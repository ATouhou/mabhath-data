K:) شَبَّهَتُ الشَّىْءَ بِالشَّىْءِ I put the thing in the
place, or predicament, of the [other] thing, by
reason of an attribute connecting them [or common
to them]; which attribute may be real and ideal;
real as when one says, “this dirhem is like this
dirhem,” and “ this blackness is like this blackness; ” and ideal as when one says, “Zeyd is
like the lion ” or “ like the ass ” i. e. in his strength
or his stupidity, and “ Zeyd is like 'Amr ” i. e. in
his power and his generosity and similar qualities;
and sometimes it is tropical, as when one says,
“ the absent is like the non-existent,” and “ the
garment is like the dirhem ” i. e. the value of
the garment is equivalent to the dirhem. (Msb.)

equivocal, or ambiguous; i. e. susceptible of different interpretations: (Ksh:) or verses unintelligible; such as the commencements [of many] of
the chapters: (Jel:) or the مُتَشَابِه in the Kur is
that of which the meaning is not to be learned
from its words; and this is of two sorts; one is
that of which the meaning is known by referring
it to what is termed مُحْكَم [q. v.]; and the other
is that of which the knowledge of its real meaning
is not attainable in any way: (TA:) or it means
what is not understood without repeated con-
sideration: (TA in art. فسر:) Ed-Dahhák is related to have explained المُحْكَمَاتُ as meaning
“ what have not been abrogated; ” and المُتَشَابِهَاتُ
as meaning what have been abrogated. (TA in
the present art.)
