which clothes are put: (S:) Suh says, in the R,
that they used to call the water-skin شَجْبٌ, and
they used not to hold it otherwise than suspended,
so that مِشْجَبٌ properly signifies the piece of
wood, or stick, to which the water-skin is suspended: then they amplified the application of
this word so as to call thereby the thing upon which
clothes are suspended: (MF, TA:) the pl. is
مَشَاجِبُ. (A.)
