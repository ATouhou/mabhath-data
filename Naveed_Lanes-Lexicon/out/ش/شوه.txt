his neck was short: (TK:) or شَوَهٌ said of the neck
[of a horse] signifies the being extended: and said

accord. to Abu-l-Mekárim this means say not,
How eloquent art thou! (Az, TA,) or say not,
How beautiful art thou! (ISk, S,) and so doing
smite me with the [evil] eye, or with an [evil] eye.
(ISk, Az, S, TA.) ↓ تشوّه signifies He practised

شَآءٌ: see the next paragraph.
شَاةٌ, (S, Msb, K, &c.,) originally شَاهَةٌ, (S, Msb,
TA,) A sheep, or goat; [each and either, but more
commonly the former; see an instance voce
صُوفٌ;] i. e. one of what are termed غَنَم; (S, *
Msb, * K;) applied to the male and to the female;
(S, Msb, K;) so that one says of the male, هٰذَا شَاةٌ,
(Msb,) which is said by Kh to be like the phrase
هٰذَا رَحْمَةٌ مِنْ رَبِّى; (Sb, TA;) and of the female,
هٰذِهِ شَاةٌ; and شَاةٌ ذَكَرٌ and شَاةٌ أُنْثَى: (Msb:) or it
may be [one] of sheep, and of goats, and of
gazelles or antelopes, and of the bovine kind [app.
of the wild bovine kind i. e. of bovine antelopes],
and of ostriches, and of wild asses; (K;) it is
applied to a wild bull by Tarafeh, in his saying,
كَسَامِعَتَىْ شَاةٍ بِحَوْمَلَ مُفْرَدِ
(S) i. e. Like the two ears of a wild bull, in
Howmal, solitary; the poet likening thereto the
ears of a she-camel in respect of sharpness and
erectness; (EM p. 76;) and likewise by Lebeed,
and by El-Farezdak: (IB, TA:) and it is also
applied to [a wild cow; (though said in the K in
art. شوى to signify the wild bull, specially the
male;) and hence, as being likened thereto,] (tropical:)  a
woman; (K, TA;) thus by El-Aashà; and thus
also by Antarah, in his saying,
يَا شَاةَ مَا قَنَصٍ لِمَنْ حَلَّتْ لَهُ
حَرُمَتْ عَلَىَّ وَلَيْتَهَا لَمْ تَحْرُمِ
(TA) O شاة [i. e. wild cow] of the chase (ما being
redundant) for him to whom she is lawful: she
has become forbidden to me, and would that she
were not forbidden: (EM p. 246:) pl. ↓ شَآءٌ, (S,
Msb, K,) originally شَاهٌ, (K,) used when they are
many in number, (S,) [but this is properly termed
a coll. gen. n.,] and شِيَاهٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) with
ه, which is used of a number from three to ten
[inclusive], for more than which it is with ت
[meaning ة, i. e. شَاةٌ, agreeably with a general
rule], (S,) and شِوَاهٌ, [the original of شِيَاهٌ,] (K,)
and ↓ شَوِىٌّ, (S, K, TA, [in the CK, erroneously,
شَوًى,]) which is pl. of شَآءٌ, (S, TA,) or rather a
quasi-pl. n., originally شَوِيهٌ, the ه being changed
into ى like as it is in ذِى for ذِهْ, (TA,) and
أَشَاوِهُ, (K,) and ↓ شَيْهٌ, (so in copies of the K, [in
the TA said to be like عِنَبٌ, which is a mistake,
(perhaps for عَيْنٌ,) for it is there said to be a
quasi-pl. n., which could not be said if it were
شِيَهٌ,]) and ↓ شِيهٌ, (CK, [but this, which is another
quasi-pl. n., is not in my MS. copy of the K nor
in the TA,]) and ↓ شَيِّهٌ, (K,) originally شَيْوِهٌ, but
this, also, is a quasi-pl. n., (TA,) and ↓ شِيَةٌ also is
syn. with شَآءٌ: (IAar, K in art. شوى:) it has not
a pl. formed with ا and ت, [i. e. it has not for a
pl. شَاآتٌ,] whether it be used as a gen. n. or as a
proper name: (TA:) the dim. is ↓ شُوَيْهَةٌ. (S,
Msb.) The sing. is also used in the sense of the
pl., in the saying فُلَانٌ كَثِيرُ الشَّاةِ وَالبَعِيرِ [Such a
one is possessor of a large number of sheep or
goats, and of camels], because the article ال
denotes the genus. (S.) And it is said in a trad.
فَأَمَرَ لَهَا بِشِيَاهِ غَنَمٍ [And he ordered that sheep or
goats should be given to her]: شياه being prefixed
to غنم, governing it in the gen. case, for the sake
of distinction; because the Arabs [sometimes]
call an animal of the wild bovine kind شاة. (IAth,
TA.) ―
-b2-  الشَّاةُ is also the name of (assumed tropical:)  Certain small
stars (K in art. شوى) between القرحه [or الفرجة,
thus in the work of Kzw, in his descr. of Cepheus,
and there said to be the star in the breast of
Cepheus,] and الجَدْىُ [i. e. the pole-star]; (TA
in that art.;) [the same that are described by Kzw
as certain small stars, called by the Arabs الأَغْنَامُ,
between the legs of Cepheus and the star الجَدْىُ.]

شَاهِىٌّ: see the next paragraph.
شَاوِىٌّ and ↓ شَاهِىٌّ A man possessing شَآء [meaning sheep or goats or both]: (K:) the former is
the rel. n. of شَآءٌ; and the latter, that of شَاةٌ: but
used as a proper name of a man, it is ↓ شَائِىٌّ, and,
if you will, شَاوِىٌّ. (S, TA. *)

sides of the mouth]: (S:) or long in the head, and

excites admiration and approval by her beauty or
excellence: (K, * TA:) or exceedingly wide in the
شِدْقَانِ [or two sides of the mouth] and the nostrils: (K, TA:) or, as some say, wide in the
mouth: (TA:) and small in the mouth: thus
having two contr. meanings: (K, TA:) or sharpsighted: (T, TA:) or sharp in spirit: (TA:) see
