شَمْعٌ and شَمَعٌ, both chaste accord. to ISd:
(TA:) accord. to Fr, (S, O, Msb, TA,) the former
is post-classical; (S, O, Msb, K, TA;) but ISd
says that this is a mistake: (TA:) accord. to ISk
one should say the latter, and not the former:
(TA:) or accord. to him, the word is with fet-h
to the م, and some of the Arabs make the م
quiescent: accord. to Th, it is with fet-h to the م;
and if you will, you may make it quiescent:
accord. to IF, the م is sometimes with fet-h; so
that he gives one to understand that it is more frequently made quiescent: (Msb:) A kind of thing
with which one lights himself: (S, O, Msb, K:)

bees' wax]: (Lth, K:) the n. un., (CK,) or what
denotes a piece, or portion, thereof, (so in copies
of the K and in the TA,) is with ة, (K, TA,)

particular signification. (S, O.)
