اشفق signifies He feared, or was cautious;
as also ↓ شَفِقَ [in the CK شَفَقَ]; or only the
former: (K, TA:) [accord. to ISd,] ↓ شَفِقَ, inf. n.
شَفَقٌ, signifies he feared: (M:) IDrd says, ↓ شَفِقْتُ
[in one of my copies of the S شفَقتُ] and أَشْفَقْتُ
are syn., (S, O, TA,) as some assert, (O, TA,)
but the lexicologists disallow this, (S, O,) saying
that one should only say أَشْفَقْتُ: (O:) accord. to
Er-Rághib, الإِشْفَاقُ signifies [the being affected
with] care, or solicitude, mixed with fear; and
when it is trans. by means of مِنْ, the meaning of
fear is most apparent in it; but when trans. by
means of عَلَى, the meaning of care, or solicitude,
is most apparent in it: (TA: [and the like is said
by Bd in xxi. 29:]) or it signifies [the being
affected with] fright [or fear]; sometimes mixed
with faithful or sincere or honest advice; and
sometimes divested thereof: (Ham p. 179:) one
says, أَشْفَقْتُ مِنْهُ, (S,) or مِنْ كَذَا, (Msb,) I
feared, or was cautious of, (S, Msb,) him, or it,
(S,) or such a thing: (Msb:) or اشفق مِنْهُ he
feared him, or it: (MA:) and أَشْفَقْتُ عَلَيْهِ, (S,
[in which it is implied that this differs from
أَشْفَقْتُ مِنْهُ,]) or عَلَى الصَّغِيرِ, I was affectionate,
kind, or compassionate, and favourably inclined,
[towards him, or] towards the little one: (Msb:
[and a similar explanation is given in the MA:])
and ↓ شَفَقْتُ, aor.
شَفِقَ, is a dial. var. thereof [i. e. of
أَشْفَقْتُ when trans. by means of عَلَى, and perhaps
also when it is trans. by means of مِنْ]: (Msb:)
or اشفق عَلَيْهِ signifies [he was solicitously affectionate, &c., towards him; agreeably with the
explanation of Er-Rághib above, and with that
here following;] he was affected with pity, or compassion, and tenderness, and fear, for him, at the
same time giving him faithful or sincere or honest
advice, أَنْ يَنَالَهُ مَكْرُوهٌ [lest some disliked or evil
event should betide him]: (TA:) or he feared, or
was cautious, for him: and اشفق مِنْهُ he was
impatient of him, or it: and ↓ شَفَقَ is a dial. var.
[of اشفق when trans. by means of مِنْ, and app.
also when trans. by means of عَلَى]. (M.)
-A2-  See
also 2.
-A3-  Also He entered upon [the time of]
the شَفَق [q. v.]. (M.) And He came in a [time
of] شَفَق: and so ↓ شفّق. (M.)
شَفَقٌ Fear: (K:) [see also شَفِقَ, (of which it is
the inf. n.) in the next preceding paragraph:] or
fear [arising] from strictness (شِدَّة) of faithful
or sincere or honest advice; (M, TA;) as also
↓ شَفَقَةٌ: (M:) or ↓ the latter signifies the fear of
him who gives faithful or sincere or honest advice,
in consequence of his doing so, for him to whom
such advice is given: (O:) or the former, (K,
TA,) and ↓ the latter also, (TA,) the eagerness,
or striving, of him who gives such advice, to
rectify, or amend, the state of him to whom that
advice is given: (K, TA: [said in the latter to be
a tropical application of the words; but why, I see
not:]) ↓ شَفَقَةٌ is subst. from الإِشْفَاقُ, (S, Msb,
TA,) and شَفَقٌ is syn. therewith (S, O, K, TA) as
being also a subst. from الإِشْفَاقُ: (S, TA:) [it is
said that] the primary signification of ↓ شَفَقَةٌ is
weakness: (Ham p. 179:) and it is conjoined with
خَوْفٌ [fear]; therefore it is not applied as an
attribute to God: (Idem p. 722:) [generally] it
signifies affection, kindness, benignity, compassion, or favourable inclination: (MA:) [or
solicitous affection &c.:] or pity, or compassion,
and tenderness, and fear of the betiding of some
disliked or evil event, together with faithful or
sincere or honest advice. (TA.)
-A2-  شَفَقٌ also
signifies The redness (Kh, S, Msb, K) in the
horizon (K) from sunset until the time of the last
عِشَآء [i. e. nightfall], (Kh, S, Msb, K,) when it
disappears, (Kh, S, Msb,) and the white شَفَق
remains until the middle [or rather until a late
period varying at different seasons] of the night:
(Msb:) or until near that time: or until near the
عَتَمَة [q. v., generally meaning the same, or nearly
so]: (K:) or the redness that is seen in the sky at
sunset: (IDrd, O:) or the remains of the light
and redness of the sun in the first part of the
night, until near the عَتَمَة: (S:) or the light and
redness of the sun, seen at sunset, until the time
of the prayer of nightfall: (M:) or the mixture
of the light of day with the blackness of night at
sunset: (Er-Rághib, TA:) accord. to Zj, the
redness that is in the region of sunset after the
setting of the sun: this is the meaning given as of
common repute in the books of lexicology; and
Mtr says [in the Mgh] that it means the redness
accord. to a number of the Companions of the
Prophet and of the people of the generation next
succeeding them: but accord. to Aboo-Hureyreh,
it means the whiteness [after sunset, which, to
distinguish it from the شَفَق commonly so called,
is often termed the white شَفَق, as in an instance
above]: (Msb:) IAth says that this word has
two contr. meanings; being applied to the redness
that is seen after sunset; and to the whiteness
remaining in the western horizon after the said
redness. (TA.) Fr says, I heard one of the
Arabs say, عَلَيْهِ ثَوْبٌ كَأَنَّهُ الشَّفَقُ [Upon him is,
or was, a garment as though it were the شَفَق]:
and it was red. (S.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] (tropical:)  A garment,
or piece of cloth, dyed red. (AA, TA.) ―
-b3-  And
Day. (Zj, M, K.)
-A3-  Also i. q. نَاحِيَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  [A side,
&c.; or a remote side]: pl. أَشْفَاقٌ. (O, K.) One
says, أَنَا فِى أَشْفَاقٍ مِنْ هٰذَا الأَمْرِ i. e. نَوَاحٍ [meaning (assumed tropical:)  I am apart, or aloof, from this affair; as
though in, or on, remote sides thereof]: (O, TA:)
and in like manner فِى عُرُوضٍ مِنْهُ [app. a mistranscription for عَرُوضٍ i. e. نَاحِيَةٍ] and فى
أَعْرَاضٍ منه i. e. نَوَاحٍ. (TA.)
-A4-  And (tropical:)  A bad
thing; syn. رَدِىْءٌ: (Lth, S, M, O, K, TA: [in the
TA said to be written by J with kesr to the ف;
but not so in either of my copies of the S:])
applied to a garment, or piece of cloth, (Mgh,
TA, and Ham p. 179,) [in this sense, or] as
meaning bad and thin: (Mgh in art. خرث:)
[said to be] from شَفَقَةٌ signifying “ weakness: ”
(Ham ubi suprà:) seldom pluralized: (O:) and
used alike as masc. and fem., being applied as an
epithet to a مِلْحَفَة, (M, O,) meaning رَدِيئَةٌ. (M.)
شَفِقٌ: see شَفِيقٌ, in two places.
شَفَقَةٌ: see شَفَقٌ, in five places.
شَفُوقٌ: see the next paragraph.
شَفِيقٌ is syn. with ↓ مُشْفِقٌ as part. n. of 4 [signifying Fearing, or fearful, or cautious; and also
affectionate, kind, or compassionate, &c.]; (S, O,
Msb, * K;) as also ↓ شَفِقٌ (Msb) [and in an intensive sense ↓ شَفُوقٌ; and , from what follows, it
appears that شَفِيقٌ also is used as an intensive
epithet]: or ↓ شَفِقٌ signifies fearing; and its pl. is
شَفِقُونَ: (M, TA:) and شَفِيقٌ, one giving faithful
or sincere or honest advice, eager, or striving, to
rectify, or amend, the state of him to whom that
advice is given. (M.)
إِنَّ الشَّفِيقَ بِسُوْءِ ظَنٍ مُولَعٌ
[Verily the affectionate, &c., or the very affectionate &c., is addicted to evil opinion,] is a
prov., applied in the case of the man who fears,
for his friend, the accidents of fortune, by reason
of his excessive شَفَقَة [or affection, &c.]. (TA.)
And it is said in the Kur [xxi. 50], وَهُمْ مِنَ
↓ السَّاعَةِ مُشْفِقُونَ [meaning And who are fearful
of the time of the resurrection]; the signification
of fear being most apparent when مُشْفِقٌ is thus
trans. by means of مِنْ. (TA.) See also an
instance of ↓ مُشْفِقٌ [in a similar sense] in the first
paragraph of this art.
مُشْفَقٌ: see the last paragraph.
