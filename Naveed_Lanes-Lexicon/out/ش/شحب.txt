altered [for the worse, wan, or haggard], (TA,)
or so شَاحِبُ اللَّوْنِ, (A,) in consequence of disease,
or travel, or the like: (TA: [see 1:]) and emaciated, or lean; (TA, KL;) as also ↓ شَحِبٌ.
(KL.) It is said in a trad., لَا تَلْقَى المُؤْمِنَ إِلَّا
شَاحِبًا [Thou wilt not find the believer otherwise
than wan, or haggard; or emaciated, or lean];
because شُحُوب is one of the effects of fear, and
of paucity of food, and of little enjoying of plentifulness and pleasantness or easiness, and softness
or delicacy, of life. (TA.) ―
-b2-  It is also applied
as an epithet to a sword, meaning Altered in its
colour by blood that has dried upon it: used in
this sense by the poet Taäbbata-sharrà. (TA.)
