شجو1
شَجِىَ, aor.
شَجَوَ, inf. n. شَجًا, He was choked;
or his throat, or fauces, became obstructed; (S,
K;) بِهِ by it; i. e. a bone or the like. (K.) One
says, عَلَيْكَ بِالكَظْمِ وَلَوْ شَجِيتَ بِالعَظْمِ [Keep thou
to self-restraint though thou be choked by the
bone]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And, [hence, by a metaphor,
(see Har p. 33,)] aor. and inf. n. as above, (assumed tropical:)  He
grieved, mourned, or lamented; or was sorrowful,
sad, or unhappy: (S, Msb:) and he was, or became, anxious, or disquieted in mind. (S.) ―
-b3-
Also, aor. and inf. n. as above, said of a creditor
(غَرِيم), He went away, عَنْهُ [from him]. (K.
[See 4.])
-A2-  شَجَا بَيْنَهُمْ It was, or became, an
occasion of contention, or dispute, or of disagreement, or difference, between them. (K.)
-A3-  شَجَاهُ,
(S, Msb, K,) aor.
شَجُوَ, inf. n. شَجْوٌ, (S, Msb,) [app.
originally syn. with أَشْجَاهُ in the first of the senses
assigned to the latter in the next paragraph: ―
-b2-
and hence,] (assumed tropical:)  It (anxiety, Msb) grieved him; or
caused him to mourn or lament, or to be sorrowful
or sad or unhappy; (S, Msb, K;) as also ↓ اشجاهُ.
(K.) And, said of wealth (الغِنَى), inf. n. شَجْوٌ,
It excited his griefs, mournings, &c., and his
desire. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Also, and ↓ اشجاهُ, (assumed tropical:)  It caused
him to be mirthful, (Ks, K, TA,) and excited
him. (Ks, TA.) Thus each of these verbs has
two contr. significations. (K.) But MF observes
that طَرَّبَهُ, the explanation here given in the K,
is said by the author of the K [in art. طرب] to
denote a lightness arising from joy or grief. (TA.)
[Generally, however, it means as rendered above.]
4
اشجاهُ, inf. n. إِشْجَآءٌ, It choked him; or
caused his throat, or fauces, to be obstructed;
syn. أَغَصَّهُ; (S, TA;) said of a bone lying across
in the throat, or fauces. (TA.) [This is clearly
shown to be the meaning in the S, as well as in
the TA, intended by أَغَصَّهُ; with which it is also
syn. in another sense; for] ―
-b2-  It signifies [also]
(assumed tropical:)  It, or he, caused him to fall into grief, mourning, lamentation, sorrow, sadness, or unhappiness.
(K.) See also 1, in two places. ―
-b3-  Also (assumed tropical:)  He
subdued, overpowered, or overcame, him, (K,
TA,) so that he grieved, or was sorrowful. (TA.)
―
-b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  He angered him. (Ks, TA.) ―
-b5-  And
(assumed tropical:)  He made him to go away. (Az, TA.) And
أَشْجَيْتُهُ عَنِّى (assumed tropical:)  I gave him (i. e. a creditor or petitioner) what contented him, so that he went away.
(TA.)

تَشَاجَتْ عَلَيْهِ, (As, T, K, * TA,) said of a
woman of the desert with reference to a young
man who had been dallying, and holding amorous
converse, with her, (As, T, TA,) (assumed tropical:)  She resisted
him, and expressed grief, or unhappiness, to him,
or on account of him, [i. e. on account of his
advances,] saying, Alas, my grief, or my unhappiness! (As, T, K, * TA.) And said of a
woman with reference to her husband, meaning
(assumed tropical:)  She expressed grief, &c., as above. (A, TA.)
شَجًا A bone, or some other thing (S, K) of the
like sort, (K,) sticking fast, (S,) or lying across,
or forming an obstruction, (K,) in the throat, or
fauces, (S, K,) of a human being, and of a beast;
(TA;) a thing in the throat, or fauces, that
[chokes one, or] prevents from swallowing: (Har
p. 69:) an inf. n. used as a subst. [properly thus
termed]. (Har p. 33.) ―
-b2-  See also the next paragraph.
شَجْوٌ (assumed tropical:)  Anxiety, or disquietude of mind; and
grief, mourning, lamentation, sorrow, sadness,
or unhappiness; (S;) [and] so ↓ شَجًا: thus
termed because a man is choked thereby. (Har
p. 33.) ―
-b2-  And (assumed tropical:)  A want; an object of want.
(Az, K, TA.) One says, بَكَى فُلَانٌ شَجْوَهُ [app.
meaning (assumed tropical:)  Such a one wept for his object of want]:
and دَعَتِ الحَمَامَةُ شَجْوَهَا [app. (assumed tropical:)  The pigeon called
for its object of want]. (TA.)
شَجٍ (assumed tropical:)  Grieving, mourning, or lamenting; or
sorrowing, sad, or unhappy; applied to a man;
(S, Msb;) and شَجِيَةٌ, of the measure فَعِلَةٌ, applied to a woman: one says, وَيْلٌ لِلشَّجِى مِنَ
الخَلِىِّ [mentioned and expl. voce خَالٍ, in art.
خلو, where each of these epithets is written with
teshdeed to the ى; and likewise in another saying there mentioned]: (S:) or, in this saying,
(TA,) it signifies occupied [by anxiety or grief];
(K, TA; [in the CK, الشَّجا is erroneously put
for الشَّجِى;]) and خَلِىّ means “ free [therefrom]: ” so says AZ: and in this instance الشَّجِى
may mean occupied by a bone choking, or obstructing, his throat, or fauces, or by anxiety,
and not having found a way of escape therefrom;
or by his opponent, or adversary, whom he has
been unable to withstand: (TA:) and sometimes
one says ↓ شَجِىٌّ, like as one says حَزِنٌ and
حَزِينٌ; though this is rare; (Msb;) it is mentioned in the 'Eyn; but شَجٍ is more known; and
is said by Az to be the chaste form: (TA:) Mbr
says, the ى of الخلى is with teshdeed, and the
ى of الشَّجِى is without teshdeed, (S,) and sometimes this ى is with teshdeed in poetry; (S, K;)
but if you make it to be from شَجَاهُ, it is ↓ شَجِىٌّ
only, syn. with مَشْجُوٌّ. [i. e. grieved, &c.]; (S;)
and so it is said to be by Az and Z: and Az adds,
the second way of accounting for it is, that they
often lengthen فَعِلٌ with a ى, saying, فُلَانٌ قَمِنٌ
لِكَذَا and قَمِينٌ, and سَمِجٌ and سَمِيجٌ, and كَرٍ and
كَرِىٌّ: and the third way is, that they assimilated one word in measure to another, as in الغَدَايَا
وَالعَشَايَا, the [proper] pl. of غَدَاةٌ being only
غَدَوَاتٌ. (TA.)
شَجِىٌّ: see the next preceding paragraph, in
two places.
مَفَازَةٌ شَجْوَآءُ [A desert, or waterless desert,]
difficult to travel. (S, K. *)
شَجَوِىٌّ, with fet-h to the ج; rel. n. of شَجٍ. (S.)
شَجَوْجًى, (S, K,) of the measure فَعَوْعَلٌ [and
therefore with tenween], (Mz 40th نوع, and MF
and TA,) like خَجَوْجًى &c., (S, * and Mz ibid.,)
and ↓ شَجَوْجَآءٌ, (K,) applied to a man, (S,) Long
in the legs: (S, K:) or very tall: or very tall,
with bigness (ضِخَم, in the CK ضَخْم,) of the
bones: or long in the back, short in the leg; (K;)
thus in the M; but Az says the reverse, i. e. long
in the legs, short in the back. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also,
(K,) or the former, (TA,) A bulky horse. (K.)
―
-b3-  And The عَقْعَق [or magpie]; (K;) [and] so
شَجَجَى; (K and TA in art. شج;) fem. with ة
[i. e. شَجَوْجَاةٌ]. (K.) ―
-b4-  And A wind continually
blowing; as also شَجَوْجَاةٌ. (K.) All this is in
the M. (TA.)
شَجَوْجَآءٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
أَمْرٌ شَاجٍ An affair, or event, grieving; or
causing to mourn or lament, or to be sorrowful or
sad or unhappy. (TA.)
