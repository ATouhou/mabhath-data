شقرقشَقِرَّاقٌ and شِقِرَّاقٌ, (S, O, Msb, K,) the former
accord. to IAar, (Th, TA,) the latter accord. to
Fr, (TA,) but disallowed by IKt, and asserted by
him to be a mispronunciation of the vulgar,
(Msb,) and شِقْرَاقٌ, (Msb, K,) and شَقْرَاقٌ, (accord.
to the CK,) and, (S, O, K,) as they sometimes
said, (S, O,) شِرِقْرَاقٌ, (S, O, K,) and شَرَقْرَاقٌ, and
شَرَقْرَقٌ, (K,) [the first and second now applied to
The green wood-pecker, picus viridis: and to the
common roller, coracias garrula:] a certain bird,
(S, O, Msb, K,) well known, (K,) among the
Arabs, (Fr, TA,) called أَخْيَل, (Fr, S, O, Msb,
TA,) [a name likewise now applied to the green
wood-pecker,] and regarded by the Arabs as of
evil omen; (S;) less than the pigeon, the colour
of which is green, and the beak black, and having
blackness in the extremities and exterior of its
wings: (Msb:) accord. to IAar, the شَقِرَّاق is
with the Arabs the أَخْطَب [q. v.]: (TA:) accord.
to the K, or شقرّاق and شرقراق accord. to Lth,
(TA,) a certain bird speckled, or spotted, with
green and red and white (K, TA) and black,
(TA,) and found, accord. to the copies of the K,
in the land of the Haram, but correctly, as in the
words of Lth, بارض الجرم, thus, with ج, [perhaps
rightly بِالأَرْضِ الجَرْمِ, in the land that is hot, or very
hot,] in the places in which palm-trees grow; of the
size of the هُدْهُد [or hoopoe]: accord. to Lh, شقرّاق
is of the measure فعلّال: شرقراق is mentioned by J
and Sgh [as well as in the K] in the present art.;
but should, properly, be mentioned under the head
of شرقرق, as it is in the L. (TA.)
