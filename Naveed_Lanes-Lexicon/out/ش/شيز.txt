شيزشِيزٌ and ↓ شِيزَى A kind of black wood, of which
bowls (قِصَاع) are made: (S, K:) or the latter is
a certain black wood of which combs and bowls
(جِفَان) are made: (Mgh:) or ebony: or سَاسَم
[a certain wood of which bows or arrows are
made]: (AA, K:) or walnut-wood: (As, EdDeenäwaree [AHn], Mgh, K:) As says of the
شيزى, by the name of which the Arabs call
bowls (جفان and قصاع) and the sheaves of pulleys, that it is walnut-wood, but it becomes blackened by grease, and therefore is thus called, and
it is not شيز: so says AHn: and he adds, the case
is as he has described it; for the شيز does not
become thick so as that bowls may be carved
from it: (Sgh, TA:) of this latter, only combs and
the like are made; and it is black: it is also said,
in the T, that bowls made from the walnut-tree
are called شِيزَى. (TA.)
شِيزَى: see the preceding paragraph.
