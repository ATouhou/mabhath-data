شَعَرَ بِهِ, (S, Msb, K, &c.,) and شَعُرَ بِهِ, (K,)
which latter is disallowed by some, but both are
correct, though the former is the [more] chaste,
(TA,) aor.
شَعُرَ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. شِعْرٌ (S, Msb,
K, &c.) and شَعْرٌ (K, TA) and شَعَرٌ, (TA, and so
in the CK in the place of شَعْرٌ,) but the first is the
most common, (TA,) and شِعْرَةٌ (Msb, K) and
شَعْرَةٌ and شُعْرَةٌ, (K,) of which last three the first
is the most common, (TA,) and شِعْرَى and شُعْرَى
(K) and شَعْرَى (TA) and شُعُورٌ (Msb, K) and
شُعُورَةٌ, (K,) which is said to be the inf. n. of شَعُرَ,
(TA,) and مَشْعُورٌ and مَشْعُورَةٌ (Lh, K) and
مَشْعُورَآءُ, (K,) which is of extr. form, (TA,) He

K, TA;) as also شَعَرَ لَهُ: (Lh, TA:) or he knew
the minute particulars of it: or he perceived it by
means of [any of] the senses. (TA.) Lh mentions
the phrase أَشْعُرُ فُلَانًا مَا عَمِلَهُ and أَشْعُرُ لِفُلَانٍ مَا
عَمِلَهُ [I know what such a one did or has done],
and مَا شَعَرْتُ فُلَانًا مَا عَمِلَهُ [I knew not what such
a one did], as on the authority of Ks, and says
that they are forms of speech used by the Arabs.

-b2-  شَعَرَ, (A, Msb,
K,) aor.
شَعُرَ, (Msb, K,) inf. n. شِعْرٌ and شَعْرٌ, (K,
TA,) or شَعَرٌ, (so accord. to the CK instead of
شَعْرٌ,) He said, or spoke, or gave utterance to,
poetry; spoke in verse; poetized; or versified;
syn. قَالَ شِعْرًا; [for poetry was always spoken by
the Arabs in the classical times; and seldom
written, if written at all, until after the life-time
of the author;] (A, Msb, K;) as also شَعُرَ: (K:)
or the latter signifies he made good, or excellent,
poetry or verses; (K, MF;) and this is the signification more commonly approved, as being more
agreeable with analogy: (MF:) or the latter signifies he was, or became, a poet; (S;) as also
شَعِرَ, aor.
شَعَرَ. (TA.) One says, شَعَرْتُ لِفُلَانٍ I
said, or spoke, poetry, &c., to such a one. (TS,
O, TA.) And لَوْ شَعُرَ بِنَقْصِهِ لَمَا شَعَرَ [Had he

شَاْعَرَ ↓ شَاعَرَهُ فَشَعَرَهُ, (S, K,) aor. of the latter
شَعَرَ,
that is with fet-h, (S, MF,) accord. to Ks, who
holds it to be thus even in this case, where superiority is signified, on account of the faucial
letter; or, accord. to most,
شَعُرَ, agreeably with the
general rule; (MF;) He vied, or contended, with
him in poetry, and he surpassed him therein. (S,
K, MF.)
-A2-  And شاعرهُ, (S,) and شاعرها, (A,
Msb, K,) and ↓ شَعَرَهَا, (A, K,) He slept with
him, and with her, (نَاوَمَهُ, S, and نَامَ مَعَهَا, Msb,

-A3-  [Reiske, as mentioned by Freytag, explains شاعر as signifying
also Tractavit, prensavit, vellicavit: but without
naming any authority.]
4
اشعرهُ He made him to know. (S.) You
say, اشعرهُ بِالأَمْرِ and الأَمْرَ, (K,) the latter of
which is less usual than the former, because one
says شَعَرَ بِهِ but not شَعَرَهُ, (MF,) He aquainted
him with the affair; made him to know it. (K.)
And أَشْعَرْتُ أَمْرَ فَلَانٍ I made known the affair of
such a one. (A.) And أَشْعَرْتُ فُلَانًا I made such
a one notorious for an evil deed or quality. (A.)
―
-b2-  Also, (inf. n. إِشْعَارٌ, Msb,) He marked it,
namely a beast destined for sacrifice at Mekkeh,
(S, * Mgh, Msb, * K, TA,) by stabbing it in the
right side of its hump so that blood flowed from
it, (S,) or by making a slit in its skin, (K,) or by
stabbing it (K, TA) in one side of its hump with
a مِبْضَع or the like, (TA,) so that the blood appeared, (K, TA,) or by making an incision in its
hump so that the blood flowed, (Msb,) in order
that it might be known to be destined for sacrifice. (S, Msb.) ―
-b3-  [Hence, app.,] (assumed tropical:)  He wounded

(TA:) and in another trad., أَشْعِرَ أَمِيرُ المُؤْمِنِينَ
(assumed tropical:)  [The Prince of the Faithful was wounded so
that blood came from him]. (S.) ―
-b4-  And (tropical:)  He
pierced him with a spear so as to make the spearhead enter his inside: and اشعرهُ سِنَانًا (tropical:)  he made
the spear-head to enter into the midst of him:
[but this is said to be] from اشعرهُ بِهِ “ he made
it to cleave to it. ” (TA.) أَشْعِرَ is said specially
of a king, meaning He was slain. (A, TA.) ―
-b5-
Also He made it to be a distinguishing sign: as
when the performance of a religious service is
made, or appointed, by God to be a sign [whereby
his religion is distinguished]. (TA.) ―
-b6-  And
اشعروا They called, uttering their شِعَار [whereby
they might know one another]: or they appointed
for themselves a شِعَار in their journey. (Lh, K,
TA. [See also 10.])
-A2-  مَا أَشْعَرَهُ [How good, or
excellent, a poet is he !]. (TA in art. خزى: see

-A3-  اشعر [from شَعْرٌ or شَعَرٌ signifying “ hair ”] It (a fœtus, S, A, K, in the belly
of its mother, TA) had hair growing upon it;
(S, A, K;) as also ↓ تشعّر; (S, K;) and ↓ شعّر,
inf. n. تَشْعِيرٌ; and ↓ استشعر. (K.) ―
-b2-  And اشعرت
She (a camel) cast forth her fœtus with hair upon
it. (Ktr, K.) ―
-b3-  And اشعر He lined a boot, (A,
K,) and a جُبَّة, (A,) and the مِيثَرَة of a horse's
saddle, and a قَلَنْسُوَة, and the like, (TA,) with
hair; (A, K;) as also ↓ شَعَرَ; (Lh, A, K;) and
↓ شعّر, (K,) inf. n. تَشْعِيرٌ: (TA:) or, said of a
ميثرة, he covered it with hair. (A.) ―
-b4-  And
اشعرهُ He clad him with a شِعَار [i. e. an innermost
garment]. (S, A, K.) And He put on him a
garment as a شِعَار, i. e., next his body. (TA.)
[Hence,] اشعرهُ فُلَانٌ شَرًّا (tropical:)  Such a one involved
him in evil. (S, A.) And اشعرهُ الحُبُّ مَرَضًا
(assumed tropical:)  [Love involved him in disease]. (S.) And

-b2-  Also, (A,) or
استشعر شِعَارًا, (K,) He put on, or clad himself

next to thy heart]. (TA.) And استشعر خَوْفًا

شَعْرٌ and ↓ شَعَرٌ, (A, Msb, K, but only the latter
in my copies of the S and in the O,) two wellknown dial. vars., the like being common in
cases of this kind, in which the medial radical
letter is a faucial, (MF,) [but the latter I have
found to be the more common,] Hair; i. e. what
grows upon the body, that is not صُوف nor وَبَر;
(K;) it is an appertenance of human beings and
of other animals: (S, A, Msb:) [when spoken of
as used in the fabrication of cloth for tents &c.,
the meaning intended is goats' hair: (see 4 in art.
بنى:)] of the masc. gender: (Msb, TA:) pl. (of
the former, Msb) شُعُورٌ and (of the latter, Msb)
أَشْعَارٌ (S, Msb, K) and (of the latter also, TA)
شِعَارٌ: (K, TA:) and ↓ أُشَيْعَارٌ, properly dim. of
أَشْعَارٌ, is used, accord. to Aboo-Ziyád, as dim. of
شُعُورٌ: (TA:) the n. un. is with ة: (S, A, * Msb,
K:) and this, i. e. شَعْرَةٌ [or شَعَرَهٌ], is also used
metonymically as a pl. (K, TA.) One says,
بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَكَ المَالُ شَقُّ الشَّعْرَةِ and شَقُّ الأُبْلُمَةِ (assumed tropical:)  [The
property is, or shall be, equally divided between
me and thee]. (TA.) And رَأَى فُلَانٌ الشَّعْرَةَ Such
a one saw, or has seen, hoariness, or white hairs,
(Yaakoob, S, A, TA,) upon his head. (TA.) ―
-b2-
[The n. un.] شَعْرَةٌ is also used, metonymically, as
meaning (tropical:)  A daughter. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And ↓ شَعَرٌ (K,
and so accord. to the TA, but in the CK ↓ شُعْرٌ,)
signifies also (tropical:)  Plants and trees; (K, TA;) as

-b4-  And the same,
(A, K, TA, but in the CK ↓ شُعْرٌ,) (tropical:)  Saffron

شُعْرٌ: see the next two preceding sentences.
شِعْرٌ [an inf. n., (see 1, first sentence,) and used
as a simple subst. signifying] Knowledge; cognizance: (K, TA:) or knowledge of the minute
particulars of things: or perception by means of
[any of] the senses. (TA.) One says, لَيْتَ
شِعْرِى فُلَانًا مَا صَنَعَ, (Ks, Lh, S, * Msb, * K, *) and

(Ks, Lh, K, *) i. e. Would that I knew what such
a one did, or has done; (S, * K, * Msb, * TA;)
for would that my knowledge were present at, or
comprehending, what such a one did, or has done;
the phrase being elliptical: (TA:) accord. to Sb,
لَيْتَ شِعْرِى is for ليت شِعْرَتِى, the ة being elided
as in هُوَ أَبُو عُذْرِهَا [for هو ابو عُذْرَتِهَا], (S, TA,) the
elision of the ة in this latter instance, as Sb says,
being peculiar to the case of the words being preceded by ابو; [but see عُذْرَةٌ;] and as in إِقَامَة
when used as a prefixed noun; though لَيْتَ شِعْرَتِى
is not now known to have been heard. (TA.)
One says also, لَيْتَ شِعْرِى مَا كَانَ Would that I
knew what happened, or has happened. (A.) ―
-b2-
The predominant signification of شِعْرٌ is Poetry,
or verse; (Msb, K;) because of its preeminence
by reason of the measure and the rhyme; though
every kind of knowledge is شِعْرٌ: (K:) or because
it relates the minute affairs of the Arabs, and the
occult particulars of their secret affairs, and their
facetiæ: (Er-Rághib, TA:) it is properly defined
as language qualified by rhyme and measure intentionally; which last restriction excludes the
like of the saying in the Kur [xciv. 3 and 4],
اَلَّذِى أَنْقَضَ ظَهْرَكْ وَرَفَعْنَا لَكَ ذِكْرَكْ, because this
is not intentionally qualified by rhyme and measure: (KT; and the like is said in the Msb:) and
sometimes a single verse is thus termed: (Akh,
TA:) pl. أَشْعَارٌ. (S, K.) ―
-b3-  Also (assumed tropical:)  Falsehood;
because of the many lies in poetry. (B, TA.)
شَعَرٌ: see شَعْرٌ, in two places.
شَعِرٌ: see أَشْعَرُ. ―

[particularly] A sheep or goat (شَاةٌ) having hair
growing between the two halves of its hoof, which

knees, (K, TA,) and therefore always scratching
with them. (TA.)

tenween,] or ↓ شَعْرَآء, [and if so, without tenween,]
accord to different copies of the K; (TA;) of a
man and of a woman; and of the hinder part of
a woman: (T, Msb:) or the hair of the pubes of
a woman, specially: (S, O, Msb:) and the pubes
(عَانَة) [itself]: (K:) and the place of growth of
the hair beneath the navel. (K, * TA.) ―

Sirius rises aurorally, the owner of the palm-trees

there are two stars of this name; الشِّعْرَى العَبُورُ
and الشِّعْرَى الغُمَيْصَآءُ, (S, K,) together called
الشِّعْرَيَانِ: the former is that [above mentioned]
which is in [a mistake for “ after ”] الجَوْزَآء, and the
latter is [Procyon,] in the ذِرَاع [by which is
meant الذِّرَاعُ المَقْبُوضَةُ, not الذِّرَاعُ المَبْسُوطَةُ]; (S;)
and both together are called the two Sisters of
Suheyl (سُهَيْل [i. e. Canopus]): (S, K:) the
former was worshipped by a portion of the Arabs;
and hence God is said in the Kur-án to be Lord of
الشِّعْرَى: (TA:) it is called العَبُور because of its
having crossed the Milky Way; and the other is
called الغُمَيْصَآء because said by the Arabs to have
wept after the former until it had foul thick
matter in the corner of the eye: (K in art. غمص:)
the former is also called الشِّعْرَى اليَمَانِيَّةُ [the
Yemenian, or Southern, شعرى]; and the latter,

(Bd in v. 2 and xxii. 33;) among which places

to Fr in the Kur v. 2: (TA:) or the obligatory
statutes or ordinances of God: (Bd in v. 2:) or

made fear to be as though it were his innermost

my MS. copy of the K) or الخُمْرُ, pls. of الخِمَارُ;
and Freytag has followed his example: but الخَمْرُ is
the right reading, as is shown by what here follows:]) so in the saying of El-Akhtal,
فَكَفَّ الرِّيحَ وَالأَنْدَآءَ عَنْهَا
مِنَ الزَّرَجُونِ دُونَهُمَا الشِّعَارُ
[evidently describing wine, and app. meaning

the medial radical letter is a faucial, and, accord.
to Lth, certain of the Arabs pronounced in a
similar manner any word of that measure of which
the medial radical letter is not a faucial, like
كَبِيرٌ and جَلِيلٌ and كَرِيمٌ, (MF,) [and thus do
many in the present day, others pronouncing the

termed إِمَالَة, i. e. as “ e ” in our word “ bed: ”

originally signifying a person who sleeps with
another in one innermost garment;] then applied
to any special companion. (TA.)

شَاعِرٌ A poet: (T, S, Msb, K:) so called because
of his intelligence; (S, Msb;) or because he knows
what others know not: (T, TA:) accord. to Akh,
it is a possessive epithet, like لَابِنٌ and تَامِرٌ: (S:)
pl. شُعَرَآءُ, (S, Msb, K,) deviating from analogy:
(S, Msb:) Sb says that the measure فَاعِلٌ is
likened in this case to فَعِيلٌ; and hence this pl.:
(TA:) or, accord. to IKh, the pl. is of this form
because the sing. is from شَعُرَ, and therefore
should by rule be of the measure فَعِيلٌ, like شَرِيفٌ
[from شَرُفَ]; but were it so, it might be confounded with شَعِير meaning the grain thus called,
therefore they said شَاعِرٌ, and regarded in the pl.
the original form of the sing. (Msb.) A wonderful poet is called خِنْذِيذٌ: one next below
him, شَاعِرٌ: then, ↓ شَوَيْعِرٌ [the dim.]: (Yoo, K:)
then, ↓ شُعْرُورٌ: and then, ↓ مَتَشَاعِرٌ. (K.) ―

-b3-  شِعْرٌ شَاعِرٌ Excellent poetry: (Sb,
T, K:) or known poetry: but the former explanation is the more correct. (TA.) One also says,
sometimes, كَلِمَةٌ شَاعِرَةٌ, [by كلمة] meaning
قَصِيدَةٌ: but generally in a phrase of this kind the
two words are cognate, as in وَيْلٌ وَائِلٌ and لَيْلٌ لَائِلٌ.

-b3-  And A furred garment. (Th,
K.) ―
-b4-  And as an epithet, (tropical:)  Evil, foul, or abominable: [as being likened to that which is shaggy,
and therefore unseemly:] (K, * TA:) in the K,
الخَشِنَةُ is erroneously put for الخَبِيثَةُ. (TA.) One
says, دَاهِيَةٌ شَعْرَآءُ, (S, A, K,) and وَبْرَآءُ, (S, A,)
and زَبَّآءُ, (TA in art. زب,) (tropical:)  An evil, a foul, or an
abominable, (TA,) or a severe, or great, (K,) calamity or misfortune: pl. شُعْرٌ. (K, TA.) And

or an abominable, thing]. (S, A. *) ―
-b5-  And أَشْعَرُ
signifies also The hair that surrounds the solid
hoof: (S:) or [the extremity, or border, of the
pastern, next the solid hoof; i. e.] the extremity
of the skin surrounding the solid hoof, (K, TA,)
where the small hairs grow around it: (TA:) or
the part between the hoof of a horse and the place
where the hair of the pastern terminates: and the
part of a camel's foot where the hair terminates:
(TA:) pl. أَشَاعِرُ, (S, TA,) because it is [in this
sense] a subst. (TA.) ―
-b6-  Also The side of the
vulva, or external portion of the female organs
of generation: (K:) it is said that the أَشْعَرَانِ are
the إِسْكَتَانِ, which are the two sides [or labia
majora] of the vulva of a woman: or the two
parts next to the شُفْرَانِ, which are the two borders

signifies many trees: (A 'Obeyd, S:) or i. q. أَجَمَةٌ
[i. e. a thicket, wood, or forest; &c.]: (TA:) and
a meadow (رَوْضَةٌ, AHn, A, K, TA) having its

a sting, (S,) blue, or red, that alights upon camels
and asses and dogs; (K;) as also ↓ شُعَيْرَآءُ: (TA:)
a kind of fly that stings the ass, so that he goes
round: AHn says that it is of two species, that
of the dog and that of the camel: that of the dog
is well known, inclines to slenderness and redness,
and touches nothing but the dog: that of the
camel inclines to yellowness, is larger than that
of the dog, has wings, and is downy under the
wings: sometimes it is in such numbers that the
owners of the camels cannot milk in the day-time
nor ride any of them; so that they leave doing
this until night: it stings the camel in the soft
parts of the udder and around them, and beneath
the tail and the belly and the armpits; and they
do not protect the animal from it save by tar:
it flies over the camels so that one hears it to
make a humming, or buzzing, sound. (TA. [See
also شُعْرُورٌ, under which its pl. شُعْرٌ is mentioned.])
