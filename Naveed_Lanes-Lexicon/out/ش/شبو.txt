thing that annoys, &c.]. (TA.)

الشَّبَا signifying its sting; (Ham p. 385;) determinate; (TA;) imperfectly decl.: (A'Obeyd, S,
TA:) it is said in the K, “and [the article] ال
is prefixed to it; ” but this is a mistake: it should
be, “and ال is not prefixed to it: (TA:) [but,
although a proper name, it has a pl.;] the pl. is
شَبَوَاتٌ. (S.) [See also شَبَاةٌ, which signifies “ a
scorpion,” and of which شَبَوَاتٌ is a pl.] ―
