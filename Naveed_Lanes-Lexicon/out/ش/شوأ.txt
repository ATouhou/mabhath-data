شوأ1
شَآءَنِى, formed by transposition from شَآنِى,
aor. يَشُوْءُ and يَشِىْءُ, [but the latter form of the
aor. is disallowed by MF,] He preceded me, or
outwent me. (K.)
-A2-  And He grieved me. (K.)
―
-b2-  And He pleased me. (K.) Thus it bears two
contr. significations. (TA.) And شُؤْتُهُ, aor.
أَشُوْؤُهُ, I pleased him. (Lth, O.) ―
-b3-  And شُؤْتُ بِهِ I
was pleased with, and rejoiced in, him, or it.
(Lth, O, K.) [See also art. شأو.]
شَآءٌ, n. un. شَاةٌ: see art. شوه.
شَيِّآنٌ, (K, TA, and L in art. تيح,) in form like
the dual of سَيِّدٌ [except as to the final vowel],
(TA,) [erroneously written in the CK شَيْئاٰن,]
and شَيَّآنٌ, like تَيِّحَانٌ and تَيَّحَانٌ [q. v.], (L in
art. تيح,) [applied to a man,] Far-sighted; (K;)
either in the proper sense, or metonymically applied to a man characterized by deliberation, and
reflection, and looking to the results of affairs.
(TA.) Each is also applied as an epithet to a
horse. (L in art. تيح.) [The radical letters of
this epithet are either شوأ or شيأ; therefore it is
mentioned again in art. شيأ; and another form
thereof, without ء, (شَيَّان,) is mentioned in art.
شوى.]
