انشبل is expl. by Golius as signifying
“Leviter e loco exivit, effluxit;” as on the authority of the KL; but I do not find it in my copy
of that work; and think that it is some other
word to which this meaning is there assigned.]
شِبْلٌ The whelp, or young one, of the lion:
(S, Mgh, O, Msb:) or the young one of the lion
when it has attained to the seeking, or taking, of
prey: (K, TA:) [and Freytag says, on the authority of Meyd, of any wild beast:] pl. أَشْبَالٌ
(S, O, Msb, K) and أَشْبُلٌ (S, O, K) [both properly pls. of pauc.] and [pl. of mult.] شُبُولٌ and
شِبَالٌ. (K.)
شَابِلٌ A lion whose canine teeth have become
such as lock together, dissimilar; expl. by the
words اَلَّذِى اشْتَبَكَتْ أَنْيَابُهُ. (K. [Perhaps, in this
sense, a mistranscription for شَابِكٌ, q. v.]) ―
-b2-  And
(K) (assumed tropical:)  A boy, or young man, full [or plump] in
body, by reason of ease and plenty and of youthfulness: (IAar, O, K: *) and so شَابِنٌ, and
حِضَجْرٌ. (IAar, O.) ―
-b3-  [شَابِلَةٌ, expl. by Golius
as signifying “Diminuta lacte camela, pulli
septimestris mater,” as on the authority of the
KL, is a mistake for شَائِلَةٌ.]
[
أَشْبَلُ, expl. by Golius as signifying “Magno
veretri præputio camelus,” as on the authority of
the KL, is a mistake for أَثْيَلُ.]
مُشْبِلٌ A lioness whose whelps, or young ones,
accompany her, (S, O, Msb,) going with her.
(S, O.) And A she-camel whose young one has
become strong, and goes with her. (AZ, S, O.)
―
-b2-  See also 4.
مَشْبُولٌ A place in which are lions' whelps or
young ones. (Ham p. 416.)
