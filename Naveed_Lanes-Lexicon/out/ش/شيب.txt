شيب1
شَابَ, aor. يَشِيبُ, inf. n. شَيْبٌ and شَيْبَةٌ (Msb,
TA) and مَشِيبٌ, (TA,) He became whitehaired, or hoary. (Msb, TA.) And شاب
رَأْسُهُ (S,) and رَأْسُهَا, (Msb, TA,) inf. n. شَيْبٌ
and شَيْبَةٌ, (S,) His head, and her head, became
white, or hoary. (S, Msb, TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,]
شَابَتْ رُؤُوسُ الآكَامِ (tropical:)  [The heads, or summits, of
the hills became white, or hoary]. (A.)
-A2-  And
شاب الرَّأْسَ It whitened the head: so expl. by
ISk as used in the following saying, (S,) ascribed
by J to 'Adee, but it is of 'Abeed Ibn-El-Abras:
(IB, TA:)
تَصْبُو وَأَنَّى لَكَ التَّصَابِى
↓ وَالرَّأْسُ قَدْ شَابَهُ المَشِيبُ
[Thou inclinest to silly and youthful conduct: but
whence cometh to thee the inclining to such conduct when hoariness, or the entering upon the
period of hoariness, hath whitened the head?].
(S, * IB, TA.) [See also 2.]

شيّبهُ الحُزْنُ, (Ks, S, A,) and شيّب الحُزْنُ
رَأْسَهُ, and بِرَأْسِهِ, (Ks, S, Msb, K,) which last is
a strange phrase, as it exhibits together two means
by which a verb is rendered trans., [namely, the
doubling of the medial radical letter of the verb
and the introduction of the prep. بِ,] (TA,) Grief
rendered him white-headed, or hoary-headed; (Ks,
S, A, Msb, K;) as also ↓ اشابهُ, (A,) and ↓ اشاب
رَأْسَهُ and بِرَأْسِهِ. (Ks, S, Msb, K. *)

اشاب, said of a man, He had children that
had become white-headed, or hoary. (S, TA.)
-A2-
See also the next preceding paragraph, in two
places.
شَيْبٌ The hair (K, TA) itself: sometimes it is
thus called: (TA:) [but app. only when white,
or hoary; in which sense it is often used; as in
the TA in arts. خضب and صبغ &c.:] or (K, TA,
in the CK “ and ”) whiteness of the hair, or
hoariness; (A, K, TA;) as also ↓ مَشِيبٌ: (K,
TA:) both signify the same [and are thus used as
simple substs. and are also inf. ns.]: (S:) or the
former has the latter of the two significations
given above; (As, S, Mgh, Msb;) and is little
and much [whiteness of the hair]: one says,
عَلَاهُ الشَّيْبُ [Whiteness of the hair, or hoariness,
came upon him]: (TA:) but ↓ مَشِيبٌ signifies a
man's entering upon the period of whiteness of
the hair, or hoariness: (As, S, Msb:) see an ex.
of this latter in the first paragraph. In the phrase
in the Kur [xix. 3], وَاشْتَعَلَ الرَّأْسُ شَيْبًا, (S,) meaning And whiteness of the hair of the head hath
spread therein like as the radiance of fire spreads
in firewood, (Jel,) [or the head has become
glistening with whiteness of the hair, or hoariness,]
شيبا is in the accus. case as a specificative: or,
accord. to Akh, as an inf. n., as though it were
said وَشَابَ الرَّأْسُ شَيْبًا. (S, TA. *)
شِيبٌ, of a whip, a genuine Arabic word of wellknown meaning; (S;) The thong (K, TA) at
the upper extremity (TA) of a whip: (K, TA:)
there are two of such thongs, called شِيبَانِ. (TA.)
-A2-  Also A word imitative of the sounds made by
the lips of camels (S, K) in drinking. (S.)
-A3-  And
pl. of أَشْيَبُ [q. v.]. (S, K, &c.)
شُيُبٌ a pl. of which the sing. is doubted: see
أَشْيَبُ.
شَيْبَةٌ an inf. n. of 1 [q. v.]. (S, Msb.) ―
-b2-  And
accord. to El-Khafájee, A white, or hoary, beard:
but MF says that this is a conventional postclassical meaning. (TA.)
-A2-  [Also, in the present
day, applied to A species of artemisia; (Forskål's
Flor. Aegypt. Arab., p. lxxiii., no. 439;) the
artemisia arborescens of Linn.: (Delile's Flor.
Aegypt. Illustr., no. 799:) ―
-b2-  and Lichen;
(Forskål ubi suprà;) the lichen prunastri of Linn.
(Delile, ib., no. 976 (assumed tropical:) .) And شَيْبَةُ الجَبَلِ Lichen
scyphifer. (Forskål, p. lxxviii., no. 559.)]
شَيْبَانُ: see أَشْيَبُ; near the end of the paragraph:
―
-b2-  and see also the paragraph here following.
شِيبَانُ and مِلْحَانُ, (S, A,) thus in a verse of
El-Kumeyt, as related by Ibn-Selemeh, with
kesr to the ش and م, (S,) or the former word is
written ↓ شَيْبَانُ, and sometimes شِيبَانُ, and the
latter is as above, (K,) and sometimes مَلْحَانُ,
(TA,) (tropical:)  The two months of winter; (A, TA;)
[as though meaning the second of the Six Seasons,
commencing two months after the autumnal
equinox; (see the former of the two tables in p.
1254;)] i. q. شَهْرَا قِمَاحٍ, (S, A, K, TA,) which are
the two coldest months; (S, K, TA;) so called
because of the earth's being then white with snow
and hoar frost; (S, TA;) falling at the period of
the [auroral] rising of the Scorpion and the
Vulture, (العَقْرَب and النَّسْر, [by which latter is
meant النَّسْرُ الوَاقِعُ, i. e. the star a of Lyra,])
said by him who knows not to be the two Kánoons
[i. e. كَانُونُ الأَوَّلُ and كَانُونُ الثَّانِى, corresponding
to December and January O.S.]: (TA:) [it
appears that they nearly agree with the two
Kánoons; for El-Kazweenee and others say that
القَلْبُ (i. e. the heart of the Scorpion, which is
the 18th of the Mansions of the Moon,) and
النَّسْرُ الوَاقِعُ rise together, and their auroral rising
in Central Arabia, about the commencement of
the era of the Flight, accord. to my calculation,
(see مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ in art. نزل,) was on the 25th of
November O. S.: see also مِلْحَانُ, and قِمَاحٌ:
it is also said that] شِيبَانُ [used alone] is a name
of [the month] كانون الاوّل, because of the whiteness of the earth by reason of the hoar-frost and
snow. (Mgh.)
شِيَابٌ and شِيَابَةٌ [the former erroneously written
by Golius شَيَّابٌ]: see شَوْبٌ, in art. شوب.
شَيُوبٌ: see أَشْيَبُ.
شَائِبٌ [Being, or becoming, white-haired, or
hoary]: see أَشْيَبُ. ―
-b2-  شَيْبٌ شَائِبٌ is a phrase like
لَيْلٌ لَائِلٌ, (S,) or like شِعْرٌ شَاعِرٌ: it means Intense
whiteness of the hair. (TA.)
أَشْيَبُ White-haired, white-headed, or horary:
(S, A, Mgh, Msb, K:) [it is said to be] anomalous
in form; (S, Mgh, Msb;) for an epithet of this
measure is only formed [by rule] from a verb of
the measure فَعِلَ, aor. يَفْعَلُ; (S, TA;) and it is
a condition of the formation of such an epithet
that it must denote a defect or the like, or a
colour: but أَشْيَبُ signifies white-headed, or hoaryheaded; [so that it does denote a colour;] and ElKhafájee says that it is reckoned among epithets
denoting defects, or blemishes, like أَعْمَى and
أَعْرَجُ: (MF, TA:) it is said in the K that it has
no فَعْلَآء, i. e., (TA,) the epithet شَيْبَآءُ is not applied
to a woman; (Msb, TA;) شَمْطَآءُ being used in its
stead; (TA;) though one says شَابَ رَأْسُهَا: (Msb,
TA:) [but see Har p. 418, where شَيْبَآءُ is mentioned, applied to a woman, as meaning aged, and
white, or hoary, in the head: and see شَيْبَآءُ in art.
شوب:] the pl. is شِيبٌ; (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K;)
with which is syn. شُيَّبٌ; (TA, as from the K;
[but not found by me in the copies of the K to
which I have had access;]) and ↓ شُيُبٌ: (K,
TA:) this last is said by IM to be allowable in
poetry, عَلَى التَّمَامِ [here meaning as though it
were a word composed of sound letters]; and this
is the assertion of the lexicologists [in general]:
ISd thinks it to be pl. of ↓ شَائِبٌ [q. v.], like as
بُزُلٌ is of بَازِلٌ; or pl. of ↓ شَيُوبٌ [which app. means
very white or hoary in the head], accord. to the
dial. of the people of El-Hijáz, who say دَجَاجَةٌ
بَيُوضٌ and دَجَاجٌ بُيُضٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] one
says, رَأَيْتُ الجِبَالَ شِيبًا (tropical:)  I saw the mountains
white with snow and hoar frost. (A, TA.) And
شِيبٌ [used alone] signifies (assumed tropical:)  Mountains upon
which snow falls, and which are white, or hoary,
therewith: (S, L:) or mountains white with snow
or with dust: and, some say, white clouds: sing.
أَشْيَبُ. (L, TA.) And, applied to truffles (كَمْأَة),
(assumed tropical:)  White and large: (TA:) or simply white. (Id.
voce تَعَاشِيبُ.) ―
-b3-  يَوْمٌ أَشْيَبُ (assumed tropical:)  A day in which are
cold and clouds and صُرَاد [correctly صُرَّاد, meaning
thin clouds, or cold and humid clouds, in which
is no water]; as also ↓ يَوْمٌ شَيْبَانُ. (K.) ―
-b4-  لَيْلَةُ
الشَّيْبَآءِ, (K,) or لَيْلَةُ شَيْبَآءَ, (TA,) and لَيْلَةٌ شَيْبَآءُ,
(TA voce حُرٌّ,) (assumed tropical:)  The last night of the [lunar]
month: (K, TA:) its first night is called لَيْلَةُ
حُرَّةٍ and لَيْلَةٌ حُرَّةٌ. (K voce حُرٌّ.) بَاتَتْ بِلَيْلَةِ شَيْبَآءَ,
and بِلَيْلَةِ الشَّيْبَآءِ: see in art. شوب.
مَشِيبٌ: see شَيْبٌ, in two places.
