شتم1
شَتَمَهُ, (MA, Msb, K,) aor.
شَتِمَ (Msb, K)
and
شَتُمَ, (K,) inf. n. شَتْمٌ (S, MA, Msb, K) and
مَشْتَمَةٌ and مَشْتُمَةٌ, (K, TA,) the last of these
[written مَشْتِمَة in the CK] with damm to the ت,
or this and the next before it, though said to be
inf. ns., may be simple substantives, as A'Obeyd
inclines to think them, (TA,) He reviled him,
vilified him, upbraided him, reproached him,
defamed him, or gave a bad name to him; (S, *
MA, K, TA;) syn. سَبَّهُ: (K, TA:) or, as some
say, شَتْمٌ signifies [the addressing with] foul
speech, without قَذْف [here meaning the casting
an accusation, though commonly used and expl.
as syn. with شَتْمٌ]: (TA:) and ↓ شاتمهُ signifies
the same as شَتَمَهُ, (MA, Msb,) being a rare instance of a verb of the measure فَاعَلَ denoting an
act of a single agent when it has an unaugmented
verb of the same radical letters [and the same
signification], as صَادَمَهُ الحِمَارُ meaning صَدَمَهُ,
and زَاحِمَهُ meaning زَحَمَهُ. (Msb.) Hence the
saying, فَإِنْ شُتِمَ فَلْيَعُلْ إِنِّى صَائِمٌ [And if he be
reviled, let him say, Verily I am fasting], which
may mean that he should say this with his tongue,
which is the more proper meaning, or mentally:
or ↓ فَإِنْ شُوتِمَ, which is allowable, though the
former is the more proper. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  شاتمهُ
فَشَتَمَهُ: see 3.
-A2-  شَتُمَ, aor.
شَتُمَ, (S, K,) inf. n. شَتَامَةٌ
(S, IB) and شَتَمٌ, (IB, TA,) (assumed tropical:)  He (a man, S)
was, or became, displeasing, or hateful, in countenance. (S, K.)
-A3-  [شَتِمَ, trans. by means of ب,
expl. by Golius as meaning He rejoiced at evils,
or misfortunes, of an enemy, is, I doubt not, a
mistake for شَمِتَ; though it might be supposed
to be formed by transposition, like جَبَذَ from
جَذَبَ.]
2
شتّم, accord. to Reiske, said of a camel
when haltered, and of a lion, as mentioned by
Freytag, signifies (assumed tropical:)  He was harsh, and surly, in
countenance, and uttered a grumbling sound: if
used, it must be شُتِّمَ, agreeably with the part. n.,
expl. below.]
3
مُشَاتَمَةٌ is syn. with مُسَابَّةٌ, (S,) signifying
The reviling, vilifying, upbraiding, reproaching,
defaming, or giving a bad name to, each other:
(KL:) and [in like manner] ↓ تَشَاتُمٌ is syn. with
تَسَابٌّ, (S,) signifying as above [but used in relation to two persons and more than two]: (KL:)
you say, شَاتَمَا and ↓ تَشَاتَمَا meaning تَسَابَّا [They
reviled, vilified, &c., each other]: (K:) and
↓ تشاتموا They reviled, &c., one another; like
تَسَابُّوا. (MA.) [شاتمهُ may therefore be rendered
He reviled him, &c., being reviled, &c., by him:
but sometimes it is syn. with شَتَمَهُ:] see 1, in two
places. ―
-b2-  One says also, ↓ شَاتَمَهُ فَشَتَمَهُ, aor.
شَتُمَ,
meaning [He vied, or contended, with him in
reviling, vilifying, &c.,] and he overcame him
[therein, i. e.] in reviling, &c. (TA.)
5
تشتّم is said by Freytag to signify He exposed himself to contumelies; on the authority of
the Ham p. 310: but I there find only the part. n.,
مُتَشَتِّمٌ, signifying as expl. below: so that the
verb, if used, means he became exasperated by
reviling, vilifying, &c., and addressed, or applied,
himself thereto. ―
-b2-  He also explains it as signifying (assumed tropical:)  He contracted the face very austerely; on
the authority of the Deewán of the Hudhalees.]
6
تَشَاْتَمَ see 3, in three places.
شِتَامٌ: see the next paragraph.
شَتِيمٌ: see مَشْتُومٌ. ―
-b2-  Also (assumed tropical:)  Displeasing, or
hateful, in countenance; (S, K;) applied to a
man, and to a lion; (S;) and to an ass, as meaning thus, and foul, or ugly: (TA:) or to a lion
as meaning (tropical:)  grim-faced; or stern, austere, or
morose, in countenance; as also ↓ مُشَتَّمٌ; and
↓ شَتَّامَةٌ; (K, TA;) the last like جَبَّانَةٌ [in measure, but in the CK written شَتامَة]. (TA.) One
says, فُلَانٌ شَتِيمُ المُحَيَّا (assumed tropical:)  Such a one is displeasing,
or hateful, in countenance. (S.)
-A2-  Also, and
↓ شِتَامٌ, An obstruction (سُدَّة) of the fauces, combined with foulness, or ugliness, of face. (TA.)
شَتِيمَةٌ a subst., (S, Msb, K, and Ksh in lxxiv.
41, [by Bd, in explaining the same passage of the
Kur, improperly said to be an inf. n.,]) from
شَتَمَهُ, (Msb, K,) in the sense of شَتْمٌ [meaning
The act of reviling, vilifying, or upbraiding; reproach, obloquy, or contumely]; (S, * and Ksh
ubi suprà;) as also ↓ مَشْتَمَةٌ, and ↓ مَشْتُمَةٌ, or, as
mentioned above, [see 1, first sentence,] these two
are inf. ns. (TA.)
شَتَّامٌ [One who reviles, &c., much]. (Ham p.
310.)
شَتَّامَةٌ One who reviles, &c., [very] much. (TA.)
―
-b2-  See also شَتِيمٌ.
[
شَاتِمٌ act. part. n. of 1, Reviling, &c. ―
-b2-  It is
also said by Golius, on the authority of the Mirkát
el-Loghah, to signify Rejoicing at another's evils,
or misfortunes: but this I believe to be a mistake
for شَامِتٌ: see 1, last sentence.]
الاشتيام, with kesr, [which seems to indicate
that it is الإِشْتِيَامُ,] is expl. by IB as meaning
رئيس الركاب [app. رَئِيسُ الرُّكَّابِ The headman,
or master, of the riders: but whence this is
derived I know not, unless it be arabicized, from
the Pers. أُسْتَا يَام (if there be such an appellation),
meaning “ the master of the post-horse ”]. (TA.)
مَشْتَمَةٌ and مَشْتُمَةٌ: see شَتِيمَةٌ.
مُشَتَّمٌ: see شَتِيمٌ; and see also مُشَبَّمٌ.
مَشْتُومٌ Reviled, vilified, upbraided, reproached,
defamed, or called by a bad name: and so with
ة applied to a female, as also ↓ شَتِيمٌ; (K, TA;)
this last, without ة, mentioned on the authority
of Lh. (TA.)
مُتَشَتِّمٌ Exasperated by reviling, &c., and addressing, or applying, himself thereto. (Ham
p. 310: there expl. by the words متحكك بالشتم
ومعترض له [i. e. مُتَحَكِّكٌ بِالشَّتْمِ وَمُعْتَرِضٌ لَهُ:
see 5].)
