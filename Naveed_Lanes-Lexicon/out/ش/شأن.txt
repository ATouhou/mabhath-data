شأن1
شَأَنْتُ شَأْنَهُ i. q. قَصَدْتُ قَصْدَهُ [meaning I
pursued his (another's) way, or course, doing as
he did]; (S, L, K: * in the K, شَأَنَ شَأْنَهُ and
قَصَدَ قَصْدَهُ;) and in like manner one says,
شَأْنَهُ ↓ اشتأن. (K.) ―
-b2-  And اِشْأَنْ شَأْنَكَ Do thou
what thou dost well. (S, L, K. *) And Keep thou
to thy affair. (IAar, L.) ―
-b3-  And مَا شَأَنَ شَأْنَهُ
He did not know, or had not knowledge of, him,
or his affair or case or state: (Lh, IAar, L, K:)
[from a passage in the L, imperfectly written, it
seems, accord. to Lh, to be said of one who does
what another likes or dislikes, app. without
regard to his liking it or disliking it, agreeably
with what here follows:] or (K) this means, (S,
K,) or means also, (L,) he did not care for,
mind, heed, or regard, him. (S, L, K. [In the S
and L, the verb in the sense thus expl. is in the
first pers.: and in one place in the L it is expl.
by أَرَادَ, which often has this meaning.]) One
says also, لَأَشْأَننَّ شَأْنَهُمْ, meaning I will assuredly
know, or try, prove, or test, (لَأَخْبُرَنَّ,) their
affair or case or state: (L:) or this means I
will assuredly corrupt, or pervert, or mar, their
affair or case or state: (S, L, K: *) and لَأَشْأَنَنَّ
خَبَرَهُ, (L,) or خَبَرَهُمْ, (K,) means I will assuredly
know, or try, prove, or test, [his, or their, state,
or] him, or them. (L, K. [In the CK and in my
MS. copy of the K, لَاُخْبِرَنَّهُمْ, is erroneously put for
لَأَخْبُرَنَّهُمْ.])
-A2-  شَأَنَ بَعْدَكَ means صَارَ لَهُ شَأْنٌ [i. e.,
app., He became a person to whom importance
attached (accord. to the general meaning of لَهُ
شَأْنٌ) after thou knewest, or sawest, or mettest,
him; بَعْدَكَ being for بَعْدَ عَهْدِكَ بِهِ, agreeably
with common usage]. (K.)

اشأن شَأْنَهُمْ is mentioned by Golius as
meaning “ Corrupit ac pervertit rem eorum,”
as on the authority of the S, (the right reading in
which has been given above,) and on that of the
KL, in my copy of which I find nothing of the
sort.]

إِشْتَاَ^َ see 1, first sentence.
شَأْنٌ A thing, an affair, or a business; syn.
أَمْرٌ; (S, L, K;) and خَطْبٌ [in the same sense,
or in that next following]: (L, K:) a great
thing or affair: (Har p. 274:) state, condition,
case, quality, or manner of being; syn. حَالٌ: (S,
L:) [also property, or nature: and importance
attaching to a person or thing:] pl. شُؤُونٌ and
شِئَانٌ, (L, K,) the latter mentioned by IJ on the
authority of AAF, and شُونٌ occurs in poetry for
the former of these, or as another pl. originally
شُؤْنٌ, of the measure فُعْلٌ. (L.) It is said in the
Kur [lv. 29], كُلَّ يَم ٍ هُوَ فِى شَأْن ٍ [Every day
He is employing Himself in an affair of some
kind]: expl. as meaning that, of his business
(مِنْ شَأْنِهِ [which may also be rendered “ of his
property ”]) it is to render mighty one who is
brought low, and to bring low one who is
mighty, and to enrich one who is poor, and to
impoverish one who is rich; and no affair occupies him so as to divert him from an affair
(لَا يَشْعَلُهُ شَأْنٌ عَنْ شَأْن ٍ). (L.) [And one says,
مَا شَأْنُكَ What is thy affair? or what is thy case?
And شَأْنَكَ, for اِشْأَنْ شَأْنَكَ i. e. Pursue thy way
or course, or thy affair; or do what thou dost
well; or keep to thy affair: or the like: and to
this is often added, وَمَا تُرِيدُ i. e. and what thou
wilt, or wishest, or desirest. And مِنْ شَأْنِهِ أَنْ
يَفْعَلَ كَذَا It is of his business, or of his property, or nature, to do, or that he should do, such
a thing. And رَجُلٌ سَهْلُ الشَّأْنِ (a phrase occurring in the S and K in art. هش) A man of easy
nature. And لَهُ شَأْنٌ, sometimes meaning There
is for him, or he has, a great thing or affair to
perform or transact: but more commonly, great
importance attaches to him, or to it: see 1, last
sentence. And a grandee, or a prince, is said to
be عَظِيمُ الشَّأْنِ i. e. Of great importance or rank
or dignity.]
-A2-  Also [A suture of the skull; i. e.]
the place of junction of the قَبَائِل [or principal
bones, namely, the frontal, occipital, and two
parietal, bones,] of the head: (K:) sing. of
شُؤُونٌ, (Mgh,) which signifies the places of
junction, (As, S, Mgh, L,) and of meeting, (S,
L,) of the قَبَائِل (As, S, Mgh, L) of the head;
(S, L;) between every two of which قبائل is a
شَأْن: (As, L:) [it is fancifully said that] from
them come the tears: (As, S, L:) the pl. is also
expl. as meaning the سَلَاسِل [i. e. sutures as being
likened to the سلاسل (or lines) of writing] that
unite the قبائل: by Lth, as the نَمَانِم [likewise
meaning sutures resembling lines of writing] of
the skull; between the قبائل: by AHát, as the
شُعَب [meaning serrated edges] that unite the
قبائل of the head. (L.) ―
-b2-  And The channel by
which the tears flow, or run, to the eye: pl. [of
pauc.] أَشْؤُنٌ and [of mult.] شُؤُونٌ: (L, K:)
[perhaps thus called because supposed to come
from the sutures of the skull: but they may have
been supposed to come thence because tears are
called مَآءُ الشُّؤُونِ (as in a verse cited voce رَسَمَ);
for this phrase may have been misunderstood as
signifying “ the water of the sutures of the skull,”
whereas it seems to be properly rendered “ the
water of the channels of the tears: ”] it is said
that the شُؤُون connect the قبائل of the head
[expl. above] to the eye: Lth says that they are
the ducts (عُرُوق) of the tears from [the interior
of] the head to the eye: and Th, that they are
certain ducts (عروق) above the قبائل, which
become strong by degrees as the man advances in
age: (L: [but it seems that Th has confounded
explanations of شؤون in two different senses:])
accord. to ISk, (S,) or AA and others, (L,) the
شَأْنَانِ are two ducts (عِرْقَانِ) descending from [the
upper part of] the head to the eyebrows and then
to the eyes. (S, L.) ―
-b3-  [The pl. شُؤُونٌ is also
expl. as though meaning Tears themselves, in a
phrase mentioned voce ذَئِرٌ (q. v.), on the authority of the K.] ―
-b4-  And شُؤُونٌ الخَمْرِ means (assumed tropical:)  The
effluvia of wine that creep (مَا دَبَّ مِنَ الخَمْرِ)
in the veins of the body. (L.) ―
-b5-  شَأْنٌ also signifies A vein of earth in a mountain, (L, K,) i. e.
a cleft therein, (L,) in which palm-trees are
planted; (L, K;) or in which trees of the kind
called نَبْع grow; or that produces plants, or herbage: (L:) pl. شُؤُونٌ: (L, K:) which is said
by ISd to mean lines, or streaks, in a mountain:
or, as some say, cracks, or clefts: and to these
cracks, or clefts, the poet Keys Ibn-Kuráa likens
[imaginary] clefts in the liver, occasioned by
love. (L.)
إِنَّهُ لَمِشْأَنُ شَأْن ٍ أَنْ نُفْسِدَكَ is a saying mentioned by Lh, expl. [only] by the words اى ان
نعمل فى فسادك [i. e. أَنْ نَعْمَلَ فِى فَسَادِكَ, app.
meaning Verily he is busying himself in the doing
of a thing in order that we may labour in causing
thee to be in a bad, or corrupt, state]. (L.)
