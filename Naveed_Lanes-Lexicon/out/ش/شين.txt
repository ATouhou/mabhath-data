every evening, with the crooked things (i. e. the
bows) of the wood of the tree called سَرَآء, at a
veiled door, (referring to a company of men, and
therefore the verb is sing.,)] means that they vie,

make marks, or lines, with their bows, upon the
ground, as though they disfigured it (شَانُوهَا) with
