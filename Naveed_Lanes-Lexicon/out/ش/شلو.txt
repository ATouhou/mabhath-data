IAar and several others, one says, أَشْلَيْتُ الكَلْبَ

[against the object, or objects, of the chase]; like

Msb, TA,) and by Th; (S, Mgh, TA;) and in
like manner, اشليتهُ بِالصَّيْدِ in the same sense;
though they are allowed by others: one says,
however, [by common consent,] أَشْلَيْتُ الكَلْبَ
لِلصَّيْدِ, meaning I called the dog to the chase.

him, or rescue him, (S, K,) or to make him come
forth, (S,) from straitness, or perdition, (K,) or
from a place: (S:) this is the primary signification. (TA.) ―

of such a one are remains among the sons of such
a one: (S, Msb:) and هُوَ مِنْ أَشْلَآءِ القَوْمِ (assumed tropical:)  He is

(assumed tropical:)  a remain, or remaining portion: and شلىّ [app.
شُلِىٌّ, said to be like غنىّ, but this is, I doubt not,
a mistranscription for عُنِىٌّ, i. e. originally of the
