شك1
شَكَّ is intrans. by itself, and trans. by means
of the particle فى: ―
-b2-  one says شَكَّ الأَمْرُ, aor.
يَشُكُّ [contr. to analogy in the case of an intrans.
verb of this class], inf. n. شَكٌّ, The thing, or case,
or affair, was, or became, dubious, or confused:
(Msb:) ―
-b3-  and شَكَّ فِيهِ, (MA, K,) first pers.
شَكَكْتُ فيه, (S, Msb,) aor. as above, (JM, PS,
&c.,) and so the inf. n., (MA, &c.,) He doubted,
wavered or vacillated in opinion, or was uncertain, respecting it; (MA, Msb, and so accord. to
explanations of شَكٌّ [q. v. infrà] in the S and
Msb and K &c.;) syn. اِرْتَابَ; (Msb;) and
↓ تشكّك signifies the same. (S, K.) ―
-b4-  شَكَّ عَلَىَّ
الأَمْرُ means شَقَّ [i. e. The case, or affair, was
difficult, hard, distressing, &c., to me]: (O, TA:)
or, as some say, [was such that] I doubted
(شَكَكْتُ) respecting it. (TA.)
-A2-  شَكَّ said of a
camel, (IAar, S, K,) aor. and inf. n. as above,
(S,) He limped, or halted; or had a slight lameness, (IAar, S, TA,) of his hind leg: (IAar,
TA:) or his arm stuck to his side, (K, TA,) and
he had a slight lameness in consequence thereof:
(TA:) and ↓ اشتكّ, likewise said of a camel, he
had a slight lameness; (Ibn-'Abbád, O, TA;)
like شَكَّ. (Ibn-'Abbád, O.) ―
-b2-  شَكٌّ also signifies
The cleaving or sticking [of a thing to another
thing]. (S, O, TA.) So in a verse of Aboo-Dahbal El-Jumahee cited voce يَلَبٌ. (S.) And
one says, شَكَّتِ الرَّحِمُ The relationship was, or
became, closely united. (O, TA. [See رَحِمٌ شَاكَّةٌ,
voce شَاكٌّ.]) ―
-b3-  شَكَّ فِى السِّلَاحِ, (K, TA,) aor.
and inf. n. as above, (TA,) He put on [or around
him,] or attired himself with, the arms, or weapons, completely, not leaving any of them; (TA;)
[as though] he entered amid them. (K, TA.)
-A3-
شَكَكْتُهُ بِالرُّمْحِ, (S, O, Msb, in the K شَكَّهُ,) and
بِالسَّهْمِ, and the like, aor. as above, (TA,) and so
the inf. n., (Msb, TA,) I pierced, or transpierced,
him, or it, (طَعَنْتُهُ, Msb, or خَزَقْتُهُ, O, and in like
manner in the TA, but in my copies of the S
خَرَقْتُهُ [meaning I made a hole in him, or it],
and thus in one place in the TA, and اِنْتَظَمْتُهُ, S
O, and in like manner in the K,) with the spear,
(S, O, Msb, K,) and with the arrow, &c.: (TA:)
but IDrd says that, accord. to some, شَكٌّ is only
by the conjoining two things with an arrow or a
spear: (O, TA:) [thus,] فَشَكَّ رِجْلَهُ مَعَ رِكَابِهِ
means And he clave and transpierced his leg, or
foot, together with his stirrup. (Mgh.) ―
-b2-
[Hence,] شَكَكْتُ إِلَيْهِ البِلَادَ I traversed, or crossed,
or cut through, the countries, or districts, to him.
(O, TA.) ―
-b3-  And شُكَّ عَلَيِه الثَّوْبُ The garment
was put [or drawn] together upon him, and
fastened with a thorn or a wooden pin: or was
let down, or made to hang down, upon him. (TA.)
―
-b4-  شَكُّوا بُيُوتَهُمْ They placed their tents in one
row, or series, (O, Msb, K,) in one regular order,
(T, TA,) near together. (Msb.) ―
-b5-  Hence; شَكُّوا
الأَرْحَامَ They made the relationships to be closely
connected. (Msb.) And شُكَّ He was made, or
asserted, to be connected with the lineage of
another. (IAar, O.) ―
-b6-  And شَكَكْتُهُ said of anything means I drew and joined, or adjoined, it
[to another thing]. (Msb.) [And I infixed it
in, or thrust it into, another thing.] ―
-b7-  مَا شَكَّ
كَفِى خَلِيلُهَا, [or, more probably, ما شُكَّ,] a
phrase in a verse of El-Farezdak,] in which it
forms an apodosis,] means مَا قَارَنَ [i. e., app., Its
friend (the sword, or the spear, both of which
are meanings of الخَلِيل,) would not be conjoined
(or grasped) with my hand]. (TA.) ―
-b8-  شَكَّ
الثَّوْبَ He (the sewer) made the stitch-holes far
apart [in sewing the garment, or piece of cloth].

of the K شَكَكْتُهُ and اليه,) I inclined to him, or
it; or trusted to, or relied upon, him, or it, so as
to be, or become, easy, or quiet, in mind; or
leaned, rested, or relied, upon him, or it; syn.

إِشْتَكَ3َ see the first paragraph.
شَكٌّ [used as a subst.] signifies Doubt; (Msb;
[see 1;]) or the contr. of يَقِينٌ; (S, O, Msb, K;)
by which explanation is meant a wavering or
vacillation in opinion between two things, whether
they be equal [in probability] or such that one of
them outweighs [therein] the other; or, as the
expositors explain its meaning in the Kur x. 94,
uncertainty: (Msb:) or a wavering or vacillation in opinion, between two inconsistent things,
without making either of them to outweigh the
other in the estimation of him who conceives the
شَكّ: or, as some say, a pausing, or hesitation,
between two extremes that are equal [in probability], without the mind's inclining to either of
them: when one of them is made to outweigh,
without the other's being rejected, it is ظَنٌّ:
(KT:) accord. to Er-Rághib, it is the alternation,
or confusedness, of two inconsistent things, in the
judgment of a man, and their being equal: this is
sometimes because of there being two indications,
equal in his judgment, of the two inconsistent
things; or of there being no indication thereof:
and sometimes it relates to the question whether a
thing be, or be not; and sometimes, to the question
of what kind it is; and sometimes, to some of its
qualities; and sometimes, to the accident that is
the cause of its being: it is a species of جَهْل; but
is more special than this; for جهل is sometimes
the utter nonexistence of knowledge of the two
inconsistent things; so that every شكّ is جهل,
but every جهل is not شكّ: (TA:) accord. to
some, the primary meaning is a state of commotion, or disturbance, of the heart and mind:
(Msb:) pl. شُكُوكٌ. (K.) ―
-b2-  [Hence, يَوْمُ الشَّكِ
The day of which one doubts whether it be the
last of one month or the first of the next month:
and generally, whether it be the last of Shaabán
or the first of Ramadán; and to fast on this day
is forbidden.]
-A2-  Also A small crack in a bone.
(K.) ―
-b2-  And A seam, or line of sewing, of a
garment. (L in art. صوح.) ―

-b2-  And Natural
disposition; syn. خُلُقٌ. (TK, as from the K.
[The only reading that I find in copies of the K

the TK.])

and شَاكٌّ فِى السِّلَاحِ [A man completely armed]:
the former expl. as meaning a man wearing a
complete set of arms, or weapons: [pl. شُكَّاكٌ,
agreeably with analogy:] you say قَوْمٌ شُكَّاكٌ فِى
الحَدِيدِ [a people, or party, completely clad in
sets of iron arms or weapons]. (S, O. [In one
of my copies of the S, بِالحَدِيدِ.]) [Accord. to
the TA, one says مِنْ قَوْمٍ شُكَّاكٍ ↓ رَجُلٌ شَكَّاكٌ: but

بِالسَّيْفِ عَنْ حَامِى الحَقِيقَةِ مُعْلَمِ
(O, TA:) [but in the EM it is مَسَكِّ, thus with
س, and with fet-h to the م; a word which I do
not find in any lexicon: it is said that] مسك
signifies a coat of mail narrow in the rings: and
the poet means, And of many an ample coat of
mail [narrow in the rings] have I rent open the

who was the defender of those who, or that which,
it was his duty to defend, who was pointed to as
being the cavalier of the army. (EM p. 243.)
