(Msb, K,) like as the rider of the horse does with
his horse: (Msb:) and ↓ اشنقهُ signifies the same:
(S, M, Msb, K:) or ↓ اشنق is intrans.; you say,

rule; (IJ, M;) or the latter is intrans. also; (S,
Msb, K;) signifying he (the camel) raised his
head. (S, M, Msb, K. *) ―

CK, أَوْكَأَها is erroneously put for أَوْكَاهَا, or, as
in some copies of the K, وَكَاهَا:]) or he suspended
it: and [in like manner] القِرْبَةَ ↓ اشنق, inf. n. as
above, he suspended the water-skin to a peg:
(TA:) or the latter signifies he put a شِنَاق to the
water-skin: (M:) or he bound the water-skin
with a شِنَاق, (S, K, TA,) i. e. a cord with which
its mouth is bound. (S.) ―

meaning (assumed tropical:)  He hanged him by the neck, till he
died: (see the pass. part. n., below:) whence

and with it raised a portion of the honey-comb in

شينق beneath it; and sometimes two portions of
the honey-comb, and three: (M: [accord. to which
one says also, شَنَقَ فِى الخَلِيَّةِ القُرْصَيْنِ وَالثَّلَاثَةَ:])
this is done only when the bees are rearing their
young ones. (M, K. *) ―
-b8-  Accord. to Aboo-Sa'eed,
الشَّىْءَ ↓ أَشْنَقْتُ and شَنَقْتُهُ signify the same: (TA:
[in which the meaning is not expl.; but it is immediately added, app. to indicate the meaning
here intended;]) El-Mutanakhkhil El-Hudhalee
says, describing a bow and arrows,
شَنَقْتُ بِهَا مَعَابِلَ مُرْهَفَاتٍ
i. e. I put its string into [the notches of] arrows

(O:) or شَنَقٌ signifies the heart's yearning towards, or longing for, or desiring, a thing.
(Msb.)
-A3-  شَنَقٌ also signifies The being long:
(M:) or the being long in the head, (JK, S, TA,)
as though it were stretched upwards: (TA:) one
says of a horse, شَنِقَ inf. n. شَنَقٌ, meaning He
was long in the head. (JK.) ―
-b2-  شَنَقُ المَرْأَةِ, signifies اِسْتِنَانُهَا مِنَ الشَّحْمِ [app. meaning The woman's
becoming sleek, like مَسَانّ (or whetstones) by
reason of fat: see اِسْتَنَّتِ الفِصَالُ, in art. سن]:
and the epithet applied to her is ↓ شَنِقَةٌ, pl. شَنِقَاتٌ.
(JK, Ibn-' Abbád, O, TA.)
2
شنّق الخَلِيَّةَ, inf. n. تَشْنِيقٌ: see 1, in the latter
half of the paragraph. ―
-b2-  تَشْنِيقٌ also signifies The
cutting [a thing] in pieces. (O, K. [See the

شانقهُ, inf. n. مُشَانَقَةٌ and شِنَاقٌ, He mixed
his cattle with his [i. e. another's] cattle: (K,
TA:) this is when [contributions to the poor-rate
such as are termed] أَشْنَاق [pl. of شَنَقٌ] are incumbent on a man, or two men, or three, when their
cattle are separate, and one says to another,
شَانِقْنِى, i. e. Mix thou my cattle and thy cattle;
for if they are separate, a شَنَق will be obligatory,
or incumbent, on each of us; and if they are
mixed, the case will be light to us: so the شِنَاق
signifies the sharing in the شَنَق or in the شَنَقَانِ.
(L, TA.) [See also what follows in this paragraph:
and see شَنَقٌ.] One says also ↓ لَا تَشَانَقُوا [for
لَا تَتَشَانَقُوا] Ye shall not put together what are
separate [of cattle]; التَّشَانُقُ being syn. with
المُشَانَقَةُ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  شِنَاقٌ signifies also The taking
somewhat from the شَنَق: and hence the trad.,
لَا شِنَاقَ: (K, TA:) this means There shall not be
taken from the شَنَق [any contribution to the poorrate] unless it is complete [in number]: (A' Obeyd,
S, TA:) the شَنَق being, of camels, such as exceed
five, up to ten; and what exceed ten, up to
fifteen: (A 'Obeyd, TA:) Aboo-Sa'eed Ed-Dareer
says, up to nine; and up to fourteen: but this is
pronounced in the L to be wrong: (TA:) [Mtr
also says,] it means there shall not be taken aught
of what exceed five, up to nine, for example: or,
accord. to Aboo-Sa'eed Ed-Dareer, it is like the
mixing; but this requires consideration: (Mgh:)
Aboo-Sa'eed says that لَا شِنَاقَ means a man shall
not adjoin (↓ لَا يُشْنِقُ [thus written here and thus
expl. in the TA]) his sheep or goats, and his
camels, to the sheep or goats [and the camels] of
another person, in order to annul what is obligatory, or incumbent, on him, of the poor-rate:
this is [for instance] in the case in which each of
them has forty sheep or goats; so that it is incumbent on them to give two sheep or goats;
but when one of them adjoins (أَحَدُهُمَا ↓ فَإِذَا شَنَّقَ
[thus in this instance in the TA, perhaps a mistranscription for أَشْنَقَ,]) his sheep or goats to
those of another, and the collector of the poorrate finds them in his [the latter's] possession, he
takes from them one sheep or goat. (TA.)
4
اشنق: see 1, in five places. ―
-b2-  إِشْنَاقٌ [as
inf. n. of أُشْنِقَ, from أَشْنَقَ القِرْبَةَ expl. in the first
paragraph,] also signifies The having the hand
attached to the neck by means of a غُلّ [q. v.].
(AA, TA.) ―
-b3-  See also 3, in the latter half.
-A2-
Accord. to IAar, (O, TA,) اشنق also signifies
He took (O, K, TA) the شَنَق, i. e., (O, TA,) the
[fine termed] أَرْش: (O, K, TA:) or it was, or
became, obligatory, or incumbent, on him to give
the أَرْش; thus having two contr. meanings [assigned to it]: (K:) or it signifies also, accord. to
IAar, it was, or became, obligatory on him to give
what is termed a شَنَق; and this is the case until
his camels amount to five and twenty, when what
is due of them is [a she-camed such as is termed]
اِبْنَة مَخَاض. (O.) A man of the Arabs said,
مِنَّا مَنْ يُشْنِقُ, which may mean Of us is he who
gives the شُنُق, i. e. cords, pl. of شِنَاقٌ: or it may
mean, who gives the شَنَق, i. e. أَرْش. (O.) ―
-b2-
اشنق عَلَيْهِ He exalted himself above him; domineered over him; or oppressed him. (O, K.)
5
تشنّق He adorned himself; or was, or became, adorned: (JK, O:) and he clad himself
with garments. (JK.)

تَشَاْنَقَ see 3.
شَنَقٌ What is between one فَرِيضَة and the next
فَرِيضَة, (A'Obeyd, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K, TA,)
[meaning a number that is between two other
numbers whereof each imposes the obligation of
giving a due termed فَرِيضَة,] of camels, and of
sheep or goats, (M, TA,) in relation to the poorrate: (S, Mgh, K, TA:) so called because nothing
is taken therefrom; so that it is adjoined (أُشْنِقَ
i. e. أَضِيفَ) to that [number] which is next to it
[of the numbers below it]: (JK:) accord. to
some, it is syn. with وَقَصٌ; (Mgh, Msb;) but
some say that it relates peculiarly to camels; (M,
Mgh, Msb;) and وَقَصٌ, to bulls and cows: (Mgh,
Msb:) used in relation to sheep or goats, it is
what is between forty and a hundred and twenty;
and in like manner as to other numbers [that
impose the obligation of giving a فريضة]: K,
TA:) Ahmad Ibn-Hambal is related to have said
that the شَنَق is what is above the فريضة, absolutely; as, for instance, what is above forty sheep
or goats: (TA: [I here render the word دُونَ
“ above,” though it also means “ below,” because
nothing is due from sheep or goats fewer than
forty:]) as A'Obeyd says, it is, of camels, such as
exceed five, up to ten; and what exceed ten, up to
fifteen: (O, * TA: [see also 3:]) Ks states, on
the authority of some one or more of the Arabs,
that it is up to twenty-five; and says that it is
what does pot impose the obligation of the فريضة;
meaning what is between five and twenty-five:
(Fr, TA:) [but it is also expl. as applied to the
due itself that is to be contributed to the poorrates for certain numbers of camels: thus] Aboo-
'Amr Esh-Sheybánee says, the شَنَق for five
camels is a sheep or goat; for ten, two sheep or
goats; for fifteen three sheep or goats; and for
twenty, four sheep or goats; the term شَنَقٌ being
applied alike to the sheep or goat, and to the two
sheep or goats, and to the three sheep or goats,
and to the four sheep or goats; what exceeds this
last being termed فَرِيضَةٌ: (TA:) or, in the case
of the poor-rate, the lowest شَنَق (الشَّنَقُ الأَسْفَلُ) is
a sheep or goat for five camels; and the highest
شَنَق (الشَّنَقُ الأَعْلَى) is a بِنْت مَخَاض for five and
twenty: (O, K:) the pl. of شَنَقٌ is أَشْنَاقٌ (M,
Msb, TA) and شِنَاقٌ. (M.) ―
-b2-  Also What is
above the bloodwit (مَا دُونَ الدِّيَةِ): (As, S, O,
Msb, K:) the term أَشْنَاق, (S, M, Msb,) pl. of
شَنَقٌ, (M,) being applied to the fines, for wounds,
that are sent with the complete bloodwit (S, M, *
O, Msb) by him upon whom rests the obligation
to send such; (S, O, Msb;) as though they were
attached to the main, or greatest, fine: (S, M, *
O:) and an addition, in the bloodwit, (M, Msb,)
of five, (M,) or of six, (M, Msb,) or of seven,
(Msb,) to the hundred camels [which constitute
the complete bloodwit], (M, Msb, *) in order that
it may be described as ample: (Msb:) [for,] as
IAar and As and El-Athram say, the man of
rank or quality, when he gave [the bloodwit],
used to add to it five [or more] camels, to show
thereby his excellence and his generosity: (TA:)
a redundancy [in the case of the bloodwit]; (O,
K;) one of the explanations of the term given by
As: (O:) or in the case of bloodwits (دِيَات), the
lowest شَنَق (الشَّنَقُ الأَسْفَلُ) is twenty camels whereof
every one is a بِنْت مَخَاض; and the highest شَنَق
(الشَّنَقُ الأَعْلَى) is twenty camels whereof every one
is a جَذَعَة: (O, K:) and some say that أَشْنَاقُ الدِّيَاتِ
means the sorts of bloodwits; the bloodwit for
purely-unintentional homicide being a hundred
camels, which those who are responsible for it
undertake to give in fifths, consisting of twenty
whereof every one is an اِبْنَة مَخَاض, and twenty
whereof every one is an اِبْنَة لَبُون, and twenty
whereof every one is an اِبْن لَبُون, and twenty
whereof every one is a حِقَّة, and twenty whereof
every one is a جَذَعَة; these also being termed
أَشْنَاق. (TA.) ―
-b3-  It signifies also A fine, or
mulct, for a wound or the like; (O, Msb, K;)
as, for instance, for a burn, (O, TA,) or such as
a wound on the head that lays bare the bone,
(Msb, TA,) and other wounds, (Msb,) and for a
tooth [knocked out], and for an eye blinded, and
for an arm or a hand vitiated, or rendered unsound and motionless, or stiff; and for anything
short of what requires the complete bloowit:
(TA:) or, as some say, a fine for that which does
not render obnoxious to retaliation; as a scratch,
or laceration of the skin, and the like: (M:) pl.
أَشْنَاقٌ. (M, Msb.)
-A2-  Also A burden borne on
one side of a beast, equiponderant to another
borne on the other side; syn. عِدْلٌ: (K, TA: [in
the CK and my MS. copy of the K, العَدْلُ is
erroneously put for العِدْل:]) الشَّنَقَانِ signifies
العِدْلَان. (JK, Ibn-' Abbád, O, TA. *) ―
-b2-  And A
rope, or cord. (Ibn-' Abbád, O, K.) ―
-b3-  And A
bow-string; (O, TA;) as also ↓ شِنَاقٌ; (O, K, *
TA;) so called because it is bound to the head
of the bow: (O, TA:) or, accord. to Sh, a good
bow-string, i. e. strong and long. (TA.) [See
what follows.]
-A3-  الشَّنَقُ also signifies العَمَلُ [The
making a thing]: (K:) thus accord. to some in
the saying of Ru-beh, describing a sportsman
[and his bow],
سَوَّى لَهَا كَبْدَآءَ تَنْزُو فِى الشَّنَقْ
[as though meaning He prepared for it, or them,
a bow such that the part whereby it was held
filled the hand, springing in the making by reason
of its elasticity and strength: but the word which
I have written تَنْزُو, and which is thus in one place
in the TA, and in another place in the same,
where the verse is repeated, تَنْزُوا, is illegible in
the copy of the O, and may be a mistranscription]:
accord. to others, however, the last word, الشَّنَقْ,
here means the bow-string. (O, TA.)
شَنِقٌ, applied to a heart, Loving intensely, or
very passionately or fondly; syn. هَيْمَانُ. (M,
TA.) Accord. to Lth, ↓ قَلْبٌ شَنِقٌ مِشْنَاقٌ signifies
طَامِحٌ إِلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ [app. meaning A heart
aspiring to everything]: (O, L, TA:) in the K,
قَلْبٌ شَنِقٌ كَكَتِفٍ مُشْتَاقٌ طَامِحٌ إِلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ;
but the right reading is قَلْبٌ شَنِقٌ مِشْنَاقٌ كَكَتِفٍ
وَمِحْرَابٍ, and the signification as above; primarily
relating to the eye. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Applied to a man,
Cautious; or fearful. (TA.) ―

a woman: see 1, last sentence.
