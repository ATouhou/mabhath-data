شنف1
شَنَفْتُ إِلَى الشَّىْءِ, (S,) aor.
شَنِفَ, (O, Msb,)
inf. n. شَنْفٌ, (S, O, K,) I looked in a state of opposition, or resistance, (فِى اعْتِرَاضٍ,) at the thing;
like شَفَنْتُ: (S, O: *) or الشَّنْفُ signifies the looking
at a thing, (O,) or the looking at a thing like him
who is opposing it, or resisting it, (كَالمُعْتَرِضِ عَلَيْهِ,
K, TA,) and the raising of the eyes in looking at
a thing, (TA,) like him who wonders at it, or
like him who dislikes it, or hates it; (O, K, TA;)
and so الشَّفْنُ, as AZ says. (TA.) [See also 2.]
-A2-  شَنِفَ لَهُ, (S, O, K,) and بِهِ also, or, correctly,
accord. to ISd, this verb is trans. in the sense
here next following without any particle, (TA,)
[but two exs. are cited in the O from trads. in
which it is trans. by means of ل,] aor.
شَنَفَ, (S, K,)
inf. n. شَنَفٌ, (S, O,) He hated him, (أَبْغَضَهُ,) and
met him in a morose manner: (S, O, K: [in the
K, the latter meaning is expressed by تَنَكَّرَهُ, for
تَنَكَّرَ لَهُ: in the S and O, the former meaning is
expressed as above, on the authority of ISk; and
it is also said that الشَّنْفُ is syn. with البُغْضُ and
التَّنَكُّرُ:] in the former of these two senses it is
like شَئِفَهُ, with ء: (S, O:) or الشنف [i. e. الشَّنَفُ]
is a subst. signifying vehemence of enmity. (Ham
p. 108.) ―
-b2-  And شَنِفَ لَهُ, (IAar, ISd, O, * K,
TA,) and بِهِ, (ISd, TA,) i. q. فَطِنَ [i. e. He
knew it; knew, had knowledge, or was cognizant,
of it; or knew it instinctively; &c.]. (IAar, ISd,
O, K, TA.)
-A3-  And شَنِفَ, (K, TA, [in the former
of which it is erroneously implied that the verb is
followed by لَهُ,]) His upper lip turned upwards;
(K, TA;) inf. n. شَنَفٌ; (TA;) or this is a subst.,
signifying a turning upwards of the upper lip:
so says AZ. (O.)
2
شَنَّفَهَا, inf. n. تَشْنِيفٌ, He adorned her (i. e.
a woman, S, or a girl, or young woman, O, K)
with the [ornament called] شَنْف; (S, O, K;) like
as one says, قَرَّطَهَا; (S, TA;) as also ↓ أَشْنَفَهَا.
(Zj, O, K.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] شَنَّفَ كَلَامَهُ وَقَرَّطَهُ (tropical:)  [He
adorned and embellished his language]. (TA.)
-A2-
شنّف إِلَيْهِ, inf. n. as above, He looked at him, or
it, from the outer corner of the eye. (Yaakoob,

تشنّفت She adorned herself with the [ornament called] شَنْف; (S, O, K;) like as one says,

شَنْفٌ (incorrectly pronounced with damm,
IDrd, O, K, i. e. شُنْفٌ, O, TA) The upper قُرْط
[i. e. ear-ring or ear-drop]: (S, O, K:) or a
pendant (مِعْلَاقٌ) in [or suspended from] the قُوف
[app. meaning the upper part, or perhaps, the
helix, in the CK erroneously written فَوْق,] of the
ear; (Lth, O, K;) and likewise such as is attached
to necklaces: (Lth, O:) or such as is suspended
from the upper part of the ear; what is suspended
from the lower part [or lobe] thereof being termed
قُرْطٌ; (IDrd, O, K;) or this latter is termed رُعْثَةٌ:
(IAar, TA:) or, as some say, i. q. قُرْطٌ: (TA:)
pl. [of mult.] شُنُوفٌ (IDrd, S, O, K) and [of
pauc.] أَشْنَافٌ. (TA.)
شَنِفٌ Hating, (S, O, K,) and meeting in a
morose manner. (K.) IB cites, as an ex.,
وَلَنْ تُدَاوِى عِلَّةَ القَلْبِ الشَّنِفْ
[And thou will not cure the hating heart]. (TA.)
شَفَةٌ شَنْفَآءُ [A lip, meaning an upper lip] turning
upwards: (O:) or شَاةٌ شَنْفَآءُ [A sheep or goat]
having the upper lip turning upwards. (TA.)
شَانِفٌ Turning away, or averse. (O, K.) One
says, مَا لِى أَرَاكَ شَانِفًا عَنِّى What ails me that I
see thee turning away, or averse, from me? (O.)
