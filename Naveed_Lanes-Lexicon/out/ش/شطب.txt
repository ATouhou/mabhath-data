شطب1
شَطَبَ, (K, TA,) aor.
شَطُبَ, (TA,) inf. n. شَطْبٌ,
(AZ, TA,) He cut (K, TA) into oblong pieces, or
strips, flesh-meat, and a camel's hump, and a
hide, or leather: (TA:) or he cut into strips, but
without separating them, a camel's hump. (AZ,
TA.) ―
-b2-  And شَطَبَتِ الجَرِيدَ, [aor.
شَطُبَ,] inf. n. شَطْبٌ,
She (a woman) split the palm-sticks, or palmbranches stripped of their leaves, to make of them
mats: which being done, says A'Obeyd, [or
when they have been peeled,] the شَاطِبَة [q.v.]
throws them to the مُنَقِّيَة. (S.) [Or] شَطَبَت,
aor.
شَطُبَ, inf. n. شُطُوبٌ, She removed the upper peel
of the شَطْب, or [fresh, green] palm-branches.
(ISk, TA.)
-A2-  شَطَبَ also signifies It inclined, or
declined, turned aside or away, deflected, or
deviated, and became distant, or remote; (As, O,
K;) and so شَطَفَ; and both signify it went
away. (As, TA.) One says, شَطَبَ عَنْهُ It turned
aside or away, and became distant, or remote,
from him, or it. (K.) Thus, in a trad., شَطَبَ
الرُّمْحُ عَنْ مَقْتَلِهِ The spear deflected from, and
failed to reach, his vital part. (O, TA. *) And
one says also, شَطَبَتِ الدَّارُ The dwelling was, or
became, distant, or remote. (O.)

انشطب It flowed; (S, K;) said of water,
&c. (K.)
شَطْبٌ pl. of ↓ شَطْبَةٌ, (S, Msb,) [or rather a
coll. gen. n., of which the latter is the n. un.,] like
as تَمْرٌ is of تَمْرَةٌ; (Msb;) Fresh, (A,) or green,
(Msb,) or green and fresh, (S, K,) palm-branches
(S, A, Msb, K) stripped of their leaves: (A:) or
they are less than what are termed شَطَائِبُ, of
which the sing. is ↓ شَطِيبَةٌ; and the شطائب are
less than the كَرَانِيف: [i. e. the كِرْنَاف is the
thickest part of the palm-branch; next is the
شَطِيبَة; and next to this, the شَطْبَة:] or ↓ شَطْبَةٌ
signifies a green palm-branch. (K.) كَمَسَلِّ
↓ شَطْبَةٍ, in a trad. of Umm-Zara, [as expl. in art.
سل, q. v.,] means Like a green palm-stick drawn
forth from its skin: or like a sword drawn forth
[from its scabbard]: (TA in art. سل:) [for] ―
-b2-
↓ شَطْبَةٌ signifies also A sword. (Aboo-Sa'eed,
K.) ―
-b3-  [Hence, app.,] شَطْبٌ is used also as an
epithet, meaning (tropical:)  Tall, and well made; (A, K,
TA;) applied to a man and to a horse. (TA.)
And, applied to a boy, or young man, (tropical:)  Plump;
or fat, soft, thin-skinned, and plump: and so
↓ شَطْبَةٌ applied to a girl, or young woman: (A:)
or the former, applied to a boy, or young man,
well made, and neither tall nor short: (TA:) or,
so applied, light, or active, in body, and sharpheaded: (IAar, TA in art. عضب, voce عَضْبٌ:)
or it means, so applied, long and even (سَبِطٌ) in
the bones, light of flesh; likened to the palm-stick
that is split: but this epithet is mostly used with
ة, i. e. ↓ شَطْبَةٌ, which is applied to a mare: (Ham
p. 298:) or this epithet, شَطْبَةٌ, applied to a mare,
means lank (سَبِطَةٌ) in flesh; (K, TA;) or tall;
(TA;) as also ↓ شِطْبَةٌ in the former sense, (K,
TA,) or in the latter; and the masc. is not thus
used, applied to a horse: (TA:) and ↓ شَطْبَةٌ, (S,)
or ↓ شِطْبَةٌ, (K,) or both, but the former is the
more approved, (TA,) beautiful; plump; or fat,
soft, thin-skinned, and plump; (K, TA;) and
tall: (K:) or simply tall; (S, TA;) as also
↓ مَشْطُوبٌ and ↓ مُشَطَّبٌ applied to a man. (TA.)
شَطْبَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in
seven places: ―
-b2-  and see what next follows.
شُطْبَةٌ (S, K) and ↓ شِطْبَةٌ (K) and ↓ شَطْبَةٌ (TA)
and ↓ شُطَبَةٌ, (K,) which last is said by some to be
a n. un. of شُطَبٌ [mentioned in what follows as a
pl.], (MF,) A [raised] line (طَرِيقَة, S, O, or
طَرِيق, K, [meaning a ridge, and sometimes also
a depressed line, as shown voce مُشَطَّبٌ, i. e. a
channel,]) in the مَتْن [i. e. broad side, or middle
of the broad side, of the blade] (S, O) of a sword:
(S, O, K:) pl. شُطَبٌ and شُطُبٌ, (S, O,) or شُطُوبٌ
and شُطَبٌ and شُطُبٌ: (K: [in which it is said
that the pl. is شُطُوبٌ and شُطَبٌ like غُرَفٌ and
كُتُبٌ: but I think that شُطُوبٌ is a mistranscription, and that the right reading is شُطَبٌ and
شُطُبٌ like غُرَفٌ and كُتُبٌ:]) hence it would seem
that شُطَبٌ and شُطُبٌ are pls. of one sing.; but
Ibn-Hishám El-Lakhmee expressly states that the
former is pl. of شُطْبَةٌ; and the latter, of ↓ شَطِيبَةٌ;
(MF;) of which شَطَائِبُ also is a pl.; (L in art.
عمد;) and which signifies [the same as شُطْبَةٌ,
i. e.] the rising عَمُود [i. e. the ridge] in the مَتْن
of a sword. (ISh, TA.) [See also مُشَطَّبٌ: and
see عَمُودٌ and مَيْنٌ.]

O, K, TA;) as also ↓ شِطْبَةٌ: (O, K:) or a piece
cut in the form of a strip, but not separated, of a
camel's hump; and so ↓ the latter word: pl. of the
former شَطَائِبُ. (AZ, TA.) ―

lengthwise of a hide or of leather; (S, O;) as also
