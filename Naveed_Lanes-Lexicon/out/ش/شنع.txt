شنع1
شَنُعَ, aor.
شَنُعَ, inf. n. شَنَاعَةٌ (S, O, Msb, K)
and شَنَعٌ and شَنَاعٌ, but this last, occurring in a
verse, may be used by poetic license for شَنَاعَةٌ,
(TA,) It (a thing, S) was, or became, bad, evil,
abominable, foul, or unseemly; (S, * O, * Msb, K;)
syn. قَبُحَ. (Msb. [In the S and O and K, it is
said that شَنَاعَةٌ signifies the same as فَظَاعَةٌ; but
the latter seems to import more than the former.])
-A2-  شَنَعَ فُلَانًا He regarded such a one as bad, evil,
abominable, foul, or unseemly, (اِسْتَقْبَحَهُ, S, O, K,
TA, in the CK اسْتَخَفَّهُ,) and reviled, or vilified,
him, (شَتَمَهُ, O, K, TA, and so accord. to one of
my copies of the S,) or loathed him, (سَئِمَهُ,) thus
in some of the lexicons, [and accord. to one of my
copies of the S,] but [SM says that] شَتَمَهُ is shown
to be the right reading by the saying of IAar that
شَنَعَهُ, inf. n. شَنْعٌ, means سَبَّهُ. (TA.) [See also
10.] ―
-b2-  Also, (O, K,) inf. n. شَنْعٌ, (TA,) He
disgraced such a one; put him to shame; or
exposed his vices, faults, or evil qualities or actions. (O, K, TA.) ―
-b3-  And شَنَعَ الخِرْقَةَ He
frayed the torn-off piece of cloth so that it became shaggy (شَعَّثَهَا حَتَّى تَنَفَّشَ): (O, K: [in the
CK, in the place of the last word of the explanation, which is for تَتَنَفَّشَ, is put تَنْفَشَّ:]) and in
like manner one says of a thing similar to a
خِرْقَة. (O.)
-A3-  شَنِعَ بِهِ: see 10.

التَّشْنِيعُ signifies تَكْثِيرُ الشَّنَاعَةِ [app. meaning
The uttering, or saying, much, or often, what is
bad, evil, abominable, foul, or unseemly: and the
doing what is bad &c. much or often]: (K:) or
the uttering, or saying, what is bad, evil, abominable, foul, or unseemly, (KL, PS,) against any
one: (PS:) and the representing, or regarding, as
bad, &c.: (KL, PS: *) and the committing [an
action that is bad, &c., or] a fault, or vitious
action. (KL.) You say, شَنَّعْتُ عَلَيْهِ, inf. n.
تَشْنِيعٌ, (S, O,) I uttered, or said, what was bad,
evil, abominable, foul, or unseemly, against him:
(PS:) from الشَّنَاعَةُ. (O.) And شنّع عَلَيْهِ الأَمْرَ,
inf. n. as above, He showed, or declared, to him
that the affair was bad, evil, &c.: (TA: [see also
5:]) or characterized the affair to him as bad,
evil, &c. (Msb.)
-A2-  And The striving, labouring,
or exerting oneself, and being quick, and vigorous,
or energetic, syn. التَّشْمِيرُ, (S, O, K, TA, [in the
CK, erroneously, التَّشْهِيرُ,]) and الاِنْكِمَاشُ, and
الجِدُّ, (O, K,) in pace, or going; (O, * K;) as also
↓ التَّشَنُّعُ (K) [and ↓ الإِشْنَاعُ]: thus شنّع is said of
a man, meaning He strove, laboured, or exerted
himself, and was quick: (TA:) and in like manner شَنَّعَتْ is said of a she-camel, (As, A'Obeyd,
S, O,) and of camels, (O,) as also ↓ تشنّعت, (S, *
O, expl. in the former by جَدَّتْ only,) and
↓ اشنعت; (O;) in pace, or going: (S, O:) or
↓ اشنعت said of a she-camel means she was quick,
or swift. (K.)

meaning استشنعهُ, (O, K, TA,) i. e. [He saw a
thing] which he regarded as bad, evil, &c. (TA.)
―
-b2-  And accord. to him, one says also, قَدِ اسْتَشْنَعَ

↓ شُنُوعٌ: (O, K:) thus in the saying, فِى فُلَانٍ
↓ شُنُوعٌ [In such a one is unseemliness, or ugliness]; as also نَظْرَةٌ and رَدٌّ [or rather رَدَّةٌ]: (TA:)
and one says also, فِى وَجْهِهِ شُنْعَةٌ and رَدَّةٌ and نَظْرَةٌ

شَنِيعٌ Bad, evil, abominable, foul, or unseemly;

(S, O, K,) the last like أَكْبَرُ in the phrase اَللّٰهُ
أَكْبَرُ, meaning كَبِيرٌ, accord. to one of the two
interpretations of this phrase: (O, TA:) pl. of the
first شُنُعٌ. (Msb, TA. *) It is applied to a day, in
this sense: or as meaning disliked, or hated:
(TA:) and so is ↓ أَشْنَعُ, (S, O, K, TA,) in the
former sense, (TA,) or in the latter. (O, K, TA.)

story]. (TA.) And ↓ غَيْرَةٌ شَنْعَآءُ Abominable,
excessive jealousy: (O, K, TA:) in [some of] the

[and therefore unseemly,] in make; (IDrd, O, K,
TA;) as also الخَلْقِ ↓ أَشْنَعُ; applied to a man:
the former is from الشُّنُوعُ: and some say that it
signifies tall. (TA.)
