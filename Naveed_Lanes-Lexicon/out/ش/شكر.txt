شكر1
شَكَرَ لَهُ, and شَكَرَهُ, (S, Mgh, K,) but the
former is the more chaste, (S,) and the latter is
for شَكَرَ نِعْمَتَهُ, (A,) aor.
شَكُرَ, (TA,) inf. n. شُكْرٌ and
شُكْرَانٌ (S, A, * Msb, K) and شُكُورٌ, (S, K) which
last, in the Kur lxxvi. 9, may be either an inf. n.
or pl. of شُكْرٌ [used as a simple subst.], (S,) He
thanked him; or praised, eulogized, or commended,
him, for a benefit or benefits: (S:) he was grateful, or thankful, to him; or he acknowledged his
beneficence, and spoke of it largely: (S, *  K: [but
in the S, the verb in the former sense has شُكْرٌ
only for its inf. n., and it is implied that in the
latter sense it has for its inf. n. only شُكْرَانٌ, as
will be seen below:]) and شَكَرَ لِلّٰهِ, and شَكَرَ اللّٰهَ,
(Lh, Msb, K,) which latter is less common than
the former, and even disallowed by As in prose,
though allowed by him in verse, (Msb,) and
شَكَرَ بِاللّٰهِ and شَكَرَ نِعْمَةَ اللّٰهِ, and شَكَرَ بِنِعْمَةِ اللّٰهِ,
(Lh, K,) and شَكَرَ لِلّٰهِ نِعْمَتَهُ, (A,) inf. n. شُكْرٌ and
شُكْرَانٌ (Msb) [and شُكُورٌ], He thanked, or praised,
God for his beneficence: (A:) he was grateful, or
thankful, to God; or acknowledged his beneficence,
and spoke of it largely: (K:) he acknowledge
the beneficence of God, and acted in the manner
incumbent on him in rendering Him obedience
and abstaining from disobedience; so that شُكْر is
in word and in deed: (Msb:) and لَهُ ↓ تَشَكَّرَ
signifies the same as شَكَرَ لَهُ: (S, A, Msb, K:) you
say, لَهُ مَا صَنَعَ ↓ تَشَكَّرْتُ [I thanked him, &c., for
what he did]: (A:) and لَهُ بَلَآءَهُ ↓ تشكّر [He was
grateful to Him, &c., i. e. to God, for his probation]: (K:) and أَشْكُرُ إِلَيْكَ نِعَمَ اللّٰهِ [I praise to
thee, or mention to thee with thanks, the favours
of God]: (L in art. حمد:) [but there are many
explanations of شَكَرَ beside those given above: its
meanings will be more fully shown by what here
follows:] شُكْرٌ is the thanking a benefactor; or
praising, eulogizing, or commending, him, (S, A,)
for a benefits: (S:) or the being grateful, or thankful; or acknowledging beneficence;
and speaking of it largely; and [in the copies of
the K, “or,” but this is evidently a mistake,] it is
only on account of favour received; (K;) and
شُكْرَانٌ is [the same, being] contr. of كُفْرَانٌ: (S:)
شُكْرٌ [sometimes] differs from حَمْدٌ; (Msb in art.
حمد;) for شكر is only on account of favour received; whereas حمد is sometimes because of
favour received, (Th, Az, TA in art. حمد, and
Msb ubi suprà,) and sometimes form other causes;
(Th ubi suprà;) [and thus] the latter is of more
common application than the former; (S in art.
حمد;) therefore you do not say شَكَرْتُهُ عَلَى
شَجَاعَتِهِ, but you say حَمِدْتُهُ على شجاعته: (Msb
ubi suprà:) or شُكْرٌ is more common than حَمْدٌ
with respect to its kinds and means, and more
particular with respect to the objects to which it
relates; and the latter is more common with
respect to the objects to which it relates, and
more particular with respect to the means; for the
former is, with the heart, the being humble, or
lowly, and submissive; and with the tongue, the
act of praising, eulogizing, or commending; and
acknowledging beneficence; and with the members,
the act of obeying, and submitting one's self; and
the object to which it relates is the benefactor,
exclusively of his essential qualities; therefore
one does not say شَكَرْنَا اللّٰهَ عَلَى حَيَاتِهِ [we thanked
God for his existence, or praised Him, &c.]; but
He is مَحْمُود on that account, like as He is for his
beneficence; and شُكْرٌ is also for beneficence: thus
حَمْدٌ relates to every object to which, as an object,
شُكْرٌ relates; but the reverse is not the case: and
everything whereby is حمد, thereby is شكر; but
the reverse is not the case; for the latter is by
means of the members, or limbs, and the former
is by means of the tongue: شُكْرٌ is of three kinds;
with the heart, or mind, which is the forming an
[adequate] idea of the benefit; and with the
tongue, which is the praising, eulogizing, or
commending, the benefactor; and with the members, or limbs, which is the requiting the benefit
according to its desert: it rests upon five foundations; humility of him who renders it towards
him to whom it is rendered; his love of him; his
acknowledgment of his benefit; the eulogizing
him for it; and his not making use of the benefit
in a manner which he [who has conferred it] dislikes: it is also explained as devotion of the heart
to love of the benefactor, and of the members to
obey him, and the employment of the tongue in
mentioning him and eulogizing him: [and there
are several other explanations of it which it is
unnecessary to add:] some say that it is formed
by transposition from كَشْرٌ, the “ act of uncovering, or exposing to view: ” others, that it is from
عَيْنٌ شَكْرَى “ a full fountain, or eye; ” accord. to
which etymology it would signify the being full
of the praise of the benefactor. (B, TA.) ―

↓ اشتكر are all verbs from شكِيرٌ. (K.) [It is said
in the K that these verbs are from شكير in all of

preceding verb: and hence they seem to have
the significations here following: ―

their branches:: ―
-b5-  and, said of trees in general
شَجَرَ, (assumed tropical:)  They put forth branches: ―
