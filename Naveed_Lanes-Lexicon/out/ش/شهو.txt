شهو1
شَهِيَهُ and
شَهَاهُ: see 8.
-A2-  شَهَا, aor.
شَهُوَ; and
شَهِىَ, aor.
شَهَوَ; inf. n. شَهْوَةٌ; It [food &c.] was good,
sweet, pleasant, or the like. (MA. [But this, the
only meaning there assigned to these two verbs, I
do not find elsewhere.])
2
شَهَّيْتُهُ [I made him, or caused him, to desire,
to long, or to desire eagerly]. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  [And
شهّى It excited desire, longing, eager desire, or
appetence. For ex., in art. سمق in the K, يُشَهِّى
is said of the سُمَّاق, or berry of the sumach,
meaning It excites appetence.] ―
-b3-  And شهّى الشَّىْءَ
He, or it, caused the thing to be desired, longed
for, or desired eagerly: made it to be good,
sweet, pleasant, or the like. (MA.) One says,
هٰذَا شَىْءٌ يُشَهِّى الطَّعَامَ i. e. [This is a thing that
causes the food to be desired, &c.; that makes it
sweet, &c.; or] that incites to desire, or eager
desire, of the food. (S, TA.) ―
-b4-  [And accord. to
an explanation of the inf. n., تَشْهِيَةٌ, in the KL,
شهّاهُ seems to signify also He said to him, I will
give to thee what thou desirest, longest for, or
eagerly desirest; agreeably with a rendering of
the verb alone, as on the authority of that work,
by Golius.]
3
شاهاهُ, (K, TA,) inf. n. مُشَاهَاةٌ, (TA,) He
was, or became, like him; he resembled him.
(K, TA.)
-A2-  Also He jested, or joked, with him:
(IAar, TA:) [and] so هَاشَاهُ. (K in art. هشو.)
―
-b2-  And accord. to IAar, it is also used in relation
to the smiting action of the [evil] eye [perhaps
meaning He vied with him in smiting with the
evil eye: see also 4]. (TA.)
4
اشهاهُ He gave him what he desired or
eagerly desired. (K.) ―
-b2-  And He smote him
with an [evil] eye: (K:) in this sense [said to be]
formed by transposition from أَشَاهَهُ. (TA.)
-A2-
مَا أَشْهَاهَا إِلَىَّ means that she is desired, or eagerly
desired, [i. e. How great an object of desire is
she to me!] as though it were from شُهِىَ, though
this was not said: and مَا أَشْهَانِى لَهَا means that
thou art desiring, or eagerly desiring, [i. e. How
desirous, or eagerly desirous, am I of her!] so
says Sb. (TA.)
5
تشهّى He demanded with repeated desire.
(K, TA.) So in the saying, (TA,) تشهّى عَلَى
فُلَانٍ كَذَا (S, TA) [He demanded with repeated
desire, of such a one, such a thing]. ―
-b2-  See also
what next follows.
8
اشتهاهُ (S, &c.) He desired it, or longed for
it: (Msb:) he loved it; and desired it, or wished
for it: (K:) or he desired it eagerly, or intensely: (M in art. فرس: [see an ex. in a poetical
citation voce فَرَّسَ:]) and ↓ شَهِيَهُ, (S, Msb, K,)
aor.
شَهَوَ; (Msb, K;) as also ↓ شَهَاهُ, aor.
شَهُوَ; (AZ,
Msb, K;) inf. n. شَهْوَةٌ (S, TA) and شَاهِيَةٌ, which
last is an inf. n. [of a rare class] like عَاقِبَةٌ; (TA;)
signifies the same: (S, Msb, K:) and so does
↓ تشهّاهُ. (K.) [See what next follows.]
شَهْوَةٌ [mentioned above as an inf. n.] is a word
of well-known meaning; (S;) Desire, or longing,
or yearning, of the soul for a thing; (Er-Rághib,
Msb, TA;) [meaning for a thing gratifying
to sense: or eager, or intense, desire; particularly
for such a thing; for] it has a more intensive signification than إِرَادَةٌ; and the intelligent agree in
opinion that it is not commendable: (M in art.
فرس:) [being either lawful or unlawful, it may
be rendered as above: or appetite: or appetence:
or lust: or carnal lust:] in the present state of
existence, it is of two sorts, صَادِقَةٌ [i. e. true], and
كَاذِبَةٌ [i. e. false]; the former being that without
which the body becomes in an unsound state, as
the شَهْوَة [or desire &c.] for food on the occasion
of hunger; and the latter being that without
which the body does not become in an unsound
state: and sometimes it is applied to the object of
desire &c., or thing desired &c.: (Er-Rághib,
TA:) and agreeably with this last explanation the
first of the following pls. is used in the Kur iii.
12: (Ksh, Bd, Jel:) sometimes also it is applied
to the faculty to which a thing is made an object
of desire &c.: (Er-Rághib, TA:) [also, to the
gratification of venereal lust; thus in the K in
art. شفر; see شَفِرَتْ and شَفِرَةٌ:] the pl. is شَهَوَاتٌ
(Msb, TA) and أَشْهِيَةٌ and شُهًى; the last mentioned by AHei, and a rare instance of a pl. of the
measure فُعَلٌ from a sing. of the measure فَعْلَةٌ
having an infirm letter for its last radical, like
جُهًى pl. of جَهْوَةٌ [and like قُرًى pl. of قَرْيَةٌ].
(TA.) [الشَّهْوَتَانِ means The two appetites, that
of the stomach and that of the generative organ.]
الشَّهْوَةُ الخَفِيَّةُ [The latent desire &c.] mentioned
in a trad. is said to be any act of disobedience
which one conceives in his mind, and upon which
he resolves: or one's seeing a beautiful young
woman, and lowering his eyes, then looking with
his heart, and imaging her to his mind, and so
tempting himself. (JM.) [شَهْوَةُ الطِّينِ, lit. The
longing for clay, is app. used as a general term
for malacia: see حُمَّاضٌ.]
شَهْوَانُ (S, Msb, K, TA) and ↓ شَهْوَانِىٌّ and
↓ شَهِىٌّ, (K, TA,) applied to a man, Desirous, or
longing; (S, * Msb, * K, * TA;) or very desirous
or longing; greedy; or voracious: (TA:) fem.
(of the first, Msb) شَهْوَى: (Msb, K, TA:) pl. [of
the first] شَهَاوَى, (K, TA,) like سَكَارَى [pl. of
سَكْرَانُ]. (TA.) [See an ex. of the pl. in a verse
cited voce جَرْدَبَانٌ.] One says, رَجُلٌ شَهْوَانُ لِلشَّىْءِ
[A man desirous &c. of the thing]. (S.)
شَهْوَانِىٌّ: see the next preceding paragraph.
شَهِىٌّ i. q. ↓ مُشْتَهًى (S, Msb) [i. e. Desired,
longed for, or eagerly desired:] or pleasant,
delicious, or sweet: (Msb, TA:) applied to food,
(S,) and to water. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] أَبُو الشَّهِىِّ
(assumed tropical:)  The بَرْبَط [or Persian lute]. (KL.) ―
-b3-  [And
Golius adds, as on the authority of a gloss in a
copy of the KL, (assumed tropical:)  The water-melon (anguria).]
-A2-  See also شَهْوَانُ.
شَهَّآءٌ A man having much, or frequent, desire or
longing or eager desire. (TA.) [See also شَهْوَانُ.]
شَاهٍ [act. part. n. of 1; Desiring, or longing;
&c.]. (Sb, TA.)
-A2-  شَاهِى البَصَرِ A man sharp of
sight: (S, K:) formed by transposition from
شَائِهُ البَصَرِ. (S.)
أَشْهَى [More, and most, desirable, or pleasant
or delicious or sweet]. One says, هُوَ أَشْهَى إِلَىَّ
مِنْ كَذَا [It is more desirable, or pleasant &c.,
to me, or in my estimation, than such a thing].
(Msb voce إِلَى.) See also another ex. in a verse
cited voce إِلَى, in art. الو.
مُشْتَهًى: see شَهِىٌّ. ―
-b2-  [Used as a subst., its pl.
is مُشْتَهَيَاتٌ.]
