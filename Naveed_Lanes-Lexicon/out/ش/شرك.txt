شَرِكَهُ فِيهِ, aor.
شَرَكَ, inf. n. شِرْكَةٌ (S, Mgh, *

the latter, but the more usual, (Msb,) and شِرْكٌ
(Mgh, Msb) and شَرِكٌ, the former of these two a
contraction of the latter, but the more usual,
(Msb,) or شِرْكٌ [q. v. infrà] is a simple subst.,
(S, K,) [He shared, participated, or partook,
with him in it;] he was, or became, a شَرِيك [or
copartner &c.] to him in it; (Msb;) namely, a
sale or purchase, and an inheritance, (S, K,) or
an affair; (Msb;) and فيه ↓ شاركهُ [signifies the
same]. (Mgh, Msb, * K. * [It is said in the TA,
after the mention of شَرِكَهُ with its inf. n. شِرْكَةٌ,
that it is more chaste than ↓ اشركهُ; by which it
is implied that this latter is sometimes used as
syn. with the former; for which I do not find any
express authority.] And He entered with him
into it; [or engaged with him in it;] namely, an
affair. (TA.)
-A2-  شَرِكَتِ النَّعْلُ, aor.
شَرَكَ, The sandal

شَارَكْتُ فُلَانًا, (S, TA,) inf. n. مُشَارَكَةٌ, (TK,)
[I shared, participated, or partook, with such a
one;] I was, or became, the شَرِيك [or copartner
&c.] of such a one. (S, TA.) El-Jaadee says,
وَشَارَكْنَا قُرَيْشًا فِى تُقَاهَا
العِنَانِ ↓ وَفِى أَحْسَابِهَا شِرْكَ
[And we shared with Kureysh in their piety and
in their several grounds of pretension to respect,
with a sharing exclusive of other properties].
(S.) See also 1. [And see 8.]
4
أَشْرَكْتُهُ فِى الأَمْرِ I made him a شَرِيك [or
copartner &c.] to me in the affair: and ↓ شَرَّكْتُ
بَيْنَهُمْ فِى المَالِ [I made them copartners in the
property; and شَرَّكَهُمْ, occurring in this art. in the
TA, on the authority of Esh-Sháfi'ee, means, in
like manner, he made them copartners; and
أَشْرَكَ بَيْنَهُمْ is used in this sense in the present art.
in the K]. (Msb.) وَأَشْرِكْهُ فِى أَمْرِى, in the Kur
[xx. 33], means And make Thou him my شَرِيك
[or copartner, or associate, or colleague,] in my
affair. (S.) And one says also, اشركهُ مَعَهُ فِى
الأَمْرِ He made him to enter [or engage] with him
in the affair: and اشرك فُلَانًا فِى البَيْعِ He made
such a one to enter [or share] with him in the
sale or purchase. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] اشرك بِاللّٰهِ
He attributed to God a شَرِيك [or copartner
&c.] (Mgh, TA) in his dominion: (TA:) [or he
attributed to God شُرَكَآء i. e. copartners &c.,
such as the angels and the devils: (see Kur vi.
100, &c., and any of the expositions thereof:)
i. e. he believed in a duality, or a plurality, of
gods:] and [in a wider sense,] he disbelieved [or
misbelieved] in God: syn. كَفَرَ: (S, * Msb, K, TA:)
used in this latter sense because الكُفْرُ is not free
from some kind of شِرْك. (Kull p. 49.)

and each with the other; or were, or became,
copartners, &c.;] فِى كَذَا [in such a thing]. (S.)
―
-b2-  [Hence,] الاِشْتِرَاكُ in lexicology signifies The
being homonymous; lit. the being shared, or participated, in by several meanings: [used as a
subst., homonymy:] (Mz, 25th نوع; and Intr. to
the TA:) one says of a noun [or word] that is
termed مُشْتَرَكٌ [q. v.], تَشْتَرِكُ فِيهِ مَعَانٍ كَثِيرَةٌ
[Many meanings share, or participate, in it].
(TA.) ―
-b3-  And اشترك الأَمْرُ (assumed tropical:)  The affair, or case,
was, or became, confused, and dubious. (TA.)
شَرْكٌ: see what next follows.
شِرْكٌ is an inf. n. of شَرِكَهُ, as mentioned in the
first sentence of this art.: (Mgh, Msb:) or a
subst. therefrom: (S:) and is syn. with ↓ شِرْكَةٌ,
[signifying A sharing, participating or participation, partaking, or copartnership, and mentioned before as an inf. n.,] (K,) as also are
↓ شَرِكٌ and ↓ شَرِكَةٌ, [likewise mentioned before as
inf. ns.,] and ↓ شَرْكٌ and ↓ شَرْكَةٌ, (MF, TA,) and
so is ↓ شُرْكَةٌ, with damm, (K,) this last said by
MF to be unknown, but it is common in Syria,
almost to the exclusion of the other dial. vars.
mentioned above. (TA.) An ex. of the first
occurs in a trad, of Mo'ádh, أَجَازَ بَيْنَ أَهْلِ اليَمَنِ
الشِّرْكَ, meaning [He allowed, among the people
of El-Yemen,] the sharing, one with another,
(الاِشْتِرَاك,) in land [and app. its produce], by its
owner giving it to another for the half [app. of
its produce], or the third, or the like thereof: and
a similar ex. of the same word occurs in another
trad. (TA.) See also an ex. in a verse cited
above, conj. 3. And one says, رَغِبْنَا فِى شِرْكِكُمْ,
meaning We are desirous of sharing with you in
affinity, or relationship by marriage. (K, * TA.)
―
-b2-  And A share: (Mgh, O, Msb, TA:) as in the
saying, بِيعَ شِرْكٌ مِنْ دَارِهِ [A share of his house
was sold]: (Mgh:) and as in the saying, أَعْتَقَ
شِرْكًا لَهُ فِى عَبْدٍ [He emancipated a share belonging to him in a slave]: (Msb:) pl. أَشْرَاكٌ.
(O, Msb, TA.) [See a verse of Lebeed cited
voce زَعَامَةٌ.] ―
-b3-  It is also a subst. from أَشْرَكَ بِاللّٰهِ;
(Mgh, Msb, K, TA;) thus in the Kur xxxi. 12;
(Mgh, TA;) meaning The attribution of a شَرِيك
[or copartner &c., or of شُرَكَآء i. e. copartners
&c., (see 4,)] to God: (Mgh:) [so that it may be
rendered belief in a plurality of gods:] and [in a
wider sense,] unbelief [or misbelief]; syn. كُفْرٌ.
(S, Msb, K, TA.) And it is also expl. as meaning
Hypocrisy: (Mgh, TA:) so in the saying of the
Prophet, إِنَّ أَخْوَفَ مَا أَخَافُ عَلَى أُمَّتِى الشِّرْكُ
[Verily the most fearful of what I fear for my
people is hypocrisy]: (Mgh:) and so in the trad.,
الشِّرْكُ أَخْفَى فِى أُمَّتِى مِنْ دَبِيبِ النَّمْلِ [Hypocrisy is more latent in my people than the creeping
of ants]. (IAth, TA.) ―
-b4-  See also شَرِيكٌ, in two
places.
شَرَكٌ The حِبَالَة [properly a sing., meaning
snare, but here app. used as a gen. n., meaning
snares, as will be seen from what follows,] of the
صَائِد [i. e. sportsman, or catcher of game, or wild
animals, or birds]; one of which is called
↓ شَرَكَةٌ: (S, O:) the meaning of the شَرَك of the
صَائِد is well known; and the pl. is أَشْرَاكٌ; like
سَبَبٌ and أَسْبَابٌ: or, as some say, شَرَكٌ is the pl.
of ↓ شَرَكَةٌ, [or rather is a coll. gen. n. of which
↓ شَرَكَةٌ is the n. un.,] like قَصَبٌ and قَصَبَةٌ:
(Msb:) [i. e.,] شَرَكٌ signifies the حَبَائِل [or snares,
or by this may perhaps be meant the cords composing a snare, for حَبَائِلُ is an anomalous pl. of
حَبْلٌ,] for catching wild animals or the like; and
what is, or are, set up for [catching] birds:
(K, TA:) one whereof is said to be called ↓ شَرَكَةٌ
[a term used in the K, in art. شبك, as the explanation of شَبَكَةٌ, which means a net]: (TA:) and
the pl. of شَرَكٌ is شُرُكٌ, with two dammehs, which
is extr. [with respect to analogy, like فُلُكٌ pl. of
فَلَكٌ]. (K.) Hence the trad., أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ شَرِّ
الشَّيْطَانِ وَشَرَكِهِ, meaning حَبَائِلِهِ وَمَصَايِدِهِ [i. e.
I seek protection by Thee from the mischief of
the Devil, and his snares]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  شَرَكُ الطَّرِيقِ
means The main and middle parts of the road;
(S, K;) syn. جَوَادُّهُ: or the tracks that are [conspicuous and distinct,] not obscure to one nor
blended together: (K:) pl. [or rather coll. gen. n.]
of ↓ شَرَكَةٌ: (S:) or the أَنْسَاع of the road; (As,
TA;) i. e. the furrows of the road, made by the
beasts with their legs [or feet] in its surface, a
↓ شَرَكَة here and another by the side of it: (TA:)
or أَشْرَاكٌ [is its pl., and] signifies the small tracks
that branch off from the main road and then stop,
or terminate. (Sh, TA.) [See أُسٌّ.]
شَرِكٌ: see شِرْكٌ, first sentence.
شَرْكَةٌ: see شِرْكٌ, first sentence.
شُرْكَةٌ: see شِرْكٌ, first sentence.
شِرْكَةٌ: see شِرْكٌ, first sentence. ―
-b2-  Also A
piece of flesh-meat; of the dial. of El-Yemen;
originally, of a slaughtered camel, in which people
share, one with another. (TA.)
شَرَكَةٌ: see شَرَكٌ, in six places.
شَرِكَةٌ: see شِرْكٌ, first sentence.
شُرَكِىٌّ and شُرَّكِىٌّ A quick, or swift, pace:
(K:) so says ISd. (TA.) And لَطْمٌ شُرَكِىٌّ A
quick and consecutive slapping, (S, O, K,) like
the camel's slapping when a thorn has entered
his foot and he beats the ground with it with a
consecutive beating. (S, * O.) Ows Ibn-Hajar
says,
وَمَا أَنَ إِلَّا مُسْتَعِدٌّ كَمَا تَرَى
أَخُو شُرَكِىِّ الوِرْدِ غَيْرُ مُعَتِّمِ
[And I am none other than one who is ready, as
thou seest; one in the habit of quick and consecutive coming to water; not one who is dilatory]:
i. e., one coming to water time after time, consecutively: he means, I will do to thee what thou
dislikest, not delaying to do that. (S.)
شِرَاكٌ The thong, or strap, of the sandal, (Mgh,
Msb, K, TA,) that is on the face thereof, (TA,)
upon the back [meaning upper side] of the foot,
(Mgh, Msb,) [extending from the thong, or strap,
that passes between two of the toes, towards the
ankle, and having two arms (its عَضُدَانِ), which
are attached to the أُذُنَانِ (q. v.), or pass through
these and unite behind the foot: see also خِزَامَةٌ,
and فَرَصَهُ, whence it appears to mean also each
arm, and the two arms, of the شِرَاك properly so
called: and see سَيْرٌ, where it appears to be used
as meaning a thong or strap, absolutely:] the
شِرَاك of the sandal is well known: (O:) pl. شُرُكٌ,
(O, K, TA,) and accord. to the K أَشْرُكٌ also, but
this is a mistake. (TA.) To this is likened, in a
trad., the shadow at the base of a wall, on the
eastern side thereof, when very small [or narrow],
showing that the sun has begun to decline from
the meridian. (Mgh, Msb,) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] (assumed tropical:)  A
streak of herbage: (S, O, K:) pl. شُرُكٌ, (S, O,
TA,) expl. by AHn as meaning herbage in
streaks; not continuous. (TA.) One says, الكَلَأُ
فِى بَنِى فُلَانٍ شُرُكٌ (assumed tropical:)  The herbage among the sons
of such a one is composed of streaks. (Aboo-Nasr, S, O.) ―
-b3-  [In the K voce بَنَقَ it is used as
meaning (assumed tropical:)  A row of shoots, or offsets, cut from
palm-trees and planted, such as are termed, when
planted, مُبَنَّقٌ and مُنَبَّقٌ.] ―
-b4-  [Hence,] one says,
مَضَوْا عَلَى شِرَاكٍ وَاحِدٍ (tropical:)  [They went away in one
uniform line or manner]. (TA.) And اِجْعَلِ
الأَمْرَ شِرَاكًا وَاحِدًا (assumed tropical:)  Make thou the affair, or
case, [uniform, or] one uniform thing. (Fr, TA
in art. بأج.)
شَرِيكٌ act. part. n. of شَرِكَةٌ; (Mgh;) i. q.
↓ مُشَارِكٌ [A sharer, participator, partaker, or
partner, with another; a copartner, an associate,
or a colleague, of another]; (K;) and ↓ شِرْكٌ
signifies the same: (Az, K, TA:) a sharer in
what is not divided: (K and TK in art. خلط:)
or a sharer in the rights of a thing that is
sold: (Mgh in that art.:) pl. شُرَكَآءُ and أَشْرَاكٌ,
(S, O, Msb, K, TA,) like شُرَفَآءُ and أَشْرَافٌ pls. of
شَرِيفٌ; (S, O, TA;) or the latter is pl. of ↓ شِرْكٌ:
(Az, TA:) a woman is termed شَرِيكَةٌ; (S, O, K;)
which is applied to a man's جَارَة [i. e. wife, or
object of love]; (TA;) and the pl. of this is شَرَائِكُ.
(S, O, K.) Az mentions his having heard one of
the Arabs say, فُلَانٌ شَرِيكُ فُلَانٍ meaning Such a
one is married to the daughter, or to the sister, of
such a one; what people call the خَتَن [of such a
one]. (TA.)
مُشْرِكٌ and ↓ مُشْرِكِىٌّ, (S, O, K,) like as one
says دَوٌّ and دَوِّىٌّ, and قَعْسَرٌ and قَعْسَرِىٌّ, (S, O,)
One who attributes to God a شَرِيك [or copartner
&c., or شُرَكَآء i. e. copartners &c. (see 4)]: (O:)
[i. e. a believer in a duality, or a plurality, of
gods:] and [in a wider sense,] a disbeliever [or
misbeliever] in God. (S, O, K.) Abu-l-'Abbás
explains [the pl.] مُشْرِكُونَ in the Kur xvi. 102
as meaning Those who are مشركون by their
obeying the Devil; by their worshipping God
and worshipping with Him the Devil. (TA.) ―
-b2-
[In one place, in the CK, the former word is
erroneously put for مُشْتَرَكٌ, q. v., last sentence.]
مُشْرِكِىٌّ: see the next preceding paragraph.
الفَرِيضَةُ المُشَرَّكَةُ, (O, K, TA,) or المَسْأَلَةُ
المَشَرَّكَةُ, (Msb,) for المُشَرَّكُ فِيهَا, (Msb, TA,) is
That [assigned portion of inheritance, or the
question relating thereto (المَسْأَلَةُ المُشَرَّكَةُ being
for مَسْأَلَةُ الفَرِيضَةِ المُشَرَّكَةِ),] in which the brothers
by the mother's side [only] and those by [both]
the father's and the mother's sides are made to
share together; (O, Msb, * K, TA;) also called
↓ المُشَرِّكَةُ [that makes to share], tropically;
(Msb;) and called also ↓ المُشْتَرَكَةُ [for المُشْتَرَكُ
فِيهَا i. e. that is shared in]: (Lth, K, TA:) this is
the case of a husband and a mother and brothers
by the mother's side and brothers by the father's
and mother's sides: (O, K, TA:) for the wife is
half; and for the mother, a sixth; and for the
brothers by the mother's side, a third, and the
brothers by the father's and mother's sides share
with them: (O, TA:) 'Omar decided in a case of
this kind by assigning the third to two brothers
by the mother's side, and not assigning anything
to the brothers by the father's and mother's sides;
whereupon they said, يَا أَمِيرَ المُؤْمِنِينَ هَبْ أَنَّ
أَبَانَا كَانَ حِمَارًا فَأَشْرِكْنَا بِقَرَابَةِ أُمَّنَا [O Prince of
the Believers, suppose that our father was an ass,
and make us to share by reason of the relationship of our mother]: so he made them to share
together (فَأَشْرَكَ بَيْنَهُمْ [thus in the O and K, but
correctly فَشَرَّكَ بينهم, or, as afterwards in the TA,
فَشَرَّكَهُمْ]): (O, K, TA:) therefore it (i. e. the
فَرِيضَة, TA) was called مُشَرَّكَة [and مُشَرِّكَة] and
مُشْتَرَكَة, [in the CK, erroneously, مُشْرَكَة,] and
also حِمَارِيَّة: (K, TA:) and it is also called حَجَرِيَّة,
because it is related that they said, هَبْ أَنَّ أَبَانَا
كَانَ حَجَرًا مُلْقًى فِى اليَمِّ [suppose that our
father was a stone thrown into the sea]; and
[therefore] some called it يَمِّيَّة: and it was called
also عُمَرِيَّة. (TA. [More is there added, explaining different decisions of this case.])
المُشَرِّكَةُ: see the next preceding paragraph.
مُشَارِكٌ: see شَرِيكٌ. ―
-b2-  رِيحٌ مُشَارِكٌ means A
wind to which the نَكْبَآء [q. v.] is nearer than the
two winds between which this blows. (K.)
مُشْتَرَكٌ, applied to a road (طَرِيق, Mgh, Msb,
TA), is for مُشْتَرَكٌ فِيهِ, (Msb,) meaning [Shared
in: or] in which the people are equal [sharers].
(TA.) ―
-b2-  Hence, الأَجِيرُ المُشْتَرَكُ [in my copy of
the Mgh, erroneously, المُشْتَرِكُ,] The hired man
[that is shared in; i. e.,] whose work no one has
for himself exclusively of others, but who works
for every one who repairs to him for work, like
the tailor in the sitting-places of the markets;
(Msb;) or who works for whom he pleases: as to
أَجِيرُ المُشْتَرَكِ, it is not right, unless the word thus
governed in the gen. case be expl. as an inf. n.
(Mgh.) ―
-b3-  See also الفَرِيضَةُ المُشَرَّكَةُ, above. ―
-b4-
اِسْمٌ مُشْتَرَكٌ [in like manner for مُشْتَرَكٌ فِيهِ A
noun shared in by several meanings; i. e. a homonym;] a noun shared in by many meanings, such
as عَيْنٌ and the like: (Mz, 25th نوع; and TA
in the present art. and in the Intr.:) or مُشْتَرَكٌ
signifies a word having two, or more, meanings;
and is applied to a noun, and to the pret. of a verb
as denoting predication and prayer, and to the
aor. as denoting the present and the future, and
to a particle: (Mz ubi suprà:) [مُشْتَرَكٌ used as
a subst., meaning a homonym, has for its pl.
مُشْتَرَكَاتٌ.] ―
-b5-  [الحِسُّ المُشْتَرَكُ, for المُشْتَرَكُ فِيهِ,
signifies, in the conventional language of the
philosophers, The faculty of fancy; so called
because “ participated in ” by the five senses:
but it is vulgarly used as meaning common sense.]
―
-b6-  مُشْتَرَكٌ applied to a man, [for مُشْتَرَكٌ فِيهِ,]
means (assumed tropical:)  Talking to himself, like him who is affected with anxiety; (As, S, K, TA; [in the CK,
erroneously, مُشْرِكٌ;]) his judgment being shared
in; not one. (TA.)
