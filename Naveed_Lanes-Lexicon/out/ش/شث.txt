شثشَثٌّ A species of tree, (As, IDrd, ISd, Msb,)
of those that grow upon the mountains, (As,) or
a certain plant, (S, K,) of sweet odour, (S, Msb,
K,) but bitter to the taste, (S, Msb,) with which
one tans, (S, K,) growing in the mountains of
El-Ghowr (ADk, Msb) and Tihámeh and Nejd;
(ADk;) a kind of tree like the dwarf-apple-tree,
(AHn, Mgh,) in size, (AHn,) the leaves of which
are like those of the خِلَاف [q. v.], (AHn, Mgh,)
and are used for tanning therewith, (Mgh,) without thorns, and having a small rose-coloured
[fruit of the kind called] بَرَمَة, in which are three
or four black grains, resembling the شِينِيز [q. v.],
which, when scattered, are eaten by the pigeons:
n. un. with ة. (AHn:) the word occurs in a
trad. as the name of a tan: Az says that it is a
mistake for شَبّ, though he knew not whether the
شَثّ were used for tanning, or not: (TA:) [Mtr,
however, says that] شِبّ is a mistake in this case,
for it is a species of زَاج, and is a dye, not a tan:
(Mgh:) accord. to some, (TA,) the شَثّ is the
wild nut (جَوْزُ البَرِّ). (K [in which this last is
mentioned as a distinct signification] and TA.)
[See also شَبٌّ.]
