شalphabetical letter
ش
The thirteenth letter of the alphabet: called
شِينٌ. It is one of the letters termed مَهْمُوسَة [or
non-vocal, i. e. pronounced with the breath only,
without the voice]; and of the letters termed
شَجْرِيَّة, (TA,) from الشَّجْرُ, which means “ the
place of the opening of the mouth. ” (TA on the
letter ج. See also شِيْنٌ in art. شين.) It is sometimes substituted for the affixed pronoun of the
second pers. fem., كِ; as in رَأَيْتُشِ for رَأَيْتُكِ, and
as in the following verse,
فَعَيْنَاشِ عَيْنَاهَا وَجِيدُشِ جِيدُهَا
وَلٰكِنَّ السَّاقِ مِنْشِ رَقِيقُ
[And thy two eyes are her two eyes, and thy neck
is her neck; but the bone of thy shank is slender];
i. e. عَيْنَاكَ and جِيْدُكِ and مِنْكِ: this substitution
for the affixed pronoun of the second pers. fem.
is of dial. of Benoo-'Amr and Temeem; and
is not restricted to cases of pausation, as is shown
by the verse above cited, though some assert it to
be so: it is also substituted for the ك of دِيك,
when with kesr, so that they said دِيشٍ: also for
جٍ, as in مُدَمَّشٌ[or مُدْمَشٌ], for مُدَمَّجٌ [or
مُدْمَجٌ]: and for س, as in جَعْشُوشٌ, for جَعْسُوسٌ.
(MF. [See also De Sacy's Chrest, Arabe, sec.
ed., iii. 530-31.])
-A2-  [As a numeral, it denotes
Three hundred.]
