شرى1
شَرَاهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K, &c.,) aor.
شَرِىَ, (S, Msb,
K,) inf. n. شِرًى (S, Mgh, Msb, TA) and شِرَآءٌ,
(S, * Mgh, Msb, * TA,) the former inf. n. the more
in repute, (Msb, TA,) and this is of the dial. of
Nejd, the latter being of the dial. of El-Hijáz, or
the latter may be said to be with medd for the
purpose of assimilating it to a preceding word,
accord. to El-Munádee, or it may be regarded as
an inf. n. of شَارَاهُ, (TA,) i. q. بَاعَهُ [in the sense
in which this is generally used, i. e. He sold it];
(S, Mgh, K;) he gave it for a price: (Msb:) and
i. q. ↓ اِشْتَرَاهُ [in the sense in which this is generally
used, i. e. he bought it]; (S, Mgh;) i. e. شَرَاهُ signifies also he took it, or acquired it, for a price:
(Msb:) or this and ↓ اشتراه both signify بَاعَهُ [as
meaning he sold it]; (T, * K, TA;) but the former
is more used than the latter in this sense: (T,
TA:) and both signify also [he bought it; i. e.]
he possessed it by sale; (K;) which is the more
usual meaning of the latter: (T, TA:) thus the
former has two contr. meanings, (S, Msb, K,)
and the latter also: (K:) for the two persons
selling and buying sell and buy the price and the
thing upon which the price is put; so that each of
the things given in exchange is sold in one point
of view and bought in another. (Msb, TA.) It
is said in the Kur [ii. 203], وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَنْ يَشْرِى
نَفْسَهُ ابْتِغَآءَ مَرْضَاةِ اللّٰهِ i. e. [And of men is he]
who sells [himself in the endeavour to obtain the
approval of God]. (S, * TA.) And in the same,
[xii. 20], وَشَرَوْهُ بِثَمَنٍ بَخْسٍ i. e. And they sold
him [for a deficient, or an insufficient, price].
(S, TA.) And in the same [ii. 15], أُولَائِكَ الَّذِينَ
الضَّلَالَةَ بِالْهُدَى ↓ اشْتَرَوُا, originally اشْتَرَيُوا, (S,)
[lit. Those are they who have purchased error
with right direction,] meaning, (tropical:)  who have taken
الضلالة in exchange for الهدى: (Ksh, Bd, Jel:)
or (tropical:)  who have preferred الضلالة to الهدى: (Ksh,
Bd:) [for] of any one who relinquishes a thing
and lays hold upon another thing, one says اشتراه;
(K, TA;) which is thus tropically used [as meaning (tropical:)  he took it in exchange بِغَيْرِهِ by giving up
another thing]; (TA;) and hence this saying in
the Kur-án. (K, TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] شَرَى بِنَفْسِهِ
عَنِ القَوْمِ (tropical:)  He advanced before the people, or
party, (K, TA,) to their enemy, (TA,) and fought
in defence of them: or (tropical:)  he advanced to the
Sultán, and spoke for the people: (K, TA:) [as
though he sold himself for them; the ب in بنفسه
being app. redundant:] or, as in the Tekmileh,
شَرَى بِنَفْسِهِ إِلَى القَوْمِ (tropical:)  he advanced to the people,
or party, and fought them. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And شَرَى
فُلَانًا, (K,) inf. n. شِرًى, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  He mocked at,
scoffed at, laughed at, derided, or ridiculed, such
a one: (K:) [and] so ↓ شَرَّاهُ. (TA voce جَدَّعَهُ
[q. v.: thus there written, perhaps for the purpose
of assimilating it to جَدَّعَهُ].) ―
-b4-  And i. q. أَرْغَمَهُ
(assumed tropical:)  [He angered such a one; or did evil to him,
and angered him]: (Lh, K, TA:) and so أَوْرَمَهُ,
and غَطَاهُ [or perhaps عَظَاهُ, for both are expl.
alike]: all said of God. (Lh, TA.) And فَعَلَ
بِهِ مَا شَرَاهُ (assumed tropical:)  He did to him that which occasioned
evil to him; or that which displeased, grieved, or
vexed, him; syn. سَآءَهُ. (TA.) And لَحَاهُ اللّٰهُ وَشَرَاهُ
(assumed tropical:)  [May God remove him far from good or prosperity, or curse him, and do evil to him, or displease or grieve or vex him]. (TA.)
-A2-  شَرَى اللّٰهُ
فُلَانًا, (K,) inf. n. شِرًى, (TA,) also signifies God
smote him, or may God smite him, with the
eruption termed شَرًى [q. v.]. (K, TA.)
-A3-  And
شَرَاهُ, (K,) aor.
شَرِىَ, inf. n. شِرًى, (TA,) i. q. شَرَّرَهُ,
(K, TA,) i. e. He spread it [to dry]; (TA;) [in
copies of the K, in art. شر, written, in this sense,
↓ شَرَّاهُ;] namely, flesh-meat, and a garment, or
piece of cloth, and [the preparation of curd called]
أَقِط. (K.)
-A4-  شَرِىَ, aor.
شَرَىَ, inf. n. شَرًى, (S, K,)
said of lightning, (S, K, &c.,) It shone, or
gleamed, much: (S:) or it shone, or gleamed,
(K, TA,) and spread in the face of the clouds, or,
as in the T, became dispersed in the face of the
clouds: (TA:) and ↓ اشرى signifies the same;
(K;) or it shone, or gleamed, consecutively: the
latter verb mentioned by Sgh. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And
hence, (S,) said of the nose-rein of a camel, (S,
TA,) It was, or became, in a state of commotion,
(TA,) or, of much commotion. (S, TA.) [See
also 12.]) ―
-b3-  Also, (K,) aor. and inf. n. as above,
(TA,) He (a man) was, or became, angry: (K,
TA:) or he was, or became, flurried by reason of
anger. (S, TA.) ―
-b4-  And, said of evil, or mischief, It spread, بَيْنَهُمْ among them: (K, TA:) or
became great, or formidable; and in like manner
said of an affair, or event. (Nh, TA. [See also
10.]) ―
-b5-  Also, and ↓ استشرى, He (a man, S)
persisted, or persevered, (S, K,) in an affair, (S,)
or in his error, and his corrupt conduct: and the
former, said of a man, is like غَرِىَ in measure
and meaning [i. e. he persisted, or persevered, in
his anger]. (TA.) One says of a horse, شَرِىَ فِى
سَيْرِهِ, (S, K,) inf. n. as above, (TA,) He per-
sisted, or persevered, in his pace, or going; as also
↓ استشرى: (S:) or he exceeded the usual bounds
therein, (K, TA,) and went on without languor:
(TA:) and فِى عَدْوِهِ ↓ استشرى he (i. e. a horse)
persisted, or persevered, in his running: (Mgh:)
and شَرِىَ فِى لِجَامِهِ he (a horse) strained his
bridle. (A, TA.) And شَرِيَتْ عَيْنُهُ بِالدَّمْعِ His
eye persisted, or persevered, in the shedding of
tears, the tears pouring forth consecutively.

K, TA.)
2

شَارَاهُ, inf. n. مُشَارَاةٌ and شِرَآءٌ, i. q. بَايَعَهُ [as
signifying He sold and bought with him: and he
bartered, or exchanged commodities, with him:
that شاراه has both of these meanings (like بايعه)
is shown by the fact that مُشَارَاةٌ is also expl. in
the TA, on the authority of Er-Rághib, as signifying the same as قِبَاضٌ]. (K.) ―
-b2-  Also, (Mgh,)
inf. n. مُشَارَاةٌ, (TA,) He persisted in contention,
litigation, or wrangling: (Mgh:) one says, هُوَ
يُشَارِيهِ (T, M, K) He persists in contention, litigation, or wrangling, with him: (M, TA:) or he
contends in altercation, disputes, or litigates, with
him; or does so vehemently, or obstinately; syn.
يُجَادِلُهُ: (K, TA:) and it is said of the Prophet,
in a trad., كَانَ لَا يُشَارِى وَلَا يُمَارِى [He used not
to persist in contention, &c.]: (Mgh, TA:) meaning accord. to Th, بِالشَّرِّ ↓ كَانَ لَا يَسْتَشْرِى [he
used not to persist, or persevere, with evil conduct]: (TA:) from اِسْتَشْرَى فِى عَدْوِهِ [expl. above
(see 1 near the end)] as said of a horse: (Mgh:)
or, accord. to Az, (TA,) originally يُشَارِرُ; one of
the رs being changed into ى. (K, * TA. [See 3
in art. شر: and see also 3 in art. جرى.])

-b4-  اشرى الحَمَلُ (K accord. to the CK,
[which, I think, evidently gives the right reading,]
in the TA and in my MS. copy of the K الجمل,)
i. q. تَفَلَّقَتْ عَقِيقَتُهُ [i. e. The lamb had its wool
cleaving open, or becoming cleft]: (K: [Freytag,
following the TK, and reading الحِمْلُ, explains
the verb as said of fruit, and meaning “ diffissos
habuit nucleos; ” but I cannot find any authority
for the signification that he thus assigns to عَقيقة:])
mentioned by Sgh. (TA.) ―
-b5-  اشرت الشَّجَرَةُ The
plant [crept upon the ground, or] was like the
cucumber and the melon; as also ↓ استشرت. (TA.)

bowls for the guests. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And He made it
to incline, (K, TA,) فِى نَاحِيَةِ كَذَا [in the direction of such a thing]. (TA.) Hence the saying of a poet,
وَأَنَّنِى حَيْثُمَا يُشْرِى الهَوَى بَصَرِى
مِنْ حَوْثَمَا سَلَكُوا أَدْنُو فَأَنْظُورُ
[And that I, wherever love makes my eye, or
eyes, to incline, wherever they travel, approach
and look: فانظور being for فَأَنْظُرُ]: or, as some
relate it, أَثْنِى فَأَنْظُورُ [i. e. turn myself, or my

الأَرْىِ وَأَمَرُّ مِنَ الشَّرْىِ [He, or it, is sweeter than
honey and more bitter than colocynth]. (TA.)

meaning An adjacent tract or region]; (S, K;)
as also ↓ شَرَآءٌ: (K:) accord. to some, of the right
hand: (TA:) pl. أَشْرَآءٌ. (S, K.) Hence, شَرَى
الفُرَاتِ The adjacent tract (نَاحِيَة) of the Euphrates: (TA:) and أَشْرَآءُ الحَرَمِ the adjacent
tracts of the Sacred Territory; syn. نَوَاحِيهِ. (S.)
―

-A2-  Also The bad, or
worse, or worst, of cattle: accord. to J, [in the
S,] ↓ شَرْىٌ, [said in the S to be like شَوَى المَالِ,]
which is [said to be] a mistake: (K:) but ElBedr El-Karáfee questions it being so: (TA:)
and the good, or better, or best, thereof; as also
↓ شَرَاةٌ: thus having two contr. significations:
(K:) and so says ISk: but ISd says that إِبِلٌ
↓ شَرَاةٌ, like سَرَاةٌ, means choice camels. (TA.)
-A3-
And A certain eruption upon the body, resembling
dirhems: (TA:) or small pimples or purulent
pustules, having a burning property: (S:) or
small pimples or purulent pustules, red, itching,
and distressing, generally originating at once,
(K, TA,) but sometimes gradually, (TA,) and
becoming [more] severe by night in consequence of
a hot vapour breaking forth at once upon the
body: (K, TA:) thus in the “ Kánoon ” of Ibn-Seenà [or Avicenna]. (TA.)

شِرًى, (S, TA,) an inf. n. of شَرَى, aor. يَشْرِى,
(TA,) [when used as a simple subst., signifying
A sale and also a purchase,] has أَشْرِيَةٌ for its pl.,
which, as pl. of a sing. of the measure فِعَلٌ, is
anomalous. (S, TA.)
شَرَاةٌ: see شَرًى, in two places.

شَرْوَى, in which the و is a substitute for ى, as
it is in تَقْوَى and the like, (TA,) The like (S, K)
of a thing: (S:) because a thing is sometimes
bought with the like thereof: (TA:) [used alike
as sing. and pl.: and, accord. to the TA, it seems
that ↓ شَرْىٌ signifies the same.] It is said of
Shureyh, كَانَ يُضَمِّنُ القَصَّارَ شَرْوَى الثَّوْبِ الَّذِى
أَهْلَكَهُ [He used to make the washer responsible
for the like of the garment, or piece of cloth, that
he destroyed]. (TA.) And it is said in a trad. of
'Omar, relating to the [collecting of the] poorrate, فَلَا يَأْخُذُ إِلَّا تِلْكَ السِّنَّ مِنْ شَرْوَى إِبِلِهِ [i. e.
And he shall not take any save of that age, of the
likes of his camels]. (TA.)
شِرَوِىٌّ, in which the و is a substitute for ى,

latter, of the inf. n. شِرَآءٌ. (Msb, TA.)
شَرْيَانٌ see شَرْىٌ: ―
-b2-  and see what next follows.
شِرْيَانٌ and ↓ شَرْيَانٌ, (S, K,) the former of which
is the more in repute, (TA,) the former said to be
quasi-quadriliteral, like جِرْيَالٌ, [and therefore
mentioned also in the TA in art. شرن,] but held
by IB to be of the measure فِعْلَانٌ, (TA in art.
شرن,) A kind of tree, (S, K, TA,) of the عِضَاه
[q. v.] of the mountains, (TA,) of which bows are
made: (S, K, TA:) n. un. with ة: the tree thus
called grows in the manner, and of the height and
width, of the [species of lote-tree called] سِدْر, and
has a yellow, sweet نَبِقَة [or drupe]: so says AHn:
and he adds, Aboo-Ziyád says, bows are made of
the شريان, and the bow made thereof is good, but
black tinged with redness; its wood being of those
woods of which good bows are [commonly] made;
and they assert that it seldom, or never, becomes
crooked: Mbr says that the نَبْع and شَوْحَط [q. v.]
and شريان are one kind of tree, but differing in
name and estimation according to the places of
growth; such thereof as is upon the summit of the
mountain being the نبع; and such as is at the base,
or foot, or lowest or lower part, thereof, the
شريان. (TA. [But see شَوْحَطٌ.]) ―
-b2-  Also sing. of
شَرَايِينُ signifying The arteries; i. e. the pulsing veins; (S, K;) which spring from the

-b3-  شِرْيَانٌ, with kesr, signifies also A crack,
or fissure, [in a rock,] such as is termed ثَتٌّ.
(Az, TA.)
شِرَائِىٌّ: see شِرَوِىٌّ.
شَارٍ Selling, or a seller: (Mgh, TA:) and
buying, or a buyer: as also ↓ مُشْتَرٍ [in both senses,
but generally in the latter sense; whereas شَارٍ is
generally used in the former sense]: (TA:) pl. of
the former شُرَاةٌ. (Mgh.) ―
-b2-  Also, (S, TA,) and
↓ شَارِىٌّ, in which latter the ى is not the ى of a
rel. n. but is an affix corroborative of the epithet,
as in the cases of أَحْوَرُ and أَحْوَرِىٌّ [or أَحْمَرُ and
أَحْمَرِىٌّ] and صُلَّبٌ and صُلَّبِىٌّ, (TA,) One of the
people to whom is applied the appellation الشُّرَاةُ,
(S, TA,) which means the [heretics, or schismatics, commonly known by the name of] خَوَارِج
[pl. of خَارِجِىٌّ, q. v.]: (S, M, Mgh, K, &c.:) so
called because they said, We have sold ourselves
in obedience to God, i. e., for Paradise, when we
separated ourselves from the erring Imáms: (S:)
or because they sold themselves for the sake of
what they believed: or because they said, Verily
God has purchased us and our possessions:
(Mgh:) but ISk says, because of their vehement
hatred of the Muslims: and the author of the K
says that it is from شَرِىَ signifying “ he was
angry,” and “ he persisted, or persevered; ” and
he charges J with error in his explaining it as
above, from their saying “ we have sold ourselves ” &c.; but this charge is senseless, for J
has followed herein more than one of the leading
authorities: the author of the K has followed ISd,
who, however, adds, as to themselves, they say
“ We are the شُرَاة ” because of the saying in the
Kur ii. 203 [cited in the first paragraph of this
art.], and the saying [in ix. 112] “ Verily God
hath purchased, of the believers, themselves ”
[&c.]; and the like is said in the Nh, with this
addition, that شُرَاةٌ is the pl. of شَارٍ; i. e., it is from
شَرَى, aor. يَشْرِى; or it may be from المُشَارَاةُ
meaning المُلَاجَّةُ: moreover, the part. n. of شَرِىَ
is شَرٍ; and this has not شُرَاةٌ for its pl. (TA.)
شَارِىٌّ: see the next preceding paragraph.
مُشْتَرٍ: see شَارٍ.
-A2-  المُشْتَرِى A certain star, (S,
K,) well-known; (K;) [Jupiter;] one of the Seven
Stars. (TA.)
