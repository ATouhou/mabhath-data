شرد1
شَرَدَ, aor.
شَرُدَ, inf. n. شُرُودٌ (S, L, Msb, K) and
شِرَادٌ, (S, L, K,) or the latter is a simple subst.,
(Msb,) and شُرَادٌ (K) and شَرْدٌ, (L,) said of a
camel, (S, A, L, Msb,) and of a horse or the like,
(L,) He took fright, or shied, and fled, or ran
away at random; or became refractory, and
went away at random, or ran away, or broke
loose, and went hither and thither by reason of
his sprightliness; syn. نَفَرَ, (S, L, Msb, K,) and
نَدَّ: (Msb:) and [simply] he fled, or ran away;
said of a camel &c. (Aboo-Bekr, TA.) The
saying of the Prophet, أَمَا يَشْرُدُ بِكَ بَعِيرُكَ (tropical:)  [Does
not thy camel take fright and run away with
thee?], addressed by him to Khowwát, who
answered, أَمَا مُنْذُ قَيَّدَهُ الإِسْلَامُ فَلَا [As to the
period since El-Islám shackled him, no], mentioned in the A, points to a story related of
Khowwát Ibn-Jubeyr, (TA,) that, being found
by the Prophet sitting by some strange women,
he endeavoured to excuse himself by saying that
he had a camel which took fright and ran away,
and he was seeking for something wherewith to
shackle him: the Prophet used afterwards to
taunt him by inquiring of him respecting the
running-away of his camel: what Kr says, and
J in the S [in art. نحى], is incorrect. (IAth,
L.) You say also, شَرَدَ عَنِّى فُلَانٌ Such a one
fled, or went away or aside or apart or to a distance, from me; syn. نَفَرَ. (A.) [Or] شَرَدَ said of
a man, inf. n. شُرُودٌ, means He departed, driven
away. (L.) And you say, شَرَدَ عَلَى اللّٰهِ, meaning
He departed from obedience to God, and seceded,
or separated himself from the community [of the
faithful]. (L.)

شرّدهُ, (L, Msb,) inf. n. تَشْرِيدٌ, (S, L, Msb,
K,) He made him to take fright, and flee, or run
away at random; or to become refractory, and to

and go hither and thither by reason of his sprightliness; namely, a camel [and a horse or the like:
see 1]: (Msb:) or he drove him away, or expelled
him; (S, * L, K; *) as also ↓ اشردهُ; (L;) [and so
شرّد بِهِ; for] you say شَرَّدْتُهُ عَنٍّى and شَرَّدْتُ بِهِ
[I drove him away from me]. (A.) And تَشْرِيدٌ
signifies also The act of dispersing, or scattering.
(K.) [Hence,] شَرِّدْ بِهِمْ مَنْ خَلْفَهُمْ, in the Kur
[viii. 59], means Disperse thou, or scatter thou,
by them, those [who shall come] after them: (S,
L:) or terrify thou, by them, those [who shall
come] after them: or make thou them notorious
