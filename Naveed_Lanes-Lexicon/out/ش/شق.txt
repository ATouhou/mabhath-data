open;] syn. صَدَعَهُ; (K;) or [more explicitly]
الشَّقُّ signifies الصَّدْعُ البَائِنُ [the cleaving &c. that
separates]; or غَيْرُ البَائِنِ [that which does not

general sense: (M:) and in like manner, [but

the staff] means (tropical:)  he separated himself from the

alike: but they differ in meaning, as will be
shown hereafter. (TA.) شَقَّ عَصَا المُسْلِمِينَ, K,
TA,) said of a خَارِجِىّ [i. e. heretic or schismatic],

flowing of the torrent,] is a saying mentioned by
IAar, but not expl. by him. (M. [It is there

property is divided between us as in the dividing

we are equal in respect of the property, or cattle:
for the ابلمة means the [kind of leaf called]
خُوصَة, which, when it is split lengthwise, splits
in halves: (M:) or, accord. to Aboo-Ziyád, the
ابلمة is a herb, or leguminous plant, (بَقْلَةٌ,) to
which there come forth pods, like [those of] the
bean; and when you split them lengthwise, they
split in halves, equally, from the first part to the

↓ تشقّق, said of lightning, signify اِنْعَقَّ [probably
meaning the same; (see عَقِيقَةٌ;) or, as expl. in the

of him: (Mgh:) accord. to Er-Rághib, the inf. n.
signifies the being in a شِقّ [or side] other than
that of one's fellow: or it is from شَقُّ العَصَا بَيْنَكَ
وَبَيْنَ صَاحِبِكَ [meaning “ the effecting disunion

relation between the two words in the letters and
in the order [thereof]; as in ضَرَبَ from الضَّرْبُ:
الاشتقاق الكَبِيرُ is that in which there is a reciprocal
relation between the two words as to the letter
and the meaning, exclusively of the order; as in
جَبَذَ from الجَذْبُ: الاشتقاق الأَكْبَرُ is that in
which there is a reciprocal relation between the
two words in the place [or places] of utterance;
as in نَعَقَ from النَّهْقُ. (KT.) [You say, اشتقّ
حَرْفًا or كَلِمَةً or لَفْظًا, and اسْمًا, He derived a
word, and a name, مِنْ آخَرَ from another; and
↓ شَقَّهُ sometimes signifies the same, as is shown

اِخْتِرَاعٌ, (see 8 in art. خرع,)] The constructing, or

the taking to the right and left in speech: (so in
a copy of the M: [but I think that the right
reading is الاِشْتِقَاقُ فِى الكَلَامِ, agreeably with
what here follows:]) you say, اشتقّ فِى الكَلَامِ, and

an incision, a gash, or a furrow, or trench]: (M,
K:) as though an inf. n. used as a subst. in this
sense: pl. as above, شُقُوقٌ: (M:) it differs from
شُقَاقٌ, (S, Mgh,) by having a general signification: (Mgh:) accord. to Yaakoob, one says,
بِيَدِ فُلَانٍ شُقُوقٌ (S, Mgh) and بِرِجْلِهِ (S) [i. e. In
the hand, or arm, of such a one are cracks, or the
like, and in his foot, or leg]: but [it is asserted
that in this case] one should not say شُقَاقٌ: (S,
Mgh: [see, however, this word:]) and hence,
شَقُّ القَبْرِ The trench, or oblong excavation, in the
middle of the grave: and accord. to As, شُقُوقٌ
signifies صُدُوع [i. e. fissures, &c.,] in mountains,
and in the earth, or ground. (Mgh.) ―

TA:) the vulgar pronounce the ش with fet-h.
(TA.) And خُذْ هٰذَا الشِّقَّ Take thou this ↓ شِقَّة
[i. e. half] of the sheep or goat. (TA.) Hence
the trad., تَصَدَّقُوا وَلَوْ بِشِقِّ تَمْرَةٍ i. e. [Give ye
alms though it be but] the half of a date; meaning
deem not anything little that is given as alms.
(TA.) And المَالُ بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَكَ شِقَّ الشَّعَرَةِ and
الشَّعَرَةِ ↓ شَقَّ, (O, K, * [in the CK and in my MS.
copy of the K شقُّ, but the former reading appears
to be the right, شَقَّ being an inf. n. as in a similar
saying in the former half of the first paragraph of
this art., and شِقَّ being a subst. used as an inf. n.
or for كَشِقِّ,]) meaning [The property is between
us] two halves, equal [in division]. (K.) ―

either of the two dorsers, or panniers, or oblong
chests, which are borne, one on either side, by a
camel, and which, with a small tent over them,
compose a مَحْمِل: see this last word, and مَحَارَةٌ].
(Mgh.) ―
-b4-  The side of the body; as when one
says of a person that his left شِقّ was grazed, or
abraded. (Mgh.) [Hence,] one says of a horse,
يَمِيلُ عَلَى أَحَدِ شِقَّيْهِ [He inclines, or leans, upon
one of his two sides]. (O.) [And مَشَى عَلَى شِقٍّ
and فِى شِقٍّ He went, or walked, inclining upon
one side.] ―
-b5-  The side, or lateral part, (Lth, Msb,
K, TA,) of a thing; the two sides of a thing
being called شِقَّاهُ: (Lth, TA:) or, as some say,

one says, فُلَانٌ مِنْ شِقِّ العَشِيرَةِ لَا مِنْ صَمِيمِهَا
(assumed tropical:)  [Such a one is of the collateral class of the
kinsfolk, or tribe, not of the main stock thereof].
(Mgh in art. عرض.) ―
-b6-  I. q. ↓ شَقِيقٌ; (S, Msb,
K;) [which primarily signifies The cloven-off
half of a thing; i. e.,] when a thing is cloven in
halves, each of the halves is called the شَقِيق of the
other. (S, K.) ―
-b7-  [And hence, (assumed tropical:)  The counterpart of a person or thing: and this appears to be
meant by J, and accord. to SM in the K, where
it is said that شِقٌّ is syn. with ↓ شَقِيقٌ; for they
add immediately after:] one says هُوَ أَخِى وَشِقُّ
نَفْسِى (tropical:)  [He is my brother, and the counterpart of
myself]; (S, TA;) as though he were cloven
from me, because of the resemblance of each of
us to the other. (TA.) One says also, هذَا
↓ شَقِيقُهُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  This is the like of him, or it.
(TA.) And [hence] it is said in a trad., النِّسَآءُ
شَقَائِقُ الرِّجَالِ, [in which شَقَائِقُ is the pl. of ↓ شَقِيقٌ
as fem., or of شَقِيقَةٌ in the same sense,] meaning

―
-b8-  And (tropical:)  A man's brother; (M;) and so ↓ شَقِيقٌ;
(S, M, O, K, TA;) meaning a brother by the
father and mother; (TA;) from شَقِيقٌ as meaning
“ either half of a thing that is cloven in halves; ”
(S, TA;) or as though the relationship of one
were cloven from that of the other: (IDrd, O,
K:) pl. of the latter أَشِقَّآءُ. (M, Msb.) ―
-b9-  And a
name for A thing at which one looks: (Lth, O,
K:) [but this is app. taken from the following
saying of Lth, in which I think الشِّقُّ is a mistranscription for الشَّقُّ, meaning “ the crack,” &c.:]
الشَّقُّ is the inf. n. of شَقَقْتُ, and الشِّقُّ is a name
for that at which one looks [i. e. for the visible
effect of the act signified by the verb], and the pl.
is الشُّقُوقُ [which is well known as the pl. of الشَّقُّ].
(JK.)
-A2-  Also i. q. ↓ مَشَقَّةٌ (S, M, O, Msb, K) i. e.
Difficulty, hardship, distress, affliction, trouble,
inconvenience, fatigue, or weariness; (M, TA;)
and languor, or lack of power, that overtakes the
mind and the body; (Er-Rághib, TA;) and so
↓ شَقٌّ; (IJ, S, M, O, K;) thus it is sometimes
pronounced with fet-h; mentioned by A'Obeyd;
(S;) and by AZ; (M;) or this is an inf. n., and
شِقٌّ is the subst.; (O, K;) and ↓ شُقَّةٌ and ↓ شِقَّةٌ
also signify the same as مَشَقَّةٌ, (K,) or such as
overtakes a man in consequence of travel; (TA;)
and the pls. of these two are شُقَقٌ, (K, TA,) mentioned by Fr, (TA,) and شِقَقٌ, (K, TA,) mentioned on the authority of some one or more of
[the tribe of] Keys: (TA:) the pl. of ↓ مَشَقَّةٌ is
مَشَاقُّ and مَشَقَّاتٌ. (TA.) Hence, in the Kur
[xvi. 7], لَمْ تَكُونُوا بَالِغِيهِ إِلَّا بِشِقِ الْأَنْفُسِ [Which
ye would not reach save with difficulty, or distress, &c., of the souls]; where some read ↓ بِشَقِّ.
(S, * TA.)
شُقَّةٌ primarily signifies The half of a garment
[consisting of two oblong pieces sewed together,
side by side]: then it was applied to [such] a
garment as it is [when complete: in both of these
senses it is used in the present day]: (Er-Rághib,

what are thus called congregate; and I think it
to be the ↓ شُقَيِّقَة, which is a دُخَّلَة of the دُخَّل
[q. v.]; it is somewhat dusky; and its form is the
form of these, but it is smaller than they: it is
called ↓ شُقَيِّقَة becanse of its smallness: IDrd, in
the class of فُعَيْعِل, mentions ↓ الشُّقَيِّقُ as signifying

-A4-  شَقَائِقُ النُّعْمَانِ,
used alike as sing. and pl., (S, O, K,) having no

Msb;) [The red, or blood-coloured, anemone;] a
certain plant; (M;) a certain red flower; (Lth,
O;) well known; (S, K;) the شَقِر; (Msb;) or, as
AHn says, on the authority of AA and Aboo-Nasr and others, it is the شَقِرَة [n. un. of شَقِرٌ];
and the sing. of شقائق is شَقِيقَةٌ: (O, TA:) it is
called شقائق النعمان because of its redness, as
being likened to the شَقِيقَة of lightning: (M, K:)
or from النُّعْمَان as meaning “ blood,” as resembling
blood in colour; (Msb, TA;) so that it signifies
“ pieces of blood: ” (TA:) or in relation to En-Noamán Ibn-El-Mundhir, because he prohibited
to the public a piece of land in which it abounded:
(S, K, TA:) or because he alighted upon شَقَائِق
of sand that had produced red شَقِر, and he deemed
them beautiful, and commanded that they should
be prohibited to the public; so the شَقِر were called
the شقائق of En-Noamán, by the name of the
place of their growth. (TA.)

Devil, in his saying, إِنَّ كَثِيرًا مِنَ الخُطَبِ مِنْ
شَقَاشِقِ الشَّيْطَانِ [lit. Verily many of the orations,

rendered and I stepped wide, like as does the tall,
