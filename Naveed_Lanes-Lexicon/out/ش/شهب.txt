شَهَّبَ see the preceding paragraph, in three places.

اشهب, said of a stallion, He had offspring
of the colour termed شُهْبَة born to him: so accord.
to the K: but accord. to IM and the other
lexicologists, it is said of a man, meaning the
offspring of his horses were of the colour termed
شُهْبَة: IAar says that there are not, among horses,
such as are termed شُهْبٌ [pl. of أَشْهَبُ]: A' Obeyd,
however, [as will be seen below,] explains شُهْبَة
as meaning a colour of horses. (TA.) ―

voce عَضْبٌ. [See also شِهَابٌ.])
شَهَبٌ: see what next follows.
شُهْبَةٌ A [gray] colour in which whiteness predominates over blackness, (S, Msb,) or in which
whiteness is interrupted by blackness; as also
↓ شَهَبٌ; (A, K;) which latter is [properly] an
inf. n., of شَهِبَ: (S, Msb:) or whiteness mixed
with blackness: (Har p. 150:) not pure whiteness,
as some have imagined it to be. (TA.) And in
horses, A colour in which the main hue is interrupted by a hoariness, or by some white hairs,
whether the horse be [in his general colour]
كُمَيْت or أَشْقَر or أَدْهَم. (A' Obeyd, TA.)
شَهَبَانٌ A kind of plant (شَجَرٌ), resembling the
ثُمَام [or panic grass]; (K;) like شَبَهَانٌ. (TA.

شِهَابٌ, in its primary acceptation, A شُعْلَة [i. e.
either brand or flame (app. the former, agreeably
with what follows,)] of fire: (TA:) or a شُعْلَة
of fire gleaming or radiating: (S, K:) accord. to
ISk, a firebrand; i. e. a stick in which is fire:
or, accord. to AHeyth, originally, a piece of wood,
or stick, in which is fire gleaming or radiating:
(Az, TA:) pl. شُهُبٌ, (S, K,) and some allow شُهْبٌ,
(TA,) and شُهْبَانٌ (Akh, S, K) and شِهْبَانٌ, (K,)
which is strange, (TA,) and أَشْهُبٌ, (K,) which
last is [a pl. of pauc., but] thought by IM to be a
quasi-pl. n. (TA.) The reading بِشِهَابِ قَبَسٍ, instead
of بِشِهَابٍ قَبَسٍ, in the Kur [xxvii. 7], is an
instance of a word prefixed to another identical
therewith. (Fr. L.) ―
-b2-  Hence, [A shooting, or
falling, star;] a star, or the like of a star, that
darts down [or is hurled] by night; and particularly after a devil; as occurring in the Kur [xv.
18 and] xxxvii. 10; and in a trad.; respecting

uttered in heaven. (TA.) ―
-b3-  [Hence also,] الشُّهُبُ
signifies The shining, or brightly-shining, stars:
(K:) or the seven stars [or planets; meaning,
not the Pleiades (which are called النَّجْمُ), but
the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars,
Jupiter, and Saturn: the first three of which are
said by Freytag to be called صِغَارُ الشُّهُبِ]. (TA.)
―
-b4-  For another meaning assigned in the K to
الشُّهُبُ, see الشُّهْبُ, voce أَشْهَبُ. ―
-b5-  شِهَابٌ also signifies (tropical:)  One who is penetrating, sharp, or energetic,
in an affair; (K, TA;) as being likened to the
[shooting] star. (TA.) One says, إِنَّ فُلَانًا لَشِهَابُ
حَرْبٍ (tropical:)  Verily such a man is one who is penetrating, sharp, or energetic, in war. (S, A. *) And
هٰؤُلَآءِ شُهْبَانُ الجَيْشِ (tropical:)  [These are the braves, or
heroes, of the army]. (A.) ―
-b6-  Also the name of
A certain devil: occurring in a trad.: hence the
Prophet changed the name of a certain man
[originally] thus named. (TA.)
شُهَابَةٌ: see شَهَابٌ.
كَتِيبَةٌ شَهَّابَةٌ: see أَشْهَبُ.
شَاهِبٌ: see أَشْهَبُ, first sentence.

أَشْهَبُ Of the colour termed شُهْبَةٌ; (S, Msb,
K;) as also ↓ شَاهِبٌ, (K,) occurring in the poetry
of Hudheyl: (TA:) fem. of the former شَهْبَآءُ:
(S, Msb, K: *) and pl. شُهْبٌ: (O:) the former
epithet is applied to a horse, (S,) [contr. to an
assertion of IAar, (see 4,)] and to a he-mule,
(Msb,) and شَهْبَآءُ to a she-mule. (Mgh, Msb.)
[Golius, on the authority of Meyd, explains
أَشْهَبُ أَدْهَمُ, applied to a horse, as meaning Subniger, spadiceus: and أَشْهَبُ أَخْضَرُ as meaning
lucide leviterve viridis: the correct meaning of
the former seems to be of a blackish, or brownish,
gray: and that of the latter, of a dark dustcoloured gray: see أَدْهَمُ and أَخْضَرُ.] الشَّهْبَآءُ was
the name of a mare belonging to El-Kattál ElBejelee. (O, K; in the CK El-Bejlee.) Applied
to a she-goat, شَهْبَآءُ signifies Of a white colour
intermixed with black: thus applied, it is like
مَلْحَآءُ applied to a ewe. (K.) Applied to a غُرَّة
[or blaze on a horse's forehead], it means In
which are hairs differing from the whiteness [of
the blaze]. (S.) And الأَشَاهِبُ is [a pl. formed
from الأَشْهَبُ as though this were a subst.] applied
to the Benu-l-Mundhir, (K,) or one of the troops
of En-Noamán Ibn-El-Mundhir, consisting of the
sons of his paternal uncle and his maternal uncles,
and their brethren; (TA;) so called because of
their comeliness, (K,) or because of the whiteness
of their faces. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Applied to ambergris,
(K, TA,) (assumed tropical:)  Of an excellent colour, i. e., (TA,)
inclining to whiteness. (K, TA.) And applied to
an iron head or blade of an arrow or of a spear
&c., (tropical:)  That has been filed so that its blackness has
gone: (S, A, TA:) or that has been filed lightly,
so that all its blackness has not gone. (AHn,
TA.) [Hence,] كَتِيبَةٌ شَهْبَآءُ (assumed tropical:)  A great troop having
numerous weapons; (K;) so called because of
the iron; (S;) or because of the whiteness of the
weapons and iron, intermixed with blackness: or

armour] is white and bright: (TA:) or, as also
↓ كَتِيبَةٌ شَهَّابَةٌ, a troop upon which is [seen] the
whiteness of the iron [weapons &c.]. (T, TA.
[See also كَتِيبَةٌ مَلْحَآءُ, voce أَمْلَحُ.]) And جَيْشٌ

weapons]. (TA.) ―
-b3-  أَرْضٌ شَهْبَآءُ (assumed tropical:)  A land in which
is no verdure, by reason of the paucity of rain.
(TA.) And [hence,] سَنَةٌ شَهْبَآءُ (tropical:)  A year of
drought, or sterility, white in consequence thereof,
(TA,) in which is no verdure, or in which is no
rain: (K, TA:) next in degree is the بَيْضَآء; then,
the حَمْرَآء, which is more severe than the بَيْضَآء;
(TA;) and then, the سَوْدَآء: (TA in art. حمر:)
or a year that is white by reason of the abundance
of snow and the want of herbage: (IB, TA:) or
a year of drought, or sterility; because the seedproduce dries up therein, and becomes yellow:
and عَامٌ أَشْهَبُ signifies the same. (Har p. 150.)
And أَشْهَبَانِ (assumed tropical:)  Two white years (عَامَانِ أَبْيَضَانِ)
between which is no verdure (K, TA) of herbage.
(TA.) And يَوْمٌ أَشْهَبُ (tropical:)  A cold day: (A, K:) or
a day of cold wind; thought to be so called on
account of the snow and hoar frost and hail
therein: (L, TA:) or a day of hoar-frost: (Az,
TA:) a day of cold wind and hoar frost; and
[in like manner] the night (اللَّيْلَةُ) is termed شَهْبَآءُ.
(S.) In the following verse, cited by Sb,
فِدًى لِبَنِى ذُهْلِ بْنِ شَيْبَانَ نَاقَتِى
إِذَا كَانَ يَوْمٌ ذُو كَوَاكِبَ أَشْهَبُ
[May my she-camel be a ransom for the sons of
Dhuhl Ibn-Sheybán when there is a day of difficulties, or distresses, . . .] the meaning may be
اشهب [or whitish] by reason of the whiteness of the
weapons, or by reason of the dust. (TA.) And
الشُّهْبُ [pl. of أَشْهَبُ], (O,) or ↓ الشُّهُبُ [pl. of شِهَابٌ],
(K,) [but the former, I think, is evidently the
right,] (assumed tropical:)  The white nights; (اللَّيَالِى البِيضُ;) [i. e.
the thirteenth and fourteenth and fifteenth nights
of the lunar month; so called because lighted by
the moon throughout, (see art. بيض;)] (O;)
three nights of the month; (K, TA;) because of
the alteration of their colour. (TA.) ―
-b4-  أَشْهَبُ [or
أَمْرٌ أَشْهَبُ] also signifies (assumed tropical:)  A hard, or difficult,
affair or case, (K, TA,) such as is disliked, or
hated. (TA.) And أَشْهَبُ بَازِلٌ (assumed tropical:)  A hard, or difficult, affair or case, that is beyond one's power
[of accomplishment or endurance]: termed بازل
because the camel thus termed is one that has
attained its utmost strength. (O, TA. [See also
art. بزل.]) ―
-b5-  And الأَشْهَبُ signifies The lion. (O,
K.) [And in the Deewán of Jereer, it is applied
to The swine. (Freytag.)]
