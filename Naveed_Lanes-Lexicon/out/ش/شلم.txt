شَيْلَمٌ The رُؤَان [now applied to darnel-grass
(but see this latter word زؤان)] that is [often
found] in wheat; also called ↓ شَالَمٌ (Msb, K) and
↓ شَوْلَمٌ; (K;) of Pers., or foreign, origin; (أَصْلُهُ
أَعْجَمِىٌّ;) and it is said that one of its two extremities is sharp and the other thick: (Msb:)
of the dial. of the Sawád: accord. to IAar, i. q.
زِيوَان [sic.] and سَعِيع: AHn says that it is a
small, oblong, red, erect grain, resembling in form
the سُوس [or grub] of wheat; and it does not
intoxicate, but renders the wheat very bitter: and
in one place he says, the plant of the شيلم spreads
upon the ground, and its leaves are like those of
the خِلَاف [or salix Aegyptia] that is termed
بَلْخِىّ, very green, and juicy, or tender; people eat
its leaves when they are fresh, and they are
pleasant [to the taste], without bitterness; but its
grain is more intensely, or nauseously, bitter
(أَعْقَى) than aloes. (TA.) [Forskål, in his Flora
Aegypt. Arab. p. 199, after describing the زؤان,
says, “شيلم etiam agri vitium; a priore tamen
diversa species: decocto plantæ obtunduntur sensus
hominis qui operationem chirurgicam subire
debet; Avicenna sic referente. ” See also سَكَرَةٌ.]
-A2-  [Golius says, on the authority of a gloss in a
copy of the KL, that it signifies also A short, or
little, avaricious, man; “ vir curtus, avarus: ”
a meaning, if correct, app. tropical.]
