شل1
شَلَّتْ يَمِينُهُ, (S, O,) or يَدُهُ, (Mgh, TA,) or
اليَدُ, (Msb, K,) originally شَلِلَتْ, (Mgh, Msb,
TA,) aor. تَشَلُّ, (S, O, &c.,) inf. n. شَلَلٌ (S, * O, *
Mgh, Msb, K) and شَلٌّ, (Msb, K,) or the latter
is not allowable; (Ham p. 69;) this is the chaste
form of the verb; (Th, TA;) and ↓ أُشِلَّتْ; (Th,
K;) and شُلَّتْ, (Th, O, K,) but this last is bad,
(Th, O, TA,) and is disallowed by Fr; (TA;)
His right hand or arm, or his hand or arm, or
the hand or arm, was, or became, unsound, or
vitiated: (S, O, TA:) or deprived of the power of
motion by an unsound, or a vitiated, state of its
عُرُوق [meaning veins or nerves]: (Msb:) or
dried up; or stiff: or it went [or wasted] away.
(K, TA.) One says, in praying for a person,
لَا تَشْلَلْ يَدُكَ [May thy hand, or arm, not become
unsound, &c.]: (S, Msb, * K: *) and لَا شَلَلًا and
↓ لَا شَلَالِ, which mean the same; the last word
like قَطَامِ. (K.) And شَلَّ عَشْرُهُ, and خَمْسُهُ, [His
ten fingers became unsound, &c., and his five
fingers,] and some say شَلَّتْ, but this is more
rare; i. e., the suppression of the fem. ت is more
usual in a case of this kind. (Lh, TA.) To one
who has shot or thrown, or who has pierced or
thrust, well, one says, لَا شَلَلًا وَلَا عَمًى [Mayest
thou not experience unsoundness, &c., nor blindness]; and لَا شَلَّ عَشْرُكَ [May thy ten fingers not
become unsound, &c.], meaning أَصَابِعُكَ. (S, O.)
He who says شَلَّ المَارِنُ and شَلَّتِ الأُذُنُ is a
foreigner. (Mgh.) The lawyers [improperly] use
الشَّلَل in relation to the ذَكَر. (Msb.) One says
also, شَلِلْتَ يَا رَجُلُ [Thou hast become unsound,
&c., in thy hand or thine arm, O man]. (S, O.)
And لَا شَلَلَ, meaning لَا تَشْلَلْ, because it occupies the place of an imperative. (Lth, TA.) In
the saying of the rájiz, (S,) namely, Abu-l-Khudree
El-Yarboo'ee, (O, TA,)
مُهْرَ أَبِى الجَبْحَابِ لَا تَشَلِّى
[Colt of Abu-l-Habháb, mayest thou not become
unsound, &c., in the fore leg], (S, TA, [in the O,
ابى الحَرِثِ, for ابى الحٰرِثِ,]) the last word is
thus [for لا تَشْلَلْ] on account of the rhyme: (S,
O, TA:) [for] the next hemistich is
بَارَكَ فِيكَ اللّٰهُ مِنْ ذِى أَلِّ
[God bless thee as one possessing fleetness, or
swiftness]; (O, TA;) ذى الّ in this instance
meaning ذى سُرْعَةٍ. (S in art. ال.)

شَلُ3َ, (S, Msb,) inf. n. شَلٌّ (S, O, Msb, K *)
and شَلَلٌ, (K, * and Ksh in xii. 3,) like as قَصَصٌ
is inf. n. of قَصَّ, (Ksh ibid.,) or شَلَلٌ is a simple
subst.; (S, O;) He drove him away; (K;) and
I drove away (S, O, Msb) the camels, (S, O,)
and the man. (Msb.) And مَرَّ فُلَانٌ يَشُلُّهُمْ بِالسَّيْفِ
Such a one passed along urging them on, and
driving them, with the sword. (S.) [See also 4.

Msb, TA,) slightly; (S, O, TA; [omitted, probably by inadvertence, in my copy of the Msb;])

strangely omitted in the K: ↓ شِلَالَةٌ is [app. a
subst., not an inf. n., signifying The act, or art, of
so sewing;] the contr. of كِفَافَةٌ. (TA.)
4
اشلّ يَمِينَهُ, (S,) or يَدَهُ, (Fr, K,) He (i. e.

made the hand or arm to become deprived of the
power of motion by an unsound, or a vitiated,
state of its عُرُوق [meaning veins or nerves].
(Msb.) And اشلّ اللّٰه يَدَهُ is said by way of
imprecation [as meaning May God render his
hand or arm unsound, &c.]. (O.) See also 1,
first sentence.
