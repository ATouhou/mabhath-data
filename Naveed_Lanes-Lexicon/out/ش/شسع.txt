شِسْعٌ (S, O, Msb, K, &c.) and شِسِعٌ (K) and
↓ شِسْعَنٌّ, so in some of the copies of the K, (TA,)
[thus in my MS. copy of the K, and also in the
O,] with an augmentative ن, (O, TA,) The قِبَال
of the sandal; (K;) [i. e.] the appertenance of
the sandal that is attacked, or tied, to its زِمَام;
(S;) [meaning] one of the thongs, or straps, or
strips of leather, of the sandal, being that which
passes between two toes, of which the [lower]
end enters the hole, or perforation, that is in the
fore part of the sandal, and which is attacked
[at its upper end] to the زِمَام [or, as it is also
called, the شِرَاك, a thong, or strap, or strip of
leather, extending towards the ankle, and having
two arms, (its عَضُدَانِ,) which are attacked to
the أُذُنَانِ (q. v.), or pass through these and unite
behind the foot]: (IAth, TA:) a poet says, referring to camels,
↓ أَحْدُو بِهَا مُنْقَطِعًا شِسْعَنِّى
[I urge them on by singing to them, with the
interdigital thong of my sandal broken]: (Lth, O,
TA:) the pl. of شِسْعٌ is شُسُوعٌ (S, O, Msb, K,
TA) and أَشْسَاعٌ: (O, K, TA:) ISd and Z affirm
that it has only the former pl.; but AHei contradicts this: (TA:) the latter pl. [a pl. of pauc.]
occurs in the saying of 'Obeyd Ibn-Eiyoob El-
'Amberee,
يُدِيرُ نَعْلَيْهِ لِئَلَّا تُعْرَفَا
يَجْعَلُ أَشْسَاعَهُمَا نَحْوَ القَفَا
[He turns round his sandals, in order that they
may not be known by their prints upon the ground;
putting the interdigital thongs thereof in the
direction of the back of the neck]. (O, TA.) ―
-b2-
[Hence,] قِبَالُ الشِّسْعِ signifies (assumed tropical:)  The serpent;
mentioned by IAar with قِبَالُ الشِّبْرِ. (TA.) ―
-b3-
And شِسْعٌ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  The extremity of a
place. (O, K.) One says, حَلَلْنَا شِسْعَ الدَّهْنَآءِ
(assumed tropical:)  [We alighted in the extremity of the sandy
desert, or of the desert called Ed-Dahnà]. (O.)
―
-b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  A narrow tract of land. (O, K.) ―
-b5-
And (tropical:)  Somewhat remaining of property or cattle.
(IAar, O, K, TA.) And (K) (tropical:)  A small quantity
or number of property or cattle. (Mohárib, O,
K, TA.) One says, لَهُ شِسْعُ مَالٍ (tropical:)  He has a small
quantity of property, or a small number of cattle;
(Mohárib, O, K, TA;) or a small collection of
camels and of sheep or goats: (K, TA:) and Fr
adds مَالٍ ↓ شَسِيعُ [app. in the same sense: but see
another explanation of شِسْعُ مَالٍ in what follows].
(O.) ―
-b6-  And (tropical:)  The greater portion or number of
property or cattle. (El-Mufaddal, O, K, TA.)
Thus it has two contr. [?] significations. (K.)
One says, ذَهَبَ شِسْعُ مَالِهِ (tropical:)  The greater portion
of his property, or the greater number of his
cattle, went, or passed, away. (El-Mufaddal, O,
TA.) ―
-b7-  And فُلَانٌ شِسْعُ مَالٍ (tropical:)  Such a one is a
good manager of cattle or camels &c.; (S, O, K,
TA;) one who keeps assiduously to the tending, or
pasturing, thereof: (A, TA:) and Fr says, هُوَ
مَالٍ ↓ شَسِيعُ, as syn. with شِسْعُ مَالٍ. (TA: [but
see above.])
شِسْعَنٌّ: see شِسْعٌ, in two places.
شَسُوعٌ: see شَاسِعٌ.
شَسِيعُ مَالٍ: see شِسْعٌ, in two places.
شَاسِعٌ A man having his شِسْع broken. (O, K.)
―
-b2-  Also Distant, or remote; and so ↓ شَسُوعٌ:
(S, O, K:) both applied to a place of alighting, or
abode: (O, K:) pl. [of either, irreg.,] شُسْعٌ. (K.)
One says بِلَادٌ شَاسِعَةٌ [Distant countries or towns].
(Msb.) And رَجُلٌ شَاسِعُ الدَّارِ A man whose
house, or abode, or country, is distant. (TA.)
And شَفَرٌ شَاسِعٌ A far journey. (TA.)
