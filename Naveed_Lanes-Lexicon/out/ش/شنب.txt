شَنِبَ, aor.
شَنَبَ, (K,) inf. n. شَنَبٌ, (TA,) He
had the quality termed شَنَبٌ meaning as expl.
below. (K.) ―
-b2-  And It (a day) was, or became,
cool, or cold. (A, K.)
شَنَبٌ Lustre, and fineness, or delicacy, or thinness, and coolness, and sweetness, in the teeth:
(A, K:) or lustre, and fineness, or delicacy, or
thinness, in the fore teeth: (TA:) or these two
qualities, together with coolness and sweetness, in
the mouth, accord. to As, or in the teeth: (TA:)
or coolness and sweetness in the teeth: or sharpness of the teeth: (S:) or sharpness of the canine
teeth, like غَرْبٌ, so that they appear like a saw:
(K:) or white specks in the teeth: (A, K:) or the
state of the teeth when they appear somewhat
tinged with blackness, like the appearance of
blackness in hail; غُرُوبٌ signifying the “ lustre ”
of the teeth; and ظَلْمٌ, their “ whiteness that is as
though there were over it a blackness: ” (ISh,
TA:) Abu-l-'Abbás says, It is variously expl., as
a serrated state of the teeth: and their clearness
and cleanness: and their being separate, or apart,
one from another: and the sweetness of their
odour: (TA:) El-Jarmee says, I heard As say
that this word signifies coolness of the mouth and
teeth; and I said, Our companions say that it is
their sharpness when they come forth; by which
is meant their new, or recent, and fresh state; for
when they have undergone the lapse of years,
they become abraded, or worn: but he said, It is
nothing but their coolness: and the saying of
Dhu-r-Rummeh,
وَفِى اللِّثَاتِ وَفِى أَنْيَابِهَا شَنَبُ
[which should be rendered And in the gums, and
in her canine teeth, is coolness], corroborates the
assertion of As; for there is no sharpness in the
gum: (S, L, TA:) it is also related of As that he
said, I asked Ru-beh respecting the meaning of
شَنَبٌ, and he took a grain of pomegranate, and
pointed to its lustre: (Mz, TA:) [and ↓ شُنْبَةٌ signifies the same:] a poet says,
مُنَصَّبُهَا حَمْشٌ أَحَمُّ يَزِينُهُ
عَوَارِضُ فِيهَا شُنْبَةٌ وَغُرُوبُ
[Her even set of front teeth are slender and white,
side teeth in which are coolness and lustre adorning
them]. (O, TA.) ―
-b2-  [In the present day, it signifies The mustache.]
شَنِبٌ and ↓ شَانِبٌ, (A, K,) the former regular,
the latter on the authority of usage, (TA,) A cool,
or cold, day. (A, K.)
شُنْبَةٌ Coolness, or coldness, of a day. (O, K.)
―

شَانِبٌ: see شَنِبٌ: ―

أَشْنَبُ Having the quality termed شَنَبٌ meaning
as expl. above; (A, O, K;) as also ↓ شَانِبٌ, (K,)
which is irregular, (TA,) and ↓ شَنِيبٌ, (K,)
[which is likewise irregular;] but the first of
these three is the most common: (TA:) applied
to a man, (O,) and to the ثَغْر [or front teeth],
(A,) [and to the mouth, as in a verse cited voce
زَرْنَبٌ:] fem. شَنْبَآءُ, (S, O, K,) applied to a woman,
(S, O,) and also written شَمْبَآءُ, (K,) the ن being
changed into م because of the following ب, and
