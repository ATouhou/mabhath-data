شرولشِرْوَالٌ is [said to be] a dial. var. of سِرْوَالٌ:
(K:) IAmb says that Es-Sijistánee mentions his
having heard some of the Arabs of the desert say
شِرْوَال for سِرْوَال; but that it seems he heard them
use the Pers. word, [which, it appears, is شَرْوَال
as well as شَلْوَار,] and knew it not: (O, TA: *)
شروال is a vulgar word, [now commonly pronounced شَرْوَال,] and some of the vulgar say
شَلْوَار, with fet-h to the ش. (TA.)
