state of body, and active and grown up, and vied
with his mother in his faculties [so I render
مَالَكَ أُمَّهُ of which I do not find any explanation]
so that he went along with her; and [in this sense]
it is said of a colt also: (TA:) or, said of a
young gazelle, he became strong, and his horns
came forth, and he became in no need of his
mother: and sometimes it is said of a colt [in a
similar sense]. (S.) Hence, it is said of a boy,
