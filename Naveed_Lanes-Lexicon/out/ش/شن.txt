R. Q. 1
شَنْشَنَةٌ [an inf. n., of which the verb,
if it be used, is شَنْشَنَ,] The motion of paper, and
of a new garment: [or rather the making a kind
of crackling sound by the motion thereof:] mentioned by Az in art. فقع: (TA:) and نَشْنَشَةٌ signifies the same: both thus expl. by IAar. (TA
in art. قع.)
شَنٌّ A skin, (Msb,) or a water-skin, (S,
Mgh,) or a small water skin, (K,) or, as some
say, any vessel made of skin, (TA,) applied
by a poet to a دَلْو [or leathern bucket], (Ham
p. 602,) that is old, and worn out; (S, Mgh,
Msb, K, TA;) and so ↓ شَنَّةٌ; (S, K;) but app.
one that is small: (S: [in which this addition
to the explanation seems to relate peculiarly to
the latter word: see an ex. of this latter word in
some verses cited in the first paragraph of art.
سقى:]) or both signify an old water-skin; as
also ↓ مِشَنٌّ: (MA:) and ↓ شَنَنٌ, also, signifies
an old, worn-out, water-skin: (TA:) pl. (of the
first, Mgh, Msb) شِنَانٌ: (S, Mgh, Msb, K:) and
Lh mentions the phrase قِرْبَةٌ أَشْنَانٌ, as though
they applied the term شَنٌّ to every portion of the
قربة and then pluralized it thus; but he says that
he had not heard أَشْنَانٌ as a pl. of شَنٌّ except in
this case: (TA:) the water in a شَنّ is cooler
[than that in a skin not so old]. (Mgh.) It is
said in a prov., لَا يُقَعْقَعُ لِى بِالشِّنَانِ [A confused
and clattering noise will not be made to me with
the old and worn-out water-skins to frighten me]:
(S in the present art.: [in the S and K in art.
قع, with مَا in the place of لا; and in the K in
that art., with لَهُ in the place of لى:]) مَا يُقَعْقَعُ لَهُ
بِالشِّنَانِ is applied to him who will not be abased
by misfortunes, nor frightened by that which has
no reality: (Sgh and K in art. قع:) or it means,
he will not be deceived nor frightened: شِنَان
being pl. of شَنٌّ, a dried up skin, which is shaken
to a camel to frighten him. (L and TA in art.
قع.) An old man is likened to the skin thus
termed. (Har p. 675.) And ↓ شَنَّةٌ signifies also
(tropical:)  A worn-out old woman; as being likened to the
skin thus termed. (IAar, TA.) And one says,
رَفَعَ فُلَانٌ الشَّنَّ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  Such a man raised
himself bearing upon the palm of his hand. (IKh,
TA.) ―
-b2-  Also i. q. غرض [app. غَرَضٌ, i. e. A butt,
at which one shoots or casts: probably because
an old water-skin was sometimes used as a butt]:
pl. as above. (Msb.) ―

on the authority of Meyd, (assumed tropical:)  Dry herbage.]

called because some of his fatness has gone:
(Aboo-Kheyreh, TA:) one says مَهْزُولٌ; then
مُنْقٍ, when he has become a little fat; then شَنُونٌ;
then سَاحٌّ; and then مُثَرْطِمٌ, when fat in the utmost
degree: (Lh, TA:) so says Aboo-Ma'add El-Kilá-
bee. (TA in art. سح.) [But it is said that] it signifies
also Lean, or emaciated; (K;) applied to a beast:
(TA:) and fat: thus having two contr. meanings. (K.) ―
-b2-  Also Hungry: (S, K:) applied
in this sense by Et-Tirimmáh to a wolf, because
this animal is not described as fat or lean. (S.)

شَانَّةٌ The [channel called] مَدْفَع [q. v.] of a
small valley: or a small مَدْفَع of a valley: (TA:
[the want of a vowel-sign in my original renders
it doubtful which of these meanings is the right
one:]) or شَوَانُّ, its pl., signifies the channels of
water, of mountains, that pour forth into valleys
from a rugged place. (AA, TA.)
شِنْشِنَةٌ A nature; or a natural, a native, or an

a prov.: (Meyd, Mgh:) [of its origin there are
different explanations: see Freytag's Arab. Prov.
i. 658, and Har pp. 591 and 596:] أَخْزَمُ is the
proper name of a man: (Meyd, Mgh, &c.:) or
accord. to Lth, it is an epithet applied to a penis;
one says كَمَرَةٌ خَزْمَآءُ “ a glans of a penis having a
short frænum,” and ذَكَرٌ أَخْزَمُ; and شنشنة means
the dropping of water [i. e., in this case, of the
seminal fluid]: (Meyd:) the prov. is applied in
relation to nearness of resemblance. (Meyd,
Mgh.)
-A2-  Also A bit of flesh-meat, as much as is
chewed at once; syn. مُضْغَةٌ: or a piece of flesh-meat; (K, TA;) and so نِشْنِشَةٌ: on the authority
