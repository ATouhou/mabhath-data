شرم1
شَرَمَهُ, (S, K,) aor.
شَرِمَ, (K,) inf. n. شَرْمٌ, i. q.
شَقَّهُ [meaning He slit it; or rent it; and perhaps
also he clave it, split it, &c.]. (S, K.) ―
-b2-  It is
also said in the K that الشَّرْمُ signifies قَطْعُ مَا بَيْنَ
الأَرْنَبَةِ: but ما بين should be struck out: and the
passage, moreover, is defective: it should be, as
in the M, الشَّرْمُ and ↓ التَّشْرِيمُ signify The cutting
(قَطْع [or rather شَقّ i. e. slitting or rending]) of
the end, or tip, of the nose, and of the ثَفْر [here
meaning the vulva, or the orifice of the vagina,]
of a she-camel: specially said of these two things.
(TA. [See also 2; and see شَرِيمٌ.]) ―
-b3-  شَرَمَ الثَّرِيدَةَ,
aor. and inf. n. as above, and the latter, by poetic
license, شَرَمٌ, He ate of the sides, or of the edge,
of the ثريدة [or mess of crumbled bread moistened
with broth]. (TA.) ―
-b4-  شَرَمَ لَهُ مِنْ مَالِهِ, (S, K,)
aor. as above, (K,) and so the inf. n., (TA,) He
gave him little of his مال (i. e. property, or cattle]. (S, K.)
-A2-  شَرِمَ, aor.
شَرَمَ, is quasi-pass. of شَرَمَهُ;
[i. e. it signifies It was, or became, slit, or rent;]
(TA;) as also ↓ انشرم. (S, TA. [In the former
it is implied that the meaning of the latter verb is
اِنْشَقَّ.]) ―
-b2-  Also, aor. as above, (Msb,) inf. n.
شَرَمٌ, (S, * Msb, K, *) He (a man) had his nose
slit: (Msb:) or he had the end, or tip, of his nose
cut. (S, * Msb, K. *)

تَشْرِيمٌ i. q. تَشْقِيقٌ [meaning The slitting, or
rending, and perhaps also cleaving, splitting, &c.,
much, or in several places]: (S, K, TA: [see 2 in
art. خرم:]) one says, شرّمهُ [he slit it &c.], in relation to the ear &c.: (TA:) [it is used in relation
to the end, or tip, of the nose; and to the orifice
of the vagina of a she-camel; as shown above:]
see 1, second sentence. تَشْرِيمُ الظِّئَارِ is [The scarifying of the vulva, or of the orifice of the vagina,
for the purpose of] the making a she-camel to
affect and suckle a young one not her own [by
causing her to imagine, from the pain thus occasioned, that she has recently brought forth that
young one]; (TA;) تشريم in this phrase signifying
تَشْقِيق. (T in art. ظأر.) It is said in a trad. of
Ibn-'Omar, that he purchased a she-camel, and,
seeing in her what is thus termed, returned her:
(S:) in this instance, تشريم الظئار means The
laceration of the two edges of the vulva on the
occasion of ظئار. (T and TA in art. ظأر: see 1 in
that art.) ―
-b2-  تَشْرِيمُ الصَّيْدِ is The wounding of the
skin of the animal of the chase without piercing
into the belly, or inside, (L in art. حق, [see 8
in that art.,]) so that the animal escapes wounded.
(S, K. *)
5
تشرّم, (S, K,) said of the skin, (TA,) or of
a thing, (S,) It was, or became, rent, or slit, in
several places; (S, K, TA;) quasi-pass. of شَرَّمَهُ.
(TA.) It is said in a trad. of Kaab, أَتَى عُمَرَ
بِكِتَابٍ قَدْ تَشَرَّمَتْ نَوَاحِيهِ i. e. تَشَقَّقَتْ [meaning
He brought to 'Omar a book of which the sides

شَرِيمٌ A woman having her vagina and rectum
united by the rending of the separation between
them; syn. مُفْضَاةٌ; (S, Mgh, K;) as also ↓ شَرُومٌ,
(S, K,) and ↓ شَرْمَآءُ; (K;) or the last of these in
this sense has not been heard, though mentioned
in the sense here following. (Mgh.) ―
-b2-  Also A
she-camel having her ثَفْر [here meaning the vulva,
or the orifice of the vagina,] cut [or rather slit
or rent]; and so ↓ شَرْمَآءُ, and ↓ مَشْرُومَةٌ: (M, TA:)
or ↓ شَرْمَآءُ applied to a she-camel and to a she-ass,
accord. to the Tekmileh, means having the vulva
slit, or rent: therefore the first-mentioned meaning of this epithet, applied to a woman, if correct,
may be tropical. (Mgh.) ―
-b3-  Also The فَرْج [or
vulva]; (K;) because of its being cleft. (TA.)
شَارِمٌ An arrow that slits, or rends, (يَشْرِمُ,) the

and having the upper lip slit; like أَعْلَمُ: and
having the ear slit; like أَخْرَبُ: and having the
eyelid slit; like أَشْتَرُ: it has all these meanings:
(IAar, TA:) fem. شَرْمَآءُ, applied to a woman.
(Msb.) ―
-b2-  For the fem., see also شَرِيمٌ, in three
places. ―
-b3-  The fem. is also applied to an ear
(أُذُنٌ), meaning Having a small portion cut from
the upper part; and so ↓ مُشَرَّمَةٌ. (TA.)

trad., where it is said, فَجَآءَهُ بِمُصْحَفٍ مُشَرَّمِ
الأَطْرَافِ [And he brought him a copy of the
Kur-án having the extremities slit, &c.]. (TA.)
―
