K, [in my MS. copy of the K شَأْفُ, and so
accord. to the TK, and in the CK without ء, but
I think that the right reading is شَأَفُ, and that its
verb is شَئِفَ, or it may be شَأْفُ, and inf. n. of
شُئِفَ,]) signifies The wound's becoming in a corrupt
state, so that it will hardly, or not at all, be

اِسْتَشْأَفَتْ, said of a قُرْصَة, [so in the TA, an
evident mistranscription, app. for قَرْحَة, and so in
the next paragraph, i. e. an ulcer, or imposthume,]
means صَارَ لَهَا أَصْلٌ [It had, or acquired, root, or
rootedness, or permanence; as though it became
a شَأْفَة]. (TA.)
شَئِفٌ [part. n. of شَئِفَ, and properly meaning
Having an ulcer, or imposthume, such as is termed
شَأْفَة,] is applied as an epithet to a heart, in the
following verse, cited by IKtt,
يَا أَيُّهَا الجَاهِلُ أَلَّا تَنْصَرِفْ
وَلَمْ تُدَاوِ قُرْصَةَ القَلْبِ الشَّئِفْ
[in which قُرْصَةَ is doubtless a mistranscription (like
that in the next preceding paragraph) for قَرْحَةَ;
the obvious meaning of the verse being, (assumed tropical:)  O thou
ignorant one, wherefore wilt not thou revert, when
thou hast not cured the sore of an ulcerated heart?].
(TA.)
?? An ulcer, or imposthume, (قَرْحَةٌ,) that
breaks out in the bottom of the foot, and is cauterized, (S, IAth, O, K,) or is cut, (Yaakoob,
IAth, O,) and goes away; (Yaakoob, S, IAth, O,
K;) and the word is also pronounced without ء
[i. e. شَافَةٌ]: (IAth, TA:) or an ulcer, or imposthume, in the foot of a person, who dies if it is
cut: (O, K:) and it is also said to be a tumour
in the hand, and foot, from the entering of a piece
of wood, or stick, into the flesh of the foot, or the
palm of the hand, and its remaining therein, so
that the place swells, and becomes large. (TA.)
اِسْتَأْصَلَ اللّٰهُ شَأْفَتَهُ (S, O, K) is a prov. (S, O)
meaning (assumed tropical:)  May God cause him to go away like as
the شأفة above mentioned goes away: (S, O, K:)
or this means may God extirpate him: for ―
-b2-
شَأْفَةٌ is also syn. with أَصْلٌ [i. e. Root, &c.]: (O,
K:) so says Sh. (O.) [See also 10 in art. اصل:
and see what here follows.] ―
-b3-  It is also said to
signify The family and household of a man: and
hence the form of imprecation, اِسْتَأْصَلَ اللّٰهُ شَأْفَتَهُمْ
[May God extirpate their family and household].
(TA.) ―
-b4-  And (tropical:)  Enmity. (TA.)
شَأَفَةٌ, thus with fet-h to the ء, is an epithet
applied to a man, meaning Mighty, potent, powerful, or strong; inaccessible, or difficult of access.
(TA.)
رِجْلٌ مَشْؤُوفَةٌ A foot affected with an ulcer, or
imposthume, such as is termed سَأْفَةٌ, breaking out
in it: (O, K:) from شُئِفَتْ رِجْلُهُ. (O, * K, * TA.)
―
-b2-  And مَشْؤُوفٌ, from شُئِفَ, Frightened, or
afraid; (A'Obeyd, O, K;) applied to a man.
(A'Obeyd, O.)

شُئِمَ عَلَيْهِمْ (S; MA, K,) inf. n. شُؤْمٌ, (MA,)
He (a man, S) was, or became, unlucky, or inauspicious, (صَارَ شُؤْمًا, S, K, in the MA شوم شد,)
to them: (S, MA, K;) as also شَأَمَهُمْ, and شَأَمَ
عليهم, and شَؤُمَ عليهم: (K:) or شَأَمَهُمْ, (AZ,
Ham p. 224,) or شَأَمَ عَلَيْهِمْ, (S,) or both of these,
(TA,) aor.
شَاَ^َ, (S, TA,) inf. n. شَأْمٌ, (TA,) he drew
upon them ill luck, or evil fortune; (S, TA;) or
caused ill luck, or evil fortune, to befall them
from him: (AZ, Ham ubi suprà, TA:) or شُؤُمٌ
as an inf. n. signifies the being unlucky: and the
rendering unlucky: and so شُومٌ [as it is commonly pronounced: see شُؤُمٌ below]. (KL.)
-A2-
And شَأَمَهُمْ, inf. n. شَأْمٌ, so in the L; in the K,
↓ شَأَّمَهُمْ, inf. n. تَشْئِيمٌ; but the former is the right;
(TA;) He made them to go, or journey, to الشَّأْم
[i. e. Syria]. (K, TA.)
2
شَاَّ^َ see what next precedes.
3
شَائِمْ بِأَصْحَابِكَ Take thou the direction of
the left hand with thy companions: (S, K, TA:)
يَامِنْ signifies “ take thou the direction of the
right hand. ” (TA.) ―
-b2-  And شَآمَ He (a man)
came to الشَّأْم [i. e. Syria]: like يَامَنَ signifying
“ he came to El-Yemen. ” (TA. [See also 4.])
4
اشأم He desired the left: like as أَيْمَنَ signifies “ he desired the right. ” (TA in art. يمن.)
―
-b2-  And He (a man, S) came to الشَّأْم [i. e. Syria]:
(S, K, TA: [see also 3:]) or he went thither:
and أَيْمَنَ signifies “ he came to El-Yemen. ”
(TA.)
-A2-  مَا أَشْأَمَهُ (S, K, TA) How unlucky, or
inauspicious, is he! (TA:) the vulgar say, مَا
أَيْشَمَهُ. (S, TA.)
5
تشأّم بِهِ, (MA, TA,) from الشُّؤْمُ, (TA,) He
found him, or it, unlucky, or inauspicious: and
he became unlucky by means of him, or it:
(MA:) or تشأّم signifies he had ill luck, or evil
fortune. (KL.) See also 6. ―
-b2-  And تشأّم He
took the direction of his left hand: (K, TA:)
and in like manner تَيَامَنَ, [whence it seems that
تشأّم in the sense expl. above may be a mistake
for ↓ تشآءم,] “ he took the direction of his right
hand. ” (TA.) ―
-b3-  And He asserted his relationship to [the people of] الشَّأْم [i. e. Syria]: (S, K:)
a verb similar to تكوّف and تقيّص. (S.)
6
تشآءموا بِهِ, (S, Msb, K, TA, &c.,) in some
of the copies of the K ↓ تشأّموا, (TA,) [and in
like manner تشأّم بِهِ, which is often opposed to
تَيَمَّنَ بِهِ, (see an instance in Bd xvii. 14,) is used
in the K in art. عطس, and تشأّم مِنْهُ in the TA
in the same art. as on the authority of IKh,
whence it seems that both these verbs are correct
in the sense here following, though the former is
probably preferable, and بِهِ ↓ استشأم is used in the
same manner in “ Les Oiseaux et les Fleurs,”
p. 83, as mentioned by Freytag, so that تشأّم به
and استشأم are the contr. of تيمّن به and استيمن,]
They augured evil from him, or it; regarded
him, or it, as an evil omen; (Msb, KL; *) like
تَطَيَّرُوا بِهِ: (Msb:) deemed him, or it, unlucky,
or inauspicious. (KL.) ―
-b2-  تشآءم, thus, with medd,
also signifies He took the direction of الشَّأْم[i. e.
Syria]. (TA.) ―
-b3-  See also 5.
10
إِسْتَشْاَ^َ see the next preceding paragraph.
الشَّأْمُ, the name of a certain country [i. e.
Syria], is masc. and fem.; (S;) sometimes masc.:
(K:) and may also be pronounced الشَّامُ [as it
commonly is in the present day]. (Msb.) ―
-b2-
[And as this country lies on the north of Arabia,
الشَّأْمُ also signifies The northern region; opposed
to اليَمَنُ.]
شُؤْمٌ, (S, Msb, K, &c.,) thus, with ء, but always
pronounced شُومٌ, without ء, (TA,) is an inf. n.:
(MA, KL: [see 1, first sentence, in two places:])
and signifies [as a simple subst.] Unluckiness, inauspiciousness, unfortunateness, unprosperousness,
evil fortune, or ill luck; contr. of يُمْنٌ; (S, K;)
[i. e.] i. q. َحْسٌ: (Har p. 158:) evil [of any
kind]; syn. شَرٌّ: (Msb:) [and particularly] an
evil omen: (PS:) and ↓ مَشْأَمَةٌ signifies the same
as شُؤْمٌ: (TA:) [or, like مَنْحَسَةٌ, a cause of unluckiness, &c.:] مَشَائِمُ is a pl. of شُؤْمٌ, [or of
↓ مَشْأَمَةٌ: if of the former,] irreg., like as its syn.
مَنَاحِسُ is [said to be] of نَحْسٌ. (TA in art.
نحس.) It is said in a trad., إِنْ كَانَ الشُّوْمُ فَفِى
ثَلَاث ٍ المَرْأَةِ وَالدَّارِ وَالفَرَسِ, meaning If there be
that whereof the consequence is disliked, or hated,
and feared, [or if there be unluckiness,] it is in
three things, the wife, and the house, and the
horse: i. e., if any of you have a wife whose
companionship he dislikes, or a house in which
he dislikes dwelling, or a horse that he dislikes
taking for the purpose of keeping post on the
enemies' frontier, let him separate himself therefrom, by divorcing the wife, and removing from
the house, and selling the horse: or, as some
say, the شؤم of the wife is her not producing
children; and that of the house, its straitness, and
the badness of its neighbour; and that of the
horse, one's not going to war upon it. (JM.)
―
-b2-  See also مَشْؤُومٌ.
-A2-  Also Black camels: and
حِضَارٌ signifies “ white ” camels, (K, TA,) and is
also written and pronounced حَضَارٌ: (TA:) neither
of these has a sing.: (K:) both occur in a verse
of Aboo-Dhu-eyb: but accord. to one reading
thereof it is شِيم; pl. of أَشْيَمُ: so says AA: and
IJ says that شُومٌ, [without ء,] being originally
شُيْمٌ, of the measure فُعْلٌ, may also be pl. of
أَشْيَمُ. (TA.)
شَأْمَةٌ and ↓ مَشْأَمَةٌ The left, meaning the left
side or direction or relative location or place;
(S, K;) i. q. [يَسْرَةٌ and] مَيْسَرَةٌ; (S;) contr. of
يَمْنَةٌ and مَيْمَنَةٌ. (K.) One says of a man, قَعَدَ
شأْمَةٌ [He sat on the left]. (S.) And one says,
خُذْ بِهِمْ شَأْمَةً i. e. [Take thou with them] the
direction of the left hand. (S.) And نَظَرْتُ يَمْنَةً
وَشَأْمَةً [I looked in a right direction and in a left
direction]. (TA.) And hence ↓ أَصْحَابُ المَشْأَمَةِ,
in the Kur [lvi. 9 and xc. 19], (TA,) meaning
[The occupants of the left: or] those who shall
have their records given to them in their left
hands: or the occupants of the low, or ignoble,
place, or station: or the havers of unfortunateness (الشُّؤْم): and أَصْحَابُ المَيْمَنَةِ is expl. as
having the contr. senses. (Ksh and Bd in lvi. 9.)
-A2-  Also, the former, A mole (خَالٌ) upon the
person: thus, with ء, as mentioned by IAth:
also mentioned without ء in art. شيم. (TA.) ―
-b2-
See also شَامَةٌ as meaning “ a black she-camel,”
in art. شيم.
شِئْمَةٌ Nature; natural, native, or innate, disposition, temper, or other quality or property:
(K, TA:) mentioned thus, as with ء, by AZ and
Lh, and said by IJ to be sometimes thus pronounced; but the pronunciation thereof with ء is
held by ISd to be extraordinary. (TA.) [See
art. شيم.]
شَامِىٌّ, (S, Msb, K, TA,) without ء, (TA,) and
↓ شَآم ٍ, (S, Msb, K,) of the measure فَعَال ٍ, (S,) an
allowable form, without ى, (Msb,) like تَهَام ٍ and
يَمَان ٍ, (TA,) and ↓ شَآمِىٌّ, (Sb, S, K,) [Syrian;]
of, or relating to, الشَّأْم: (S, Msb, K:) one
should not say شَأْم ٍ; any instance [of this] occurring by poetic license being accounted for as a
case of the use of the name of the country for the
rel. n.: (S:) the fem., applied to a woman, is
شَامِيَّةٌ and ↓ شَآمِيَةٌ, the latter without teshdeed:
(S, TA;) the pl. of شَامِىٌّ is شُوَامٌ, like غُرَابٌ [in
measure]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [And hence, Northern.]
شَآم ٍ, and شَآمِيَةٌ the fem. of the former; and
شَآمِىٌّ: see the next preceding paragraph.
شَائِمٌ: see مَشْؤُومٌ.
أَشْأَمُ [More, and most, unlucky, inauspicious,
unfortunate, or unprosperous]. The Arabs say,
أَشْأَمُ كُلِّ امْرِئ ٍ بَيْنَ لَحْيَيْهِ, (Meyd, TA,) as some
relate it, or, as others relate it, فَكَّيْهِ, which means
the same, (Meyd,) [app. meaning accord. to the
TA, The most unlucky thing of every man is
between his two jaws, or the two lateral portions
of his lower jaw; but it is said that] أَشْأَمُ is here
used in the sense of شُؤْمٌ [i. e. the unluckiness, &c.];
and in a similar manner [the contr.] أَيْمَنُ is used
[in the sense of يُمْن]: so says AHeyth: (Meyd:)
the prov. meaning the tongue. (AHeyth, TA.)
The fem. is شُؤْمَى. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Hence, (TA,) اليَدُ
الشُّؤْمَى The left hand or arm; contr. of اليُمْنَى;
(K, TA;) i. q. الشِّمَالُ. (TA.) It is said in a
trad., respecting camels, لَا يَأْتِى خَيْرُهَا إِلَّا مِنْ
جَانِبِهَا الأَشْأَمِ [Their goodness comes not save from
their left side]: i. e. they are milked and mounted
only from the left side. (TA.) ―
-b3-  See also مَشْؤُومٌ,
in three places. ―
-b4-  Zuheyr, in the following saying,
فَتُنْتَجْ لَكُمْ غِلْمَانَ أَشْأَمَ كُلُّهُمْ
كَأَحْمَرِ عَاد ٍ ثُمَّ تُرْضِعْ فَتَفْطِمْ
uses it in the sense of the inf. n. شُؤْم; (S;) meaning غِلْمَانَ شُؤْم ٍ: (S, and EM p. 124:) he says,
And it, i. e. war, will bring forth for you boys
of ill luck, or evil omen; all of them like Ahmar
of' Ád: then it will suckle these boys, and wean
them: by Ahmar of ' Ád, he means Ahmar of
Thamood, for Ahmar was the surname of him
who hamstrung the she-camel of Sálih, and his
name was Kudár: he says thus for the sake of
the measure: or, as some say, Thamood were
called 'Ád-el-Ákhireh. (EM.)
مَشْأَمَةٌ: see شُؤْمٌ, in two places: ―
-b2-  and see also
شَأْمَةٌ, likewise in two places.
مَشْؤُومٌ, (S, MA, K, KL,) and مَشُومٌ, (S, K,)
the latter like مَقُولٌ, (TA,) [a contraction of the
former,] Unlucky, or inauspicious, (S, MA, K,
KL,) عَى قَوْمِهِ [to his people, or party], (S,
MA, K,) and عَلَى نَفْسِهِ [to himself]: (Ksh and
Bd in lvi. 9:) [and so ↓ شُؤْمٌ; (as in an ex. in
the first sentence of this art.;) this being an epithet as well as a subst., like its syn. نَحْسٌ; syn.
with مَشْؤُومٌ, like as نَحْسٌ is syn. with مَنْحُوسٌ;
and app., like نَحْسٌ, used alike as sing. and pl.,
for it seems to be originally an inf. n.:] and so
↓ شَائِمٌ; (K;) or this signifies drawing ill luck,
or evil fortune, upon his people [and upon himself]: (S, TA:) and أَشَائِمُ, a pl., likewise signifies unlucky, or inauspicious; (KL;) contr. of
أَيَامِنُ; (S, K, TA;) these being pls. of ↓ أَشْأَمُ
and أَيْمَنُ: (TA:) the pl. of مَشْؤُومٌ is مَشَائِيمُ, (S,
KL, TA,) which is extr., for by rule it should be
مَشْؤُومُونَ. (TA.) One says also ↓ طَائِرٌ أَشْأَمُ
meaning [An omen] happening, or occurring,
(جَار ٍ,) with unluckiness, or inauspiciousness; [i. e.
an unlucky, or inauspicious, omen;] (K, TA;)
and [in like manner] ↓ طَيْرٌ أَشْأَمُ: and the pl. is
أَشَائِمُ [as above]. (TA.)
