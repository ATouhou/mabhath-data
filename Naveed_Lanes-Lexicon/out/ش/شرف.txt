are pls. of pauc., or, as some say, شرفات [i. e.
شُرُفَاتٌ] is pl. of ↓ شُرُفَةٌ, with two dammehs: EshShiháb says that شُرْفَات is expl. as meaning the
highest portions of a قَصْر; but what are thus
termed are only what are built on the top of a
wall, distinct from one another, [side by side, like
merlons of a parapet,] according to a well-known

noble, to-day], and عَنْ قَلِيلٍ ↓ شَارِفٌ as meaning
one who will be شَرِيف [after a little while]: (Fr,
S, K:) the pl. [of pauc.] is أَشْرَافٌ and [of mult.]
شُرَفَآءُ (S, O, Msb, K) and ↓ شَرَفٌ, so in the K, app.
denoting that this last is one of the pls. of شريف,
and it is said in the O that شَرَفٌ is syn. with
شُرَفَآءُ; but in the L it is said that it is syn. with
شَرِيفٌ; and hence the saying هُوَ شَرَفُ قَوْمِهِ
meaning He is the شَرِيف of his people, and
كَرَمُهُمْ meaning the كَرِيم of them; and thus it
has been expl. as used in a trad.: (TA:) [but

used as an epithet, and therefore applicable to a
single person and to a pl. number, and also to two
persons, and likewise to a female as well as to a
male.] ―

Sultán.]

pls. of بَازِلٌ and عَائِذٌ, (S, O,) or شُرُفٌ, like كُتُبٌ,

the former is a contraction of the latter, (IAth,
TA,) and شَوَارِفُ [also pl. of شَارِفَةٌ] (O, K) and

applied to the he-camel; but it is so applied, as
well as to the she-camel, accord. to the Towsheeh
of El-Jelál. (TA.) Hence, as being likened to
black decrepit she-camels, (Aboo-Bekr, TA,)
الشُّرُفُ الجُونُ, with two dammehs, [which I think
a mistake, unless it mean with a dammeh to each
word,] (K,) or الشَّرْفُ الجُونُ, (O, IAth, TA,)
occurring in a trad., meaning (assumed tropical:)  [Trials, or conflicts and factions,] like portions of the dark
night: (O, * K, * TA:) thus expl. by the Prophet:

[so in the O, and in one of my copies of the S:
in my other copy of the S, and in the K, جَبَلٌ,
i. e. the name of a certain mountain:] a postclassical word. (S, O.) ―
-b2-  And شَارُوفٌ also signifies A broom: (S, O, K:) a Pers. word, (S,)
arabicized, from جَارُوبٌ, (O, K,) originally جَاىْ
رُوبْ, which means “ a place-sweeper. ” (O.)
أَشْرَفُ [More, and most, high, elevated, exalted,
or eminent, in rank, condition, or estimation;
&c.; generally meaning more, and most, high-born
or noble; (see شَرِيفٌ;)] surpassing in شَرَف. (S,
O.) ―
-b2-  مَنْكِبٌ أَشْرَفُ A high shoulder; (S, O, K;)
such as has a goodly rising; which implies what
is termed إِهْدَآء [inf. n. of أَهْدَأَهُ, and here app.
meaning the “ being curved in the back ”]. (TA.)
And أُذُنٌ شَرْفَآءُ A long ear; (S, O, K;) standing
up; rising above what is next to it: and so اذن
↓ شُرَافِيَّةٌ. (TA.) ―
-b3-  See also شُرَافِىٌّ [أَشْرَفُ also
signifies Having a prominent, or an apparent,
ear: opposed to أَسَكُّ, q. v. ―
-b4-  Hence,] الأَشْرَفُ is
an appellation of The bat; (O, K, TA;) because
its ears are prominent and apparent: it is bare of
downy and other feathers, and is viviparous, not
oviparous: so in the saying of Bishr Ibn-ElMoatemir,
وَطَائِرٌ لَيْسَ لَهُ وَكْرُ وَطَائِرٌ أَشْرَفُ ذُو جُرْدَةٍ
[And a flying thing that has prominent and apparent ears and a denuded body, and a flying thing
that has no nest]: (O, TA:) in the K is added,
and another bird, that has no nest, &c.: but this
is taken from an explanation of the latter hemistich of the verse cited above; which explanation
is as follows: (TA:) the bird that has no nest is
one of which the Bahránees [so in the TA, but
accord. to the O “ the sailors,”] tell that it does
not alight save while it makes, of the dust, or
earth, a place in which it lays its eggs, and which
it covers over; then it flies into the air, and its
eggs break open of themselves at the expiration
of the term thereof; and when its young ones are
able to fly, they do after the habit of their parents.
(O, L, TA: and the same is said, less fully, in the
K.) ―
-b5-  مَدِينَةٌ شَرْفَآءُ A city having شُرَف, (Mgh,
O, K, *) pl. of شُرْفَةٌ [q. v.]: (O:) the pl. of أَشْرَفُ
and of شَرْفَآءُ, accord. to rule, is شُرْفٌ. (Mgh. [In
the copies of the K, الشُّرُفُ is erroneously said to
be pl. of الشَّرْفَآءُ.]) It is said in a trad. of Ibn-
' Abbás, أُمِرْنَا أَنْ نَبْنِىَ المَدَائِنَ شُرْفًا وَالمَسَاجِدَ جُمًّا
i. e. We have been commanded to build cities
with شُرَف and mosques without شُرَف. (Mgh, O. *)
أَشْرَافٌ The ears and nose of a man: (O, K,
TA:) its sing. in this sense is not mentioned: it
is app. ↓ شَرَفٌ; like سَبَبٌ, sing. of أَسْبَابٌ. (TA.)
تَشْرِيفٌ inf. n. of 2 [q. v.]. (S &c.) ―
-b2-  [And
also a post-classical term applied to An honorary
present, such as a garment &c.: and a letter, i. e.
an epistle, considered as conferring honour: pl.
تَشْرِيفَاتٌ.]
مَشْرَفٌ: see شَرَفٌ, in the middle of the paragraph: and see also what here next follows.
مُشْرَفٌ, (O, K,) like مُكْرَمٌ, (K,) or ↓ مَشْرَفٌ
[q. v. voce شَرَفٌ], (so in my two copies of the S,)
A place from which one overlooks, i. e. looks upon,
or views, [a thing] from above. (S, O, K.) ―
-b2-
Hence the saying in a trad., مَا جَآءَكَ مِنْ هٰذَا
المَالِ وَأَنْتَ غَيْرُ مُشْرَفٍ وَلَا سَائِلٍ فَخْذْهُ (O, TA)
i. e. [What comes to thee of this property] thou
not coveting nor looking for it [nor asking it,
take it]. (O.)
مُشْرِفٌ [part. n. of 4;] High; (S, Mgh, Msb;)
[or overtopping; &c.;] applied to a mountain,
(S,) or a place. (Mgh, Msb.)
سُيُوفٌ مَشْرَفِيَّةٌ Certain swords, (S, O, K,) so
called in relation to مَشَارِفُ, (S,) or in relation to
مَشَارِفُ الشَّامِ, (O, Msb, K,) i. e. certain towns, or
villages, of the land of the Arabs, near to the
رِيف [q. v.]: (S, O, Msb, K:) so says AO: (S,
O:) or, as some say, this is a mistake, and they
are so called in relation to a place of El-Yemen:
(Msb:) [or, accord. to some, in relation to المَشَارِفُ,
certain towns, or villages, near Howrán: (see
De Sacy's Chrest. Ar., sec. ed., iii. 53:)] and it is
said that مَشْرَف was the name of a blacksmith
who made swords: (TA:) one says سَيْفٌ مَشْرَفِىٌّ,
(S, O, Msb,) not مَشَارِفِىٌّ, because a rel. n. is not
formed from a pl. of the measure of مَشَارِفُ.
(S, O.)
مُشَرَّفٌ [Elevated, or exalted, in rank, condition,
or estimation; or ennobled]; (K, TA;) an epithet
applied to a man; from الشَّرَفُ. (TA.)
-A2-  Also A
garment, or piece of cloth, dyed with the red clay
or earth [&c.] called شَرَف. (IAar, TA.)
مَشْرُوفٌ (S, TA) and مَشْرُوفٌ عَلَيْهِ (Z, TA) Overcome, or surpassed, in شَرَف [i. e. highness, elevation, or eminence, of rank, condition, or estimation; or nobility]. (S, Z, TA.)
مُشْتَرِفٌ A horse high in make. (S, O, K.)
