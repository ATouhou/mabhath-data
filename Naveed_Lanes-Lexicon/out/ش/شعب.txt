شَعَبَ, (S, Msb,) aor.
شَعَبَ, (Msb,) inf. n. شَعْبٌ,
(A, Msb, K,) He collected; brought, gathered, or
drew, together; or united; (S, A, Msb, K;) a
thing, (S,) any thing or things, and a people or
party: (Msb:) and he separated; put apart, or
asunder; divided; disunited; or dispersed or
scattered; (S, A, Msb, K;) a thing, (S,) any
thing or things, and a people or party: (Msb:)
thus having two contr. significations: (S:) so
expressly state A'Obeyd and Aboo-Ziyád: (TA:)
but accord. to IDrd, it has not two contr. significations [in one and the same dial.]: he says that
the two meanings are peculiar to the dials. of two
peoples, (Msb, TA, *) each meaning belonging to
the dial. of one people exclusively. (TA.)
[Hence, as it seems to be indicated in the S and
A, or from شَعْبٌ meaning “ a tribe,” as it seems
to be indicated in the Ham p. 538,] one says,
تَفَرَّقَ شَعْبُهُمْ, (S,) or شَتَّ شَعْبُهُمْ, (A, Ham,)
(tropical:)  [Their union became dissolved, or broken up; or
their tribe became separated;] meaning they
became separated after being congregated: (S,
Ham:) and اِلْتَأَمَ شَعْبُهُمْ (S, A, Ham) (tropical:)  [Their
separation became closed up, or their tribe drew
together;] meaning they drew together after being
separated. (S, Ham.) And شَعَبَتْهُمُ المَنِيَّةُ Death
separated them: (S:) and شَعَبَتْهُ شَعُوبُ [Death
separated him from his companions]; (TA;)
said of a man when he has died. (O in art. عبل:
in the K, in that art., ↓ اِشْتَعَبَتْهُ [perhaps a mistranscription].) And it is said in a trad., مَا هٰذِهِ
الفُتْيَا الَّتِى شَعَبْتَ بِهَا النَّاسَ i. e, [What is this
judicial decision] with which thou hast divided
the people? (S. [In the TA, on the authority of
IAth, التى شَغَبَتْ فِى النَّاسِ, which means,
“ which has excited evil among the people. ”])
One says also, شَعَبَ الرَّجُلُ أَمْرَهُ (assumed tropical:)  The man broke
up, discomposed, deranged, or disorganized, [or
rendered unsound, impaired, or marred, (agreeably with another explanation of the verb in what
follows,)] his state of affairs: (As, A'Obeyd,
TA:) whence the saying of 'Alee Ibn-El-'Adheer
El-Ghanawee,
وَإِذَا رَأَيْتَ المَرْءَ يَشْعَبُ أَمْرَهُ
شَعْبَ العَصَا وَيَلَجُّ فِى العِصْيَانِ
(assumed tropical:)  [And when thou seest the man break up his
state of affairs as with the breaking up of the
staff, and persevere in disobedience, or rebellion].
(A'Obeyd, TA.) ―
-b2-  Also, aor, as above, (Msb,)
and so the inf. n., (S, A, Msb, K,) He repaired
a cracked thing [such as a wooden bowl or some
other vessel, by closing up its crack or cracks, or
by piecing it: see 2, which has a similar signification, but implying muchness]: (S, Msb:) and
[in a general sense,] he repaired, mended,
amended, adjusted, or put into a right, or proper,
state: (A, K, TA:) and it signifies the contr.
also [of the former meaning and] of this, in the
same, or in another, dial.: (TA:) [i. e.] he cracked
a thing [such as a wooden bowl &c.]: (A, Msb:)
and he corrupted, rendered unsound, impaired, or
marred. (A, K, TA.) شَعْبٌ صَغِيرٌ مِنْ شَعْبٍ كَبِيرٍ,
occurring in a trad. of 'Omar, means A little
repairing, of, or amid, much impairing. (TA.)
―
-b3-  [He gave a portion of property; as though he
broke it off.] One says, اِشْعَبْ لِى شُعْبَةً مِنَ المَالِ
Give thou to me a portion of the property. (TA.)
―
-b4-  He (the commander, or prince, S) sent a messenger (S, K) إِلَيْهِ [to him], (K,) or إِلَى مَوْضِعِ كَذَا
[to such a place]. (S.) ―
-b5-  He turned, or sent,
him, or it, away, or back: (K, TA:) aor. and
inf.n. as above. (TA.) And شَعَبَ اللِّجَامُ الفَرَسَ
The bridle turned away or back, or withheld, or
restrained, the horse from the direction towards
which he was going. (K.) ―
-b6-  He, or it, diverted
a man by occupying him, busying him, or engaging his attention. (K, TA.) One says, مَا
شَعَبَكَ عَنِّى [What diverted thee, or what has
diverted thee, &c., from me?]. (TA.)
-A2-  It is
also intrans.: see 4. ―
-b2-  [Thus it signifies He
quitted his companions, desiring others.] One
says, شَعَبَ إِلَيْهِمْ (K, TA) فِى عَدَدِ كَذَا (TA) He
yearned towards them [with such a number of
men], and quitted his companions. (K, TA.) ―
-b3-
And He, or it, appeared [distinct from others]:
(K, TA:) whence the month [شَعْبَان, q. v.,] is
[said to be] named. (TA.)
-A3-  Also, (K, TA,)
aor. and inf. n. as above, (TA,) said of a camel,
He cropped (اِهْتَضَمَ) the upper, or uppermost,
parts of trees [or shrubs]. (K, TA.)
-A4-  شَعِبَ,
aor.
شَعَبَ, (K,) inf. n. شَعَبٌ, (S, * K, * TA,) He (a
goat, S, TA, and a gazelle, TA) was wide, (K,)
or very wide, (S,) between the horns, (S, K,) and
between the shoulders. (K, * TA.) [See also
شَعَبٌ, below.]
2
شعّب [app. signifies He collected several
things; or he collected much: and] he separated
several things; or he separated much. (O.) ―
-b2-
Also He repaired a cracked wooden bowl [or
some other vessel] in several places [by closing up
its cracks, or by piecing it]: (S, O:) [and app.,
in a general sense, he repaired, mended, amended,
adjusted, or put into a right, or proper, state,
several things; or he repaired, &c., much: and it
seems to signify also the contr. of these two
meanings: i. e. he cracked several things; or he
cracked in several places: and he corrupted,
rendered unsound, impaired, or marred, several
things; or he corrupted, &c., much.]
-A2-  It is also
intrans.: see 4. ―
-b2-  Thus, said of seed-produce, It
branched forth, or forked, after being in leaf, or
blade; (TA;) like ↓ تشعّب. (K, * TA.) [Hence,]
one says, إِنِّى أَرَى الشَّرَّ شَعَّبَ (assumed tropical:)  [Verily I see
the evil to have grown like seed-produce when it
branches forth]; like as one says, قَصَّبَ, and نَبَّبَ.
(TA in art. نب.)
3
شاعبهُ He became distant, or remote, from
him; (K, TA;) namely, his companion. (TA.)
[Hence,] شاعب الحَيَاةَ (assumed tropical:)  [He quitted life]. (TA.)
And شَاعَبَتْ نَفْسُهُ (K, TA) His soul [departed,
or] quitted life; (TA;) meaning he died; (K,
TA;) as also ↓ انشعب [i. e. انشعب هُوَ]. (K.)
[See also what next follows.]
4
اشعب He died: (S, K: [see also 3:]) or (so
in the S and TA, but in the K “ and ”) he separated himself from another or others, never to
return; (S, K;) as also ↓ شعّب or ↓ شَعَبَ, accord.
to different copies of the K, the latter as in the L.
(TA.) A poet says, (S,) namely, En-Nábighah
El-Jaadee, (IB, TA.)
وَكَانُوا أُنَاسًا مِنْ شُعُوبٍ فَأَشْعَبُوا
(S, IB, TA,) or وَكَانُوا شُعُوبًا مِنْ أُنَاسٍ, accord.
to different readings: [app. meaning, And they
were men of divided races or tribes, or were
divided races or tribes of men; so they perished;
or separated, never to return:] IB says, after
mentioning the former reading, i. e. they were of
men who should perish; so they perished: having
previously mentioned the latter reading, and
added, i. e. they were of those whom شعوب
should overtake. (TA. [IB's explanations seem
at first sight to indicate that he read شَعُوبَ and
شَعُوبًا; neither of which is admissible: each of
his explanations app. relates to both readings; as
though he understood the poet to mean, they
were men separated from different tribes, to be
overtaken by others; so they perished.])
5
تشعّب and ↓ انشعب are quasi-pass. verbs,
the former of شَعَّبَ and the latter of شَعَبَ: (TA:)
[the former, therefore, is most correctly to be
regarded and used as intensive in its significations,
or as relating to several things or persons: but it
is said that] both signify alike: [app. It became
collected; it became brought, gathered, or drawn,
together; or it became united: and also] it became
separated, put apart or asunder, divided, disunited, or dispersed or scattered: (S, K:) and
it, or he, became distant, or remote. (K.) One
says, تَشَعَّبُوا فِى طَلَبِ المِيَاهِ [They became separated, &c., or they separated themselves, &c., in
search of the waters], and فِى الغَارَاتِ [in predatory excursions]. (TA.) And عَنِّى ↓ انشعب
فُلَانٌ Such a one became distant, or remote, from
me; or withdrew to a distance, or for away, from
me. (TA.) And الطَّرِيقُ ↓ انشعب [and تشعّب]
The road separated. (S, A, Msb.) And ↓ انشعب
النَّهْرُ and تشعّب The river separated [or branched
forth] into other rivers. (TA.) And ↓ انشعبت
أَغْصَانُ الشَّجَرَةِ (S, Msb, TA) and تشعّبت (TA)
The branches of the tree separated, divided,
straggled, or spread out dispersedly; (S, TA;) or
branched forth from the stem, and separated,
divided, &c. (Msb.) See also 2. One says also,
تشعّب أَمْرُ الرَّجُلِ (assumed tropical:)  [The state of affairs of the
man became broken up, discomposed, deranged,
disorganized, or (agreeably with another explanation of the verb in what follows) rendered unsound, impaired, or marred]. (A.) ―
-b2-  Also ↓ the
latter verb, [or each,] It became closed up; [or
repaired by having a crack or cracks closed up,
or by being pieced;] said of a cracked thing:
(TA:) and ↓ both verbs, i. q. اِنْصَلَحَ [which
means, in a general sense, it became rectified,
repaired, mended, amended, adjusted, or put into
a right, or proper, state; &c.; but I have not
found this verb (انصلح) in its proper art. in any
of the Lexicons]: (K, TA:) and ↓ the latter signifies also it became cracked; (A;) [and in like
manner the former, said of a number of things;
or it became cracked in several places when said
of a single thing: and hence ↓ both signify, in a
general sense, it became corrupted, rendered unsound, impaired, or marred; a meaning which
may justly be assigned to the former verb in the
phrase mentioned in the next preceding sentence.]

إِشْتَعَبَ see 1, in the former half of the paragraph.
شَعْبٌ inf. n. of شَعَبَ [q. v.]. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  [Used
as a simple subst., it signifies Collection, or
union: and also separation, division, or disunion;
and] a state of separation or division or disunion;
(K, TA;) as also ↓ شُعْبَةٌ: (S, TA:) pl. of the
former شُعُوبٌ. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And [hence, perhaps,
as implying both union and division,] Such as is
divided [into sub-tribes], of the tribes of the
Arabs and foreigners: (S: [in my copy of the
Msb, ما انقسمت فيه قبائل العرب, as though
it meant the tribes of the Arabs collectively,
agreeably with another explanation to be mentioned below; but I think that there may be a
mistranscription in this case:]) pl. شُعُوبٌ: (S,
Msb:) or it signifies, as some say, (Msb,) or
signifies also, (S,) a great tribe; syn. قَبِيلَةٌ عَظِيمَةٌ,
(S, A, K,) or حَىٌّ عَظِيمٌ; (Msb;) the parent of
the [tribes called] قَبَائِل, to which they refer their
origin, and which comprises them: (S:) or, as
some say, a great tribe (حَىٌّ عَظِيمٌ) forming a
branch of a قَبِيلَة: or a قَبِيلَة itself: (TA:)
A' Obeyd says, on the authority of Ibn-El-Kelbee,
on the authority of his father, that the شَعْب is
greater than the قَبِيلَة; next to which is the فَصِيلَة;
then, the عَمَارَة; then, the بَطْن; then, the فَخِذ:
(S, TA:) but IB says that the true order is that
which Ez-Zubeyr Ibn-Bekkár has stated, and is
as follows: (TA:) [i. e.] the genealogies of the
Arabs consist of six degrees; (Msb;) first, the
شَعْب; then, the قَبِيلَة; then, the عَمَارَة, (Msb,
TA,) with fet-h and with kesr, to the ع; (Msb;)
then, the بَطْن; then, the فَخِذ; and then, the
فَصيلَة: thus, Khuzeymeh is a شعب; and Kináneh,
a قبيلَة; and Kureysh, an عمارة; and Kuseí, a
بطن; and Háshim, a فخذ; and El-'Abbás, a
فصيلة: (Msb, TA:) and Aboo-Usámeh says that
these classes are agreeable with the order obtaining in the structure of man; the شعب is the
greatest of them, derived from the شَعْب [or
suture] of the head; next is the قبيلة, from the
قبيلة [which is a term applied to any one of the
four principal bones] of the head; then, the عمارة,
which is the breast; then, the بطن [or belly];
then, the فخذ [or thigh]; and then, the فصيلة,
which is the shank: to these some add the عَشِتيرَة,
which consists of few in comparison with what
are before mentioned: (TA:) and some add after
this the رَهْط: some also add the جِذْم before the
شعب: (TA in art. بطن:) the pl. is as above.
(TA.) It signifies also A nation, people, race, or
family of mankind; syn. جِيلٌ; as expl. by IM
and others: in the K, [and in a copy of the A,]
erroneously, جَبَل [a mountain]: (TA:) but it is
[strangely] said by Aboo-'Obeyd El-Bekree that
accord. to all except Bundár, the word in this
sense is ↓ شِعْبٌ, with kesr. (MF.) And the pl.,
شُعُوبٌ, is [said to be] especially applied to denote
the foreigners (العَجَم): (TA:) [thus it is said
that] the phrase, in a trad., إِنَّ رَجُلًا مِنَ الشُّعُوبِ
أَسْلَمَ means [Verily a man] of the foreigners
(العَجَم) [became a Muslim: but see الشُّعُوبِيَّةُ].
(S.) ―
-b4-  Also, [as implying separation,] Distance,
or remoteness. (A, K.) So in the phrase شَعْبُ
الدَّارِ [The distance, or remoteness, of the abode, or
dwelling]. (TA.) ―
-b5-  And A crack (S, A, K,
TA) in a thing, (S,) which the شَعَّاب repairs.
(S, * TA.) ―
-b6-  And The place of junction [i. e. the
suture] of the قَبَائِل [or principal bones] of the
head; (K;) the شَأْن which conjoins the قبائل of
the head: the قبائل in the head being [the frontal
bone, the occipital bone, and the two parietal
bones; in all,] four in number. (S.) ―
-b7-  [Hence,
perhaps,] هُمَا شَعْبَانِ (assumed tropical:)  They two are likes [or like
each other]. (S.) ―
-b8-  See also شِعْبٌ.
-A2-  Also
Distant, or remote; (K;) as in the phrase مَآءٌ
شَعْبٌ [Distant, or remote, water]: pl. شُعُوبٌ.

(S, A, O, L, Msb, K:) primarily a road in a
mountain (Har p. 29) and in valleys: (Id. p. 72:)
afterwards applied to any road: (Id. p. 29:) [see
also مَشْعَبٌ:] pl. شِعَابٌ. (S, O, Msb.) And A
water-course, or place in which water flows, in [a
low, or depressed, tract, such as is called] a بَطْن
of land, (ISh, A, O, K,) having two elevated
borders, and in width equal to the stature of a
man lying down, and sometimes between the two
faces, or acclivities, of two mountains. (ISh, O.)

ravine, or gap, [or pass,] between two mountains.
(A, K.) ―
-b2-  Also [A reef of rocks in the sea: so
in the present day: or] a زِرْبَة or زَرَبَة (accord. to
different copies of the K in art. جهن [but neither
of these two words do I find in their proper art.
in any Lex.]) in the sea, such as is connected with
the shore: if not connected with the shore, a bowshot distant, it is called جُهْنٌ. (K and TA in art.
جهن.) ―
-b3-  And A brand, or mark made with a
hot iron, (S, K,) upon camels, (K,) peculiar to
the Benoo-Minkar, in form resembling the
[hooked stick called] مِحْجَن: (S:) or a brand
upon the thigh, lengthwise, [consisting of] two
lines meeting at the top and separated at the
bottom: (ISh, TA:) or a brand united [at the
upper part and] at the lower part separated:
(Aboo-' Alee in the “ Tedhkireh,” TA: [but there
is an omission here, so that the reverse may
perhaps be meant:]) or a brand upon the neck,
like the مِحْجَن: (Suh in the R, TA:) in a marginal note in the copy of the L, it is said that
شعب signifying a brand is with kesr to the ش
and with fet-h [i. e. شِعْبٌ and ↓ شَعْبٌ]. (TA.) ―
-b4-
See also شَعْبٌ. ―
-b5-  [And see the pl. شِعَابٌ below.]

and شِعَابٌ, as above. (TA.) And شُعَبُ الغُصْنِ

(TA.) And [hence] عَصًا فِى رَأْسِهَا شُعْبَتَانِ [A
staff having at his head two forking portions or
projections]; (A, TA;) and Az mentions, as
heard by him from the Arabs, ↓ شُعْبَانِ, without

one thing, or state of things, would not be divided
into many things, or states: [i. e. Nor did I think
that the vicissitudes of fortune would divide one
whole body of men into many parties:] but Az
disapproves of this explanation, and says that
شُعَب here means Intentions, designs, or purposes:
he says that the poet describes tribes assembled
together in the [season called] رَبِيع, who, when
they desired to return to the watering-places,
differed in their intentions, or designs; wherefore
he says, Nor did I think that various intentions
would divide [one whole body of men who before
had] a consentient intention. (L, TA.) ―

(Msb, K:) so called from تَشَعَّبَ “ it became
separated; ” (K, TA;) because therein they used
to separate, or disperse themselves, in search of
water [when the months were regulated by the
solar year; this month then corresponding partly
to June and partly to July, as shown voce زَمَنٌ,
q. v.]; or, as some say, for predatory expeditions
[after having been restrained therefrom during
the sacred month of Rejeb]; or, accord. to some,
as Th says, from شَعَبَ “ it appeared; ” because of
its appearance between the months of Rejeb and
Ramadán. (TA.) ―
-b2-  غَزَالُ شَعْبَانَ A certain insect, (K, * TA,) a species of the جُنْدَب, or of the

شِعَابٌ pl. of شِعْبٌ: (S, O, Msb:) and of شُعْبَةٌ.
(K, TA.) ―
-b2-  شَغَلَتْ شِعَابِى جَدْوَاىَ is a prov.,
[expl. as] meaning The abundance of the food
[that I have to procure for my family] has occupied me so as to divert me from giving to people:
(S, TA:) [Z considers شعاب, here, as pl. of شُعْبَةٌ
“ a branch,” and as meaning duties, and relations:
(Freytag's Arab. Prov., i. 653:)] but El-Mundhiree says that شِعَابِى is a mistranscription: the
other reading is سَعَاتِى, meaning “ my expending
upon my family. ” (Meyd. [See also سَعَاةٌ, in
art. سعو and سعى.])
شَعُوبُ, (S, A, Msb, K,) without the article ال,
and imperfectly decl., (Msb,) and الشَّعُوبُ, (A,
Msb, K,) with the article, and perfectly decl.,
(Msb,) but several authors disallow this latter,
accounting it wrong; (TA;) a name for Death;
(S, A, * Msb, K; *) so called because it separates
men: (S, Msb:) the former is a proper name:
(Msb:) J says [in the S] that it is determinate,
and does not admit the article ال: in the L, it is
said that شَعُوبُ and الشَّعُوبُ both signify as above;
and that in either case it may be originally an
epithet, being like the epithets قَتُول and ضَرُوب;
and if so, the article in this case is as in العَبَّاسُ
and الحَسَنُ and الحٰرِثُ: and this opinion is confirmed by what is said of its derivation: but he
who says شَعُوب, without the article, makes the
word a pure substantive, and deprives it literally
of the character of an epithet; wherefore the
article is not necessarily attached to it, as it is not
to عَبَّاس and حٰرِث; yet the essence of an epithet
is in it still, as in the instance of جَابِرُ بْنُ حَبَّةَ, a
name for “ bread,” so called because it reinvigorates the hungry; and as in وَاسِط, [a certain
town] so called, accord. to Sb, because midway
between El-'Irák [' Irák el-'Ajam] and El-Basrah:
thus in the L. (TA.) One says of a person when
he has been at the point of death and then escaped,
أَقَصَّتْهُ شَعُوبُ [Death became near to him]. (TA.)
And it is said in a trad., فَمَا زِلْتُ وَاضِعًا رِجْلِى
عَلَى خَدِّهِ حَتَّى أَزَرْتُهُ شَعُوبَ, i. e. [And I ceased
not putting my foot upon his cheek until] I made
death to visit him. (TA.)
شَعِيبٌ A [leathern water-bag such as is called]
