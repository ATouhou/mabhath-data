(TA.)
Q. Q. 2
تَشَيْطَنَ: see what next precedes.
شَطَنٌ A rope, (S, Msb, K,) in a general sense:
(K:) or a long rope: (Kh, S, K:) or a long and
strongly-twisted rope by means of which one
draws water: (TA:) pl. أَشْطَانٌ. (S, Msb, K.)
Mention is made, in a trad., of a horse as being
مَرْبُوطٌ بِشَطَنَيْنِ [i. e. Tied with two ropes, or long
ropes, &c.,] because of his strength. (TA.) And
one says of a strong-spirited horse, إِنَّهُ لَيَنْزُو بَيْنَ
شَطَنَيْنِ [Verily he leaps between two ropes, or
long ropes, &c.]: a saying applied as a prov. to
him who exults, or exults greatly, or excessively,
and behaves insolently and ungratefully, and is
strong. (TA.) An Arab of the desert described
a horse (S, Msb) that did not become abraded in
the sole of his hoof (so in a copy of the S) by
saying, كَأَنَّهُ شَيْطَانٌ فِى أَشْطَانٍ [As though he
were a devil in ropes, or long ropes, &c.]. (S,
Msb.)
نَوًى شَطُونٌ (S) or نِيَّةٌ شَطُونٌ (K) [A place to
which one purposes journeying] that is distant, or
remote. (S, K.) And غَزْوَةٌ شَطُونٌ [A warring
and plundering expedition] that is distant. (K.)
And حَرْبٌ شَطُونٌ [Distant war: or] (assumed tropical:)  war that
is difficult [because distant]. (TA. See an ex. in
a verse cited voce جُبَّةٌ.) [See also شَطِينٌ, and
شَاطِنٌ.] ―
-b2-  بِئْرٌ شَطُونٌ (tropical:)  A deep well, (S, K, TA,)
curving in its interior: (TA:) or a well from
which the bucket is drawn out by means of two
ropes, from its two sides, wide in the upper part
and narrow in the lower part; (K, TA;) so that
if one draws out the bucket from it by means of
one rope, one draws it against the casing, and it
becomes rent. (TA.) And رُمْحٌ شَطُونٌ (assumed tropical:)  A long
and crooked spear. (TA.)
شَطِينٌ Distant, or remote. (TA. [See also
شَطُونٌ, and شَاطِنٌ.])
شَاطِنٌ [Distant, or remote, in respect of the
place of alighting or abode]; i. q. شَاطِبٌ [q. v.].
(TA in art. شطب. [See also شَطُونٌ, and شَطِينٌ.])
―
-b2-  And (assumed tropical:)  Far from the truth [and from the
mercy of God: see 1]. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And i. q.
خَبِيثٌ (assumed tropical:)  [Bad, corrupt, &c.; like سَاطِنٌ]. (K.)
Umeiyeh (S, TA) Ibn-Abi-s-Salt, referring to
Solomon, (TA,) says,
أَيُّمَا شَاطِنٍ عَصَاهُ عَكَاهُ
ثُمَّ يُلْقَى فِى السِّجْنِ وَالأَغْلَالِ
[Whatever bad one disobeyed him, he bound him
in irons; then he was cast into the prison and the
shackles for the neck and hands]. (S, TA.)
شَيْطَانٌ a word of well-known meaning [i. e. A
devil; and with the article ال, the devil, Satan]:
(S, K:) any that is excessively, or inordinately,
proud or corrupt or unbelieving or rebellious, or
that is insolent and audacious in pride and in
acts of rebellion, of mankind, and of the jinn, or
genii, and of beasts; (A'Obeyd, S, Msb, K;) as
is shown in relation to the first and second of
these by what is said in the Kur vi. 112, and ii.
13 and 96: (TA:) the ن is radical, (S, Msb,
TA,) the word being of the measure فَيْعَالٌ, from
شَطَنَ, (Msb, TA,) signifying “ he was, or became,
distant, or remote,” (TA,) or signifying “ he was,
or became, remote, or far, from the truth, and from
the mercy of God; ” (Msb;) as is indicated by the
pl. شَيَاطِينُ; [for] the reading of El-Hasan in the
Kur xxvi. 210, الشَّيَاطُونَ, is anomalous, [like
بَسَاتُونَ for بَسَاتِينُ,] and is said by Th to be a
mistake: (TA:) or, as some say, the ن is augmentative, (S, Msb, TA, *) and the ى is radical,
so that the word is of the measure فَعْلَان, (Msb,)
from شَاطَ, aor. يَشِيطُ, (Msb, TA,) signifying “ it
was, or became, null, void, of no account,” and
the like, and “ it burned,” or “ became burnt,”
(Msb,) or signifying “ he burned with anger: ”
but the former opinion is the more common:
(TA:) [in the Kur, the word is always perfectly
decl.; and so it is said to be by SM, in art. شيط
of the TA; unless used as a proper name: but J
says,] if you make it to be of the measure فَيْعَال
from تَشَيْطَنَ said of a man, [or rather because
they say of a man تشيطن,] you make it perfectly
decl.; but if you make it to be from شَيَّطَ [“ he
burned ” a thing], you make it imperfectly decl.,
because it is of the measure فَعْلَان. (S.) ―
-b2-  Also
The serpent: (S, K:) or a certain species of
serpents; (Fr, S, TA;) having a mane, of foul
aspect: or, as some say, a slender, light, or active,
serpent. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Respecting the saying in the
Kur [xxxvii. 63], طَلْعُهَا كَأَنَّهُ رُؤُوسُ الشَّيَاطِينِ
[Its fruit is as though it were the heads of the
شياطين], Fr says that there are three ways in
which it may be explained: one is, that the طلع
is likened to the heads of the شياطين [meaning
devils] in respect of foulness, or ugliness, because
these are described as foul, or ugly: (S:) or it is
likened to the evil in disposition of the jinn,
because these are imagined as foul, or ugly: Zj
says, in explaining it, that one says of a thing
deemed foul, or ugly, كَأَنَّهُ وَجْهُ شَيْطَانٍ [as
though it were the face of a devil], and كَأَنَّهُ رَأْسُ
شَيْطَانٍ [as though it were the head of a devil];
for though the شيطان is not seen, he is conceived
in the mind as the foulest, or ugliest, of things:
(TA:) the second is, that [the meaning is foul,
or ugly, serpents; for] the Arabs apply the name
شيطان to a sort of serpents, having a mane, foul,
or ugly, in the head and face: (S, TA: *) the
third is, that a certain foul, or ugly, plat is
named رُؤُوسُ الشَّيَاطِينِ; (S, TA;) which is expl.
in the K only as meaning a certain plant. (TA.)
―
-b4-  شَيْطَانُ الفَلَا [lit. The devil of the waterless
deserts] means (assumed tropical:)  thirst. (K.) ―
-b5-  شَيْطَانٌ signifies
also (assumed tropical:)  Any blamable faculty, or power, [or propensity,] of a man. (Er-Rághib, TA.) One says,
رَكِبَهُ شَيْطَانُهُ i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [His anger got the ascendency
over him; or] he was, or became, angry. (TA.)
And نَزَعَ شَيْطَانَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He plucked out his pride.
(TA.) ―
-b6-  Also, [probably as being likened to a
serpent,] (assumed tropical:)  A mark made with a hot iron in the
upper part of the haunch of a camel, perpendicularly, upon the thigh, extending to the hock; (K,
TA;) from the “ Tedhkireh ” of Aboo-'Alee;
(TA;) likewise called ↓ مُشَيْطَنَةٌ. (AZ, K, TA.)
الشَّيْطَانِيَّةُ A certain sect of the extravagant
zealots of [the schismatics called] the شِيعَة; so
named from [their founder] شَيْطَانُ الطَّاقِ, (TA,)
an appellation of Mohammad Ibn-En-Noaman.
(K and TA in art. طوق.)
مُشَاطِنٌ One who draws out the bucket from
the well بِشَطَنَيْنِ, (K, TA,) i. e. with two ropes.
(TA.)
مُشَيْطَنَةٌ: see شَيْطَانٌ, last sentence.
