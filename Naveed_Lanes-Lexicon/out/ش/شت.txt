شَتٌّ an inf. n. of 1 [q. v.] (S, Msb, K.) ―
-b2-
And signifying Separation, disunion, or dispersion: so in the saying, الحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ الَّذِى جَمَعَنَا مِنْ
شَتٍّ [Praise be to God who has brought us
together from a state of separation, disunion, or
dispersion]: (TA:) a saying mentioned by AA,
as heard by him from an Arab of the desert:
(S, TA:) and ↓ شَتَاتٌ is [similar in meaning,
being] likewise an inf. n. of 1; (S, A, K;) or it
is a subst. from the intrans. verb شَتَّ, (Msb,) and
signifies a state of separation or disunion; as in
the saying, أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمُ الشَّتَاتَ [I fear for you
separation, or disunion]. (TA.)
-A2-  Also i. q.
مُتَفَرِّقٌ [meaning Dissolved, broken up, discomposed, deranged, disorganized, disordered, or unsettled; and separated, disunited, dispersed, or
scattered]; as also ↓ شَتِيتٌ, (S, A, Msb,) [and
↓ شَتَاتٌ, as will be shown in what follows;] or
↓ شَتِيتٌ is syn. with مُفَرَّقٌ, [which is virtually the
same as مُتَفَرِّقٌ,] and مُشَتَّتٌ: (K:) the pl. of شَتٌّ
is أَشْتَاتٌ (S) [and شُتُوتٌ also, as will be shown by
an ex. in what follows]: and ↓ شَتَّى is pl. of
↓ شَتِيتٌ, like as مَرْضَى is of مَرِيضٌ; (Jel in xx.
55, and MF;) or, accord. to some, it is a sing.
noun. (MF.) One says أَمْرٌ شَتٌّ i. e. مُتَفَرِّقٌ [A
state of affairs dissolved, broken up, &c.]; (S;)
and [so] ↓ أَمْرٌ شَتَاتٌ, the latter word being an
inf. n. used as an epithet. (Ham p. 176.) And
↓ صَارَ جَمْعُهُمْ شَتِيتًا i. e. مُتَفَرِّقًا [Their company, or
congregated body, became separated, disunited,
dispersed, or scattered]. (A.) And جَاؤُوا أَشْتَاتًا
They came separated, disunited, dispersed, or
scattered; syn. مُتَفَرِّقِينَ: (S, Msb, K:) and so
↓ جاؤوا شَتَاتَ شَتَاتَ, (K,) in one copy of the K
شَتَاتَ وَشَتَاتَ; and MF allows ↓ شُتَاتَ, like ثُلَاثَ
and رُبَاعَ; but there is no apparent reason for the
repetition; and accord. to the L, the phrase as
transmitted from the authorities worthy of confidence is ↓ جَآءَ القَوْمُ شَتَاتًا and شَتَاتَ i. e. The
people, or party, came separated, &c. (TA.) And
↓ قَوْمٌ شَتَّى (S, Msb, K, TA) A people, or party,
separated, &c.; syn. مُتَفَرِّقُونَ: (Msb, TA:) or
consisting of sundry, or distinct, bodies; not of one
tribe. (K.) And إِنَّ المَجْلِسَ لَيَجْمَعُ شُتُوتًا مِنَ
النَّاسِ, (S, TA,) and مِنَ النَّاسِ ↓ شَتَّى, Verily the
assembly comprises sundry, or distinct, bodies of
men; (TA;) or men not of one tribe. (S TA.)
And ↓ أَشْيَآءُ شَتَّى [Things of sundry, or different,
or distinct, kinds or sorts]. (S.) أَزْوَاجًا مِنْ نَبَاتٍ
↓ شَتَّى, in the Kur xx. 55, means Sorts, of plants,
various, or different, in colours, tastes, &c. (Jel.)
↓ أُمَّهَاتُهُمْ شَتَّى see expl. voce أُمٌّ. And تَؤُوبُ ↓ شَتَّى
الحَلَبَهْ, a prov., see expl. voce حَالِبٌ.

places.
شُتَاتَ: see شَتٌّ.
شَتِيتٌ: see شَتٌّ, in four places. ثَغْرٌ شَتِيتٌ
means [Fore teeth] separate, or wide-apart, one
from another. (S, A, K.) Tarafeh says,
مِنْ شَتِيتٍ كَأَقَاحِ الرَّمْلِ غُرْ
[meaning From separate fore teeth like white
chamomiles of the sands: ثَغْرٍ being understood,
and غُرْ being for غُرٍّ]. (TA.)
شَتَّى: see شَتٌّ, in seven places: ―

شَتَّانَ بَيْنُهُمَا, (K, TA, but omitted in the CK,)
with damm to the ن of بين, (TA,) [Different,
or distinct, are they two: or widely different or
distinct are they two: or how very, or widely,
different or distinct, are they two! lit., the union
of them two is severed: or the interval between
them two is far-extending, or wide: or how
greatly is the union of them two severed! as will
be shown below.] AZ quotes, in his “ Nawádir,”
with بين in the nom. case, the following verse:
شَتَّانَ بَيْنُهُمَا فِى كُلِّ مَنْزِلَةٍ
هٰذَا يَخَافُ وَهٰذَا يَرْتَجِى أَبَدَا
[Different, or widely different, &c., are they two
in every predicament: this fears, and this hopes,
ever]. (TA.) The mansoob form, however, is
also employed (K, TA, but omitted in the CK)
by some of the Arabs in the above-mentioned
phrase, so that one says, شَتَّانَ بَيْنَهُمَا, مَا being
understood, as though one said, شَتَّ الَّذِى بَيْنَهُمَا
[meaning, as above explained, Different, or
widely different, &c., are they two: lit., separated, or disunited, or severed, is that which is
between them two: or far-extending, or wide, is
the interval between them two: or how greatly
separated, or severed, is the union between them
two!]: Hassán Ibn-Thábit says,
وَشَتَّانَ بَيْنَكُمَا فِى النَّدَى
وَفِى البَأْسِ وَالخُبْرِ وَالمَنْظَرِ
[And different, or widely different, &c., are ye
two in munificence and in valour and internal
state and external appearance]. (TA.) In like
manner also, [but with ما,] one says, شَتَّانَ مَا بَيْنَهُمَا,
(A, Msb, K,) accord. to Th. (TA.) This [as also,
consequently, the same phrase without ما] is
disallowed by As and IKt: IB, however,
says that this phrase occurs in the verses of
chaste Arabs: for instance, Abu-l-Aswad EdDuälee says,
وَشَتَّانَ مَا بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَكَ إِنَّنِى
عَلَى كُلِّ حَالٍ أَسْتَقِيمُ وَتَظْلَعُ
[And different, or widely different, &c., are I
and thou: for I, in every case, go erect, and thou
haltest]: and similar is the saying of El-Ba'eeth,
وَشَتَّانَ مَا بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَ ابْنِ خَالِدٍ
أُمَيَّةَ فِى الرِّزْقِ الَّذِى يَتَقَسَّمُ
[And different, or widely different, &c., are I
and Ibn-Khálid Umeiyeh, with respect to the
supplies for the wants of life that are divided
among mankind]. (TA.) One says also, شَتَّانَ
مَا هُمَا; (S, A, K;) and شَتَّانَ مَا عَمْرٌو وَأَخُوهُ; (S,
K;) Different, or distinct, or widely different, &c.,
are they two; and 'Amr and his brother: [lit.,
separate, or distinct, are they two; &c.: or remote
are they two, one from the other; &c.:] or how
greatly, or widely, are they two separated; &c.!
(S, A, K:) here ما is redundant; and in the
former phrase, هما is the agent of شتّان; as is the
former of the two nouns, to which the latter noun
is conjoined, in the latter phrase. (TA.) ElAashà says,
شَتَّانَ مَا يَوْمِى عَلَى كُورِهَا
وَيَوْمُ حَيَّانَ أَخِىجَابِرِ
[Different, or widely different, &c., are (or were)
my day upon her (the camel's) saddle, and the day
of Heiyán the brother of Jábir: in which, for يَوْمِى
and يَوْمُ, some read نَوْمِى and نَوْمُ]. (S, TA.)
And in like manner, [but without ما,] one says,
شَتَّانَ أَخُوهُ وَأَبُوهُ [Different, or widely different,
&c., are his brother and his father]. (TA.) [See
also an ex. in a verse cited voce دَائِمٌ, in art. دوم.]
―
-b2-  شَتَّانَ, is a preterite verbal noun, signifying
اِفْتَرَقَ, [and so expl. above,] accord. to many
authorities, [including most of the grammarians,]
and therefore they have made it a condition that
its agent must be what denotes more than one:
[for اشترطوا فى فعله التردّد, I read اشترطوا فى
فاعلهُ التعدّد, which agrees with what is afterwards
said in the TA and here; though the former phrase
may be so rendered as to convey essentially the
same meaning: but this condition is not necessary
if we render شتّان by بَعُدَ:] (TA:) or it signifies
تَبَاعَدَ and اِفْتَرَقَ; (Ibn-Umm-Kásim;) or بَعُدَ;
[and so expl. above;] (S, A, Msb, K;) and is inflected from شَتُتَ; (S, K;) [which is a verb not
used; in the CK, incorrectly, شَتَتَ;] the fet-hah
of the ن being the fet-hah originally pertaining
to the [final] ت [of the verb]; and this fet-hah
shows the word to be inflected from the preterite
verb, like as سَرْعَانَ is from سَرُعَ, and وَشْكَانَ from
وَشُكَ: (S:) or, accord. to Er-Radee, it implies
wonder, [like several verbs of the measure فَعُلَ,
as shown in remarks on هَيُؤَ &c.,] and means how
greatly separated, disunited, or severed, &c.!
(TA:) or, accord. to El-Marzookee and Hr and
Zj and some others, it is an inf. n.: El-Marzookee
says, in his Expos. of the Fs, that it is an inf. n.
of a verb not used, [namely شَتُتَ,] and is indecl.,
with fet-hah for its termination, because it is put
in the place of a pret. verb, being equivalent to
شَتَّ, [for شَتُتَ,] i. e., تَشَتَّتَ أَوْ تَفَرَّقَ جِدًّا [as expl.
above]: and Zj says that it is an inf. n. occupying
the place of a verb, of the measure فَعْلَان, and
therefore indecl., because differing thus from
others of its class: Aboo-'Othmán El-Mázinee
says that شَتَّان and سُبْحَان may receive tenween,
whether they be substs, or occupying the place of
substs.: upon which AAF observes that if شتّان
be in its proper place, it is a verbal noun, meaning شَتَّ: if with tenween, it is indeterminate; if
without tenween, determinate; and if translated
from its office of a verbal noun, and made a subst.
answering to التَّشْتِيتُ, and determinate, it is
similar to سبحان in the phrase سُبْحَانَ مِنْ عَلْقَمَةَ
الفَاخِرِ, which is a subst. answering to التَّنْزِيهُ.
(TA.) The ن in شَتَّان (sometimes, TA) receives
kesreh; (K;) though this is contr. to what is said
by AZ and by IDrst: its being sometimes with
kesreh is mentioned by Th, on the authority of
Fr: and Er-Radee seems to infer that its being
so was an opinion of As; and gives two reasons
for his disallowal of the expression شتّان ما بين;
first, because شتّان occurs with kesr to the ن; and
second, because its agent cannot be otherwise than
what denotes more than one: [but see what has
been observed above on this point:] IAmb says
that one must not say شَتَّانِ مَا بَيْنَ أَخِيكَ وَأَبِيكَ,
because, in this case, شتّان [virtually] governs
only one noun in the nom. case: but that one may
say, شَتَّانِ أَخُوكَ وَأَبُوكَ, and شَتَّانِ مَا أَخُوكَ وَأَبُوكَ,
using شَتَّانِ as the dual of شَتٌّ; though correctly
شتّان is a verbal noun: MF, however, observes
that the Expositors of the Fs seem to say that Fr
makes شَتَّانِ to be the dual of شَتٌّ; but that he
only mentions it as a dial. var. of شَتَّانَ: the following is adduced as an ex.
لَشَتَّانَ مَا أَنْوِى وَيَنْوِى بَنُو أَبِى
[Different, or widely different, &c., are that
which I intend and that which the sons of my
father intend]: in which شتّان is read with both
fet-hah and kesreh: and it is said in the O that
شَتَّانِ is a dial. var. of شَتَّانَ. (TA.) ―
-b3-  IJ mentions ↓ شَتَّى as an accidental syn. of شتّان; and
says that it is not the fem. of the latter: therefore
the assertion of some, that it is used by poetical
license in the following verse of Jemeel requires
consideration:
أُرِيدُ صِلَاحَهَا وَتُرِيدُ قَتْلِى
وَشَتَّى بَيْنَ قَتْلِى وَالصِّلَاحِ
[I desire to make peace with her, but she desires
to slay me: and different, or widely different,
&c., are slaying me and making peace]. (TA.)
