(TA:) or their expression of opinion was, or became, discordant: (تَفَرَّقَتْ كَلِمَتُهُمْ: K:) or they
died: and they became scattered, or dispersed; as
though there remained not of them save a remnant; [see شَوْلٌ;] النَّعَامَةُ signifying الجَمَاعَةُ:

such a state that their bellies [were drawn up as
though they] reached their backs: (K, TA:) or

quantity remaining] of milk: like as one says,
(O, TA,) شوّلت المَزَادَةُ The مزادة [or leathern
water-bag] had little water remaining in it: (O,
K, TA:) one should not say شَالَت. (TA.) ―

[here meaning shawl], made in Cashmere and
Lahore, and brought for sale to other countries;
[erroneously] said to be made of camels' fur; and

accord. to the reading of AO of that verse, it is
↓ شُوُلٌ, which has a similar, but intensive, meaning. (De Sacy's Chrest. Ar., 2nd ed., ii. 484-5.)
See also what next follows.]

stars, near together, [
λ and
ν,] (S, O,) in the end

And شَوْلَةُ is a proper name for The scorpion;
(O, TA;) [and] so ↓ شَوَّالَةُ. (K, TA.)
-A2-  Also A
foolish, or stupid, woman. (IAar, O, K.) شَوْلَةُ
was the name of A certain foolish female slave,
belonging to [the tribe of] 'Adwán, and she used
to give advice to her masters, and it resulted in
evil to them; whence the saying, أَنْتَ شَوْلَةُ النَّاصِحَةُ

termed عُشْب, growing in plain, or soft, land,
(AHn, O,) used as a medicament, (AHn, O, K,)
and well known: (AHn, O:) [Sgh says,] I have
seen it: it is dust-coloured, spreads upon the
ground, has no thorns, and the cattle eagerly
desire it: (O:) it is called (O, K) sometimes, (K,)
by some of the people of El-'Irák, (O,) ↓ شُوَّيْلٌ,

month of the festival of the breaking of the fast;
(Msb, K; *) the month next after رَمَضَان; (TA;)
the first of the months of the pilgrimage; (S, O;)
[the tenth month of the lunar year:] as some
assert, (IDrd, O,) so called because [when first
thus named] it coincided with the season when
the she-camels [being seven or eight months gone
with young] raised their tails: (IDrd, O, Msb,
TA:) [for the camels generally couple in winter:]
or because of their milk becoming then withdrawn; such being the case with the camels in
the time of vehement heat and of the coming to an
end of the juicy fresh herbage: [see a table of the
months voce زَمَنٌ:] the Arabs used to regard the
making of marriage-contracts in this month as of
evil omen; and to say that the woman [then]
married would resist him who married her, like
as the she-camel resists the stallion and raises her
tail; but the Prophet abolished their thus auguring, and he married 'Áïsheh in this month:
(TA:) the pl. is شَوَّالَاتٌ and شَوَاوِيلُ (S, Msb, K)

دُخَّلٌ q. v.], of a dusky colour, which, when it
alights upon a stone or a tree, moves up and down
its tail like as does the camel; so called because
it raises its tail; and in its belly and its hinder
part is somewhat of redness. (AHát, O, TA.) ―
-b2-
See also شَوْلَةٌ. ―
-b3-  [Hence, as being likened to the
scorpion, whence also the phrase إِنَّهُ لَتَدِبُّ عَقَارِبُهُ,]
اِمْرَأَةٌ شَوَّالَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  A woman wont to calumniate. (K.)
شَائِلٌ A she-camel raising her tail, (S, O, Msb,
K,) having conceived, (Msb,) or by reason of
having conceived, and having no milk whatever:
(S, O, K:) or a she-camel that has conceived, and
raises her tail to the stallion as a sign of her
having conceived, raising her head therewith, and
elevating her nose: (Az, TA:) the word is without
ة because it is an epithet of peculiar application
[to a female]: (Msb:) or it is without ة anomalously; for the male also raises his tail: (ISd,
TA:) the pl. is شُوَّلٌ (Az, S, O, Msb, K) and شُيَّلٌ
and شِيَّلٌ and شُوَّالٌ. (K.) Also, with ة, applied to
a mare, as meaning Raising the tail. (TA.) ―

K, and so in a copy of the S,) or whose
milk has become scanty, (خَفَّ لَبَنُهَا, O, and
so in another copy of the S,) and her udder
drawn up, (S, O,) there remaining in her udder
no more than a شَوْل, a third of the quantity of the
contents thereof when her bringing forth was
recent: (TA:) she-camels in this case are termed
↓ شَوْلٌ, (S, O, K,) an anomalous pl., (K,) [or
rather a quasi-pl. n.,] expl. by some as applied to
she-camels whose milk has become deficient, which
is the case when their young are weaned at the
period of the [auroral] rising of سُهَيْل [or Canopus, a period which commenced, in Central Arabia,
about the beginning of the era of the Flight, on
the 4th of August, O. S.], and they cease not to
be thus termed until the stallion is sent among
them; (TA;) the pl. pl. [or pl. of شَوْلٌ] is أَشْوَالٌ;
(K;) and شَوَائِلُ is a pl. of شَائِلَةٌ meaning [as expl.
above, or] a she-camel whose milk has become
withdrawn. (TA.) ―

Anything that is raised, or drawn up, or withdrawn. (TA.)
