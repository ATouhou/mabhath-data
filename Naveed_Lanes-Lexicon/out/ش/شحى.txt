شحى1
شَحِىَ, like رَضِىَ, inf. n. شَحْىٌ, is said by
ISd and in the K to be a dial. var. of شَحَا, inf. n.
شَحْوٌ, i. e., as ISd says, meaning He opened his
mouth; but the latter, he says, is the better
known: this, however, requires consideration:
for it is said in the Tekmileh that شَحَى فُلَانٌ,
aor. يَشْحَى, inf. n. شَحْىٌ, is a dial. var. of [شَحَا,
aor.] يَشْحُو, inf. n. شَحْوٌ, on the authority of Lth.
(TA.)
