شر1
شَرَّ, (L, K,) sec. pers. شَرِرْتَ, (S, Msb, K,
MF,) aor. يَشَرُّ; (L, Msb, MF;) and sec. pers.
شَرُرْتَ, (S accord. to some copies, L, Msb, K,
MF,) aor. يَشُرُّ; (L, Msb, K, * MF;) and sec. pers.
شَرَرْتَ, (S accord. to some copies, M, K, MF,)
aor. يَشِرُّ; (M, K, MF;) of which three vars. the
first is the best known; and the last is strange,
and disallowed by most authorities; (MF;) inf. n.
[of the first or third] شَرٌّ (S, K) and [of the first]
شَرَرٌ (S) and [of the second or third] شَرَارَةٌ, (S, K,)
and شِرَّةٌ also is an inf. n. [syn. with شَرٌّ]; (S;)
He (a man) was, or became, evil, a wrongdoer,
unjust, bad, corrupt, wicked, mischievous, vitious,
or depraved. (S, * L, Msb, K, * &c.) The manner
in which the K mentions شَرَّ with the two aors.
يَشُرُّ and يَشِرُّ [only, omitting the most common
aor., i. e. يَشَرُّ,] obviously demands consideration.
(MF.) One says, شَرِرْتَ يَا رَجُلُ [Thou hast been
evil, or a wrongdoer, &c., O man], (S, K,) and
so شَرُرْتَ and شَرَرْتَ. (S accord. to different copies,
and K.) ―
-b2-  شَرَّ, aor. يَشَرُّ, also signifies He increased in evil, wrongdoing, &c. (L.) It is said
in a prov., كُلَّمَا تَكْبَرُ تَشَرُّ [In proportion as thou
growest old, thou increasest in evil, &c.]. (AZ,
L.) ―
-b3-  مَا شَرَّهُ: see 4, last sentence.
-A2-  شَرَّهُ, (O,
K,) aor. يَشُرُّ, (O, TA,) inf. n. شُرٌّ, (O, K,) with
damm, (K, [which is said in the TA to indicate
that the aor., not the inf. n., is with damm, but
this is inconsistent with the common practice of
the author of the K, and is evidently wrong,])
He blamed him; found fault with him; attributed
or imputed to him, charged him with, or accused
him of, a vice, fault, defect, blemish, or something
amiss. (O, K, * TA. [See also 4.]) One says,
مَا قُلْتُ ذَاكَ لِشُرِّكَ وَإِنَّمَا قُلْتُةُ لِغَيْرِ شُرِّكَ I said not
that to find fault with thee, but I only said it for
a different purpose than that of finding fault with
thee: (S, TA:) or this has a different meaning,
which see below, voce شُرٌّ. (TA.) One says also,
قَدْ قَبِلْتُ عَطِيَّتَكَ ثُمَّ رَدَدْتُهَا عَلَيْكَ مِنْ غَيْرِ شُرِّكَ وَلَا
ضُرِّكَ, meaning [I have accepted thy gift; then I
have given it back to thee] without rejecting it to
thee or blaming thee [and without injuring thee].
(IAar, TA.)
-A3-  Also شَرَّهُ, (S,) or شَرَّهُ فِى الشَّمْسِ,
(A,) [aor. and inf. n. as in the next sentence;]
and ↓ شرّرهُ, (A,) inf. n. تَشْرِيرٌ; (S;) and ↓ اشرّهُ;
and ↓ شَرْشَرَهُ; (A;) He spread it (i. e. a garment,
or piece of cloth, S, or some other thing, TA) in
the sun: (S, A, TA:) this is the primary signification. (TA.) And [hence,] شَرَّهُ, (S, K,) aor.
يَشُرُّ. (S,) inf. n. شَرٌّ; (S, K;) and ↓ اشرّهُ, (K,)
inf. n. إِشْرَارٌ; (TA;) and ↓ شرّرهُ, (K,) inf. n. as
above; (TA;) and شَرَّاهُ [or شَرَاهُ without tesh-deed?]; (K;) He put it (i. e. [the preparation of
curd called] أَقْط, and flesh-meat, S, K, and the
like, and salt, S, and a garment, or piece of cloth,
and the like, K) upon a خَصَفَة, (S, K,) i. e. a

-b2-  أَشَرُّوهُ
They banished him, or drove him away, and
caused him to be alone. (TA.)
-A2-  See also 1, latter
part, in two places. ―
-b2-  [Hence, app.,] اشرّهُ signifies
also (tropical:)  He manifested it, revealed it, published
it, or made it known. (S, A, K.) Thus in a verse
of Imra-el-Keys, where he says, لَوْ يُشِرُّونَ مَقْتَلِى
(assumed tropical:)  [that they might publish, or make known, my
slaughter]; as related by As; but it is better with
س. (S.)
-A3-  مَا أَشَرَّهُ, and ↓ مَا شَرَّهُ, [the latter of
which is extr. with respect to form, but more
commonly used than the former, meaning How
evil, wrongdoing, unjust, bad, corrupt, wicked,
mischievous, vitious, or depraved, is he!] phrases
similar to مَا أَخْيَرَهُ and مَا خَيْرَهُ [which have the
contr. meaning]. (TA in art. خير.)

شَرٌّ (S, A, Msb, K, &c.) and ↓ شُرٌّ, (Kr, K,) the
former of which is the more chaste, (TA,) and ↓ شِرَّةٌ
(Ham p. 629) Evil, [moral and physical;] (L, Msb;)
wrongdoing, injustice, badness, corruptness, wickedness, mischievousness, vitiousness, or depravity:
(Msb:) [and evil fortune, misfortune, woe, or
unhappiness:] contr. of خَيْرٌ: (S, A, K:) pl. شُرُورٌ.
(Msb, K.) It is said in a trad., in a form of
prayer, (TA,) used by the Prophet, (Msb,)
وَالخَيْرُ كُلُّهُ بِيَدَيْكَ وَالشَّرُّ لَيْسَ إِلَيْكَ, (Msb, * TA,)
meaning [And all good is in thy hands, and evil
i. e.] wrongdoing, or injustice, or corruptness, is
not imputable to Thee: (Msb, TA:) or evil is not
a means of advancement in thy favour, or of
obtaining thine approval: or evil speech does not
ascend to Thee. (Nh, L.) ―
-b2-  شَرٌّ also signifies
(assumed tropical:)  Poverty. (K.) ―
-b3-  And (assumed tropical:)  Fever. (K.) ―
-b4-  It is
also an epithet, applied to a man, (Yoo, S,) and so
is ↓ شَرِيرٌ, (Akh, S, A, Msb, K,) meaning Evil,
wrongdoing, unjust, bad, corrupt, wicked, mischievous, vitious, or depraved: (Yoo, * Akh, * S, *
A, * Msb, K: *) [fem. of the former شَرَّةٌ, like as
خَيْرَةٌ is fem. of its contr. خَيْرٌ; and شُرَّى, fem. of
أَشَرُّ, is used in the same sense, as will be shown
in what follows:] the pl. of شَرٌّ, (Yoo, S,) or of
↓ شَرِيرٌ, (Akh, S, Msb, K,) is أَشْرَارٌ, (Yoo, Akh, S,
Msb, K,) and of the former شِرَارٌ; (Ham p. 514;)
and you say قَوْمٌ أَشِرَّآءُ [pl. of شَرٌّ or of ↓ شَرِيرٌ].
(S.) A woman of the Arabs, (S, L,) who, accord.
to some, was of the Benoo-'Ámir, (L,) is related to

meaning [I charm thee by invoking God, against
a thirsty soul, and] an evil, or a malignant, eye:
(S, L:) or an eye that looks at one with vehement
hatred. (TA.) And الشَّرُّ [The evil one] is an
appellation of Iblees. (K.) ―
-b5-  [It is also used to
denote the comparative and superlative degrees;
like the contr. خَيْرٌ.] You say, هُوَ شَرٌّ مِنْكَ [He is
worse, or more evil or wrongdoing &c., than thou].
(K.) And هٰذَا شَرٌّ مِنْ ذَاكَ [This is worse, &c.,
than that]. (Msb.) And فُلَانٌ شَرُّ النَّاسِ [Such a
one is the worst, &c., of mankind]; (S;) and

(Mgh, Msb,) but rare, (K,) or bad, (S, K,)
peculiar to the dial. of the Benoo-'Ámir, (Msb,)
or unused. (Mgh.) The fem. [of شَرٌّ] is شَرَّةٌ, [like
as the fem. of its contr., خَيْرٌ, is خَيْرَةٌ,] (K,) and
(of أَشَرُّ, S, * or of شَرٌّ, which is used for أَشَرُّ, Kr)
↓ شُرَّى. (S, Kr, K.) And [using the dim. form
of شَرٌّ,] you say, مِنْكَ ↓ هُوَ شُرَيْرٌ [He is a little

شُرٍّ بِهِ I did not give this back to thee on account
of any fault &c., in it, but I preferred to give
it to thee. (TA.) And مَا قُلْتُ ذَاكَ لِشُرِّكَ I said
not that on account of a thing that thou disapprovest, &c.: (K, TA:) or this has a different
meaning, expl. above in the first paragraph. (TA.)

there is an eagerness for this Kur-án: then men
have a weariness of it]. (L.)
شَرَرٌ; n. un. with ة: see what next follows.
شَرَارٌ, (S, A, O, Msb, TA,) accord. to the K
شِرَارٌ, but this is a mistake, (MF,) and ↓ شَرَرٌ, (S,
A, O, Msb, K,) which is a contraction of شَرَارٌ,
(Msb,) Sparks of fire: (S, O, Msb, K:) n. un.

that emits many sparks, and thou art a spark
from it]. (A.)

gnats], (S, K,) which cover the face of a man,
but do not bite; sometimes called الأَذَى: (S:) of
the dial. of the people of Es-Sawád: (T, TA:) [it is
with tenween; for] the n. un. is with ة. (K.)
شِرِّيرٌ (S, A, K) Abounding in شَرّ [or evil or
wrongdoing &c.; very evil &c.]; applied to a man:
(S, A:) pl. شِرِّيرُونَ (K) and أَشْرَارٌ, which latter is
anomalous. (Ham. p. 699.)
شَرْشَرٌ, (IAar, S, K,) or (so in the S, but in the
K “ and ”) ↓ شِرْشِرٌ, (Ibn-Ziyád, S, K,) A certain
plant, (S, K,) which extends along the ground like
ropes, (Ibn-Ziyád, AHn, K,) in the same manner
as the قُطْب, but having no thorns that hurt any
one: (Ibn-Ziyád, AHn:) Az says that it is a
well-known plant, seen by him in the desert;
that it fattens the camels, and makes their milk
plentiful; and that it is mentioned by IAar and
others among the plants of the desert: ↓ شِرْشِرَةٌ is
expl. in the K as though it were the name of
another plant; but it is not so; for شِرْشِرٌ is the
pl. [or rather coll. gen. n.] thereof: it is a herb
smaller than the عَرْفَج, having a yellow flower, and
twigs, or shoots, and large dust-coloured leaves:
it grows in plain, or soft, ground; and spreads
wide, as though it were ropes, by reason of length,
of the measure of a man in a standing posture;
and has berries (حَبّ), like those of the هَرَاس.
(TA.)

or ↓ شُرْشُرَةٌ, (so in other copies of the K, accord. to
the TA,) sing. of شَرَاشِرُ, (K,) which signifies The
fringe-like extremities of a tail; (S, * K, * A, TA;)
and of wings. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Hence, metaphorically,
[or synecdochically,] the pl. is used as signifying
(tropical:)  The whole: and hence the saying, أَلْقَى عَلَيْهِ
شَرَاشِرَهُ (tropical:)  He betook himself altogether to it; as
though, says As, by reason of his eagerness, he
threw himself altogether upon it: accord. to EshShiháb, it means he betook himself [to it], openly
or secretly: or شَرَاشِرُ signifies (assumed tropical:)  the whole body;
(K;) and القى عليه شراشره and أَجْرَانَهُ and أَجْرَامَهُ,
provs. mentioned by Meyd, all signify the same
[app. (assumed tropical:)  he threw upon it the weight of his body:
see Freytag's Arab. Prov., ii. 409 and 410: and
see art. جرم]: or the first of these means (assumed tropical:)  he
loved it so that he courted death, or destruction,
(اِسْتَهْلَكَ,) in his love of it: (TA:) or he loved it
with a love that he would not give up, because of
his necessity: (Lth, TA:) or (tropical:)  he desired it inordinately, or eagerly, and loved it. (A.) [See
also أَلْقَى عَلَيْهِ أَرْوَاقَهُ, voce رَوْقٌ. Accord. to different authorities,] شَرَاشِرُ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  Burdens,
or weights; (S, K;) sing. شَرْشَرَةٌ: (S:) and it is so
expl. as used in the saying mentioned above: or
it there signifies (assumed tropical:)  weight, and whole person: or
the reduplication implies intensiveness; as though
this word originally signified weight of evil: but
F, in his comments on the Preface of the Ksh,
objects to this, as the word does not imply the
contr. of خَيْرٌ, but dispersion. (TA.) Also (tropical:)  Self:
(K, TA:) and the saying mentioned above is expl.
as meaning (tropical:)  He threw himself upon it, through
inordinate, or eager, desire, and love. (S, TA.)
And (assumed tropical:)  Love: (K:) or (assumed tropical:)  love of self. (Kr, TA.)
شُرْشُرَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
شِرْشِرَةٌ A piece of anything. (K.)
-A2-  See also
شَرْشَرٌ.
شُرْشُورٌ A certain bird, (K, TA,) of small size;
said by As to be thus called by the people of El-
Hijáz; and by the Arabs of the desert, بَرْقَش [a
mistranscription for بِرْقِش]: it is said to be dustcoloured; in elegance, like the حُمَّرَة; and to be a
little larger than the عُصْفُور [or sparrow]. (L,
TA.) [Freytag, on the authority of Dmr, says
that it is the same as is called ابو براقش: (but see
بِرْقِشٌ:) and describes it as being of an ashy
colour, with some mixture of redness; and of the
passerine kind.]
أَشَرُّ; and its fem., شُرَّى: see شَرٌّ, latter half, in
three places. ―
-b2-  شُرَّى is also applied to a woman
as meaning A great imputer of vices, faults, or
the like, to others. (AA, L.)
إِشْرَارَةٌ A خَصَفَة, (S, K,) i. e. mat, (TA,) upon
which [the preparation of curd called] أَقِط (S,
K) and other things (S) are spread (S, K *) to
dry; (TA;) [as also ↓ مَشَرُّ or ↓ مِشَرٌّ, as written in
different copies of the S voce عَبَثَت:] or a piece
of cloth, of those whereof a tent is composed, used
for that purpose: (TA:) or a tablet of stone or
wood, upon which flesh-meat is dried: (Lth,
IAar:) pl. أَشَارِيرُ: or this pl. signifies pieces of
flesh-meat cut into strips and dried: (S:) or the
sing. signifies also flesh-meat cut into strips and
dried. (K, TA.)
-A2-  Also A great herd of camels:
(K:) because scattered. (TA.)
مَشَرٌّ or مِشَرٌّ: see the next preceding paragraph.
