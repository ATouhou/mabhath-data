expl. by Lth and IF and Ibn-'Abbád: (O:) or the
correct word is شَصَا, or شَطَرَ; (so accord. to
different copies of the K, the latter being the
reading in the TA;) or both; for Az says that

mistake, and that it is correctly شَصَا بَصَرُهُ and
شَطَرَ, meaning that he was as though he looked at
thee and at another. (O, TA. *)

and ↓ شَوْصَرٌ (K) The young one of the gazelle,
when he has become strong and active: (A 'Obeyd,
S, L, &c.:) in the K, when he has become strong,
but not active; but this is a mistake: (TA:) or

horn: or that has become a month old: or that
has not yet cropped the herbage [but only sucked
his mother]; expl. by الَّذِى لَمْ يَحْتَنِكْ: (K:)
A 'Obeyd states that it is said by more than one of
the Arabs of the desert that the young one of the
gazelle is called طَلًا; then, خِشْفٌ; and when his
horns come forth, شَادِنٌ; and when he has become
strong and active, شَصَرٌ, of which the fem. [as is
also said in the K] is شَصَرَةٌ; then, جَذَعٌ; and
then, ثَنِىٌّ, which name he continues to have
until he dies: (S:) [perhaps correctly corresponding to our six terms which are as follows: a fawn
(applied to a buck or doe of the first year), a
pricket (to a buck of the second year), a sorel
(to a buck of the third year), a sore (to a buck of
the fourth year), a buck of the first head (to one
of the fifth year), and a great buck (to one of the
sixth year):] or ↓ شَاصِرٌ is applied to a young

operation termed تَزْنِيدٌ [which is that described
above in the explanation of شَصَرَ النَّاقَةَ] is performed; (IDrd, S, K;) as also ↓ شِصْرٌ: (K:) or
↓ شِصْرَانِ, or شِصَارَانِ, is a term applied to two
pieces of wood, which are thrust through the edge
of the rectum of a she-camel, and then bound with
a strong string of the fibres of the palm-tree,
behind them: this is done when they desire to
make a she-camel affect the young one of another:
they take a stuffed دُرْجَة [q. v.], and insert it into
her rectum, and transfix the rectum with two
sharp-pointed pieces of wood, which they bind as
above described: this operation is termed ↓ شَصْرٌ
and تَزْنِيدٌ. (ISh.) [See also 1.] ―

the form,]) like عُلُوٌّ, (TA,) His eye, or eyes,
became fixedly open, or raised, or stretched and
raised, or his eyelids became raised and he looked
intently and became disquieted or disturbed, syn.

wrong]; (TA; [see also شَظَى;]) said of a corpse;
(Ks, S, K;) Its arms and legs rose, or rose high;
(K;) or it became inflated, or swollen, and its
arms and legs rose, or rose high. (Ks, S.) ―
