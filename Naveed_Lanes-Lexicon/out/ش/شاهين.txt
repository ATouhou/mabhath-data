شاهينشَاهِينٌ A certain well-known bird, (K, TA,)
of those that prey; (Msb, * TA;) it is of the
birds called صُقُور [pl. of صَقْرٌ], as are also the
بَاشَق and the بَازِى and the زُرَّق and the يُؤْيُؤ;
(AHát in “ the Book of Birds,” TA in art. بشق;)
[said by Golius, on the authority of Dmr, to be
the white falcon; and to this bird it is perhaps
applied by some of the Arabs; but some of them,
I believe most of them, and I believe also that
they do so most properly, apply this appellation
in the present day to the gerfalcon, which is not
wholly white; and some, to the falcon gentle:]
the word is [of Pers. origin,] not genuine Arabio;
(TA;) it is an arabicized word: the pl. is
شَوَاهِينُ, and sometimes شَيَاهِينُ is used in its
stead, formed by substituion [of ى for و] for
facilitating the pronunciation. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  Also
(assumed tropical:)  The عَمُود [meaning beam] of the balance.
(K.) ―
-b3-  And i. q. صَنْجَةٌ [which signifies A
balance, and a steelyard, and a weight of a
balance]: so in the Expos. of the “ Muwatta. ”
(MF, TA.)
