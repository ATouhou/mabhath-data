[namely, a horse or the like;] he put the bit

الوَالِىَ, (S, K,) aor. and inf. n. as above, (TA,)
(tropical:)  He bribed the والى [i. e. prefect, or the like];
as though he stopped his mouth with the شَكِيمَة,
(S, K, TA,) i. e. the [bit, or] iron thing of the
لِجَام. (TA.) And شَكَمَ فَاهُ بِالإِتَاوَةِ i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [He

inf. n.; (K;) and ↓ اشكمهٌ; (Th, K;) He repaid,
requited, compensated, or recompensed, him; (S,
K; *) or gave him what is termed شُكْم [q. v.]:

شُكْمٌ (S, K, &c.) and ↓ شُكْمَى; (K;) of the latter,
ISd says, “I think it to be a dial. var., but I am
not certain of it; ” (TA;) A repayment, requital,
compensation, or recompense; (El-Umawee,
A' Obeyd, S, K;) and شُكْبٌ is a dial. var. thereof:
(TA:) when the gift is initial, it is termed شُكْدٌ:
(S:) or a substitute; or thing given, received,
put, or done, by way of replacement or exchange:
(Ks, TA:) and (K) a gift; (As, K, TA;) as also
شُكْدٌ; (As, TA;) or the latter signifies a gift
without compensation: (TA:) or شُكْمٌ signifies a
benefaction, bounty, or gratuity; syn. نُعْمَى.
(Lth, TA.)
شَكِمٌ A lion: (K:) expl. in this sense as occurring in a verse of Aboo-Sakhr El-Hudhalee: or,
accord. to Skr, as there used, quickly, or soon,

شُكْمَى: see شُكْمٌ.
شَكِيمٌ: see شَكِيمَةٌ, in three places. ―

loop-shaped handles of the cooking-pot. (S, K.)
[
شَكَامَةٌ expl. by Golius as meaning “ Malitia
indolis, contumacia,” as on the authority of the
KL, is app. a mistake for شَكَاسَةٌ, which I find
expl. in the KL as signifying the “ being evil in
nature, or natural disposition,” but not شكامة. ―
-b2-
Freytag explains it as meaning also Likeness; a
signification of شَكِيمَةٌ, also mentioned by him;
but for this he names no authority, and I know of
none.]
شَكِيمَةٌ, in the لِجَام, [The bit-mouth, or mouthpiece of a pit; i. e.] the transverse piece of iron
in the mouth of the horse, in which is the فَأْس
[q. v.]; (S, K;) as also ↓ شَكِيمٌ: (S:) [see also
لِجَامٌ, and مِسْحَلٌ:] or ↓ شَكِيمٌ is pl. of شَكِيمَةٌ, as
also شَكَائِمُ and شُكُمٌ, (K, TA,) this last with two
dammehs, [but written in the CK شُكْمٌ,] or [rather
↓ شَكِيمٌ is a coll. gen. n., and] شُكُمٌ is said by some
to be pl. of شَكِيمٌ, not of شَكِيمَةٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Hence,
[as used in phrases mentioned below,] (TA,)
(tropical:)  Resistance, or incompliance: (S, TA:) disdain,
scorn, or disdainful and proud incompliance or
refusal: and self-defence from wrong treatment:
(K:) and self-magnification, pride, or haughtiness; syn. شَمَمٌ; السَّمُّ in the copies of the K being
a mistake for الشَّمَمُ: (TA:) firmness, strength, or
vehemence, of spirit; (TA, and Ham p. 140;)
and evilness of nature or disposition: (Ham
ibid:) strength of heart: (IAar, TA:) hardiness;
courage, or courage and energy; or determination; syn. عَارِضَةٌ: vigorousness, strenuousness, or
energy: (TA:) also [simply] nature, or natural
disposition; syn. طَبْعٌ. (K, TK: in the CK الطَّبَعُ
is [erroneously] put in the place of الطَّبْعُ.) One
says, فُلَآنٌ ذُو شَكِيمَةٍ (tropical:)  Such a one is resistant, or
incompliant: (S, TA:) or disdainful, or scornful;
resistant, unyielding, or incompliant: one who
defends himself from wrong treatment: proud:
hardy: courageous: one possessing prudence or
discretion, or firmness or soundness of judgment.
(TA.) And فُلَانٌ شَدِيدُ الشَّكِيمَةِ, meaning [in
like manner] (tropical:)  Such a one is firm, strong, or
vehement, of spirit; (S, TA, and Ham p. 140;)
disdainful, or scornful; resistant, unyielding, or

or, as some say, one possessing strength, or vehemence, of tongue; and perspicuity, or eloquence,
of speech or language; or perspicuity of speech
with quickness, or sharpness, of intellect; and
much hardiness, or courage, or courage and
energy, or determination. (Ham p. 140.) ―
-b3-
Also (assumed tropical:)  Likeness, or resemblance. (K.) ―
-b4-  And
(assumed tropical:)  A compact, or covenant; syn. عَهْدٌ: (K, TA:)
in some copies of the K, الفَهْدُ is erroneously put
for العَهْدُ. (TA.)
شكو and شكى
1
شَكَا, (K,) first pers. شَكَوْتُ, (S, Msb,) of
which شَكَيْتُ is a dial. var., (K in art. شكى,)
aor.
1َ2ُ3َ, (S, Msb,) [and of the latter
1َ2ِ3َ,] inf. n.
شَكْوٌ, (S, Msb,) or شَكْوَى, (K,) or this is a simple
subst., (S, Msb,) also pronounced شَكْوًى, (K,)
and شِكَايَةٌ, (S, K,) with kesr, (K,) in which the
ى is [said to be] substituted for و because most
inf. ns. of the measure فِعَالَةٌ of verbs ending with
an infirm radical letter are of verbs of which that
letter is ى, (TA,) or this also is a simple subst.,
(Msb,) and شَكَاةٌ, (S, K,) or this too is a simple
subst., (Msb,) and شَكَاوَةٌ, (K,) and شَكِيَّةٌ, (S, K,)
is a trans. verb; (S, Msb, K;) and ↓ اشتكى signifies the same; (S, K;) as also ↓ تشكّى: (K:)
one says, شَكَا أَمْرَهُ إِلَى اللّٰهِ and ↓ اشتكى [i. e.
اشتكى أَمْرَهُ], and ↓ تشكّى [i. e. تشكّى أَمْرَهُ], (K,
TA,) meaning [He complained of his case to
God; or] he told to God the weakness of his
condition: (TA:) and شَكَوْتُ فُلَانًا and ↓ اِشْتَكَيْتُهُ
[I complained to such a one of his conduct to
me]; (S;) [or] شَكَا فُلَانًا means he told such a one
of his evil conduct to him: (TA:) and شَكَا فُلَانًا
إِلَى فُلَانٍ He complained of such a one to such a
one: (MA:) [and شَكَوْتُ إِلَيْهِ كَذَا I complained
to him of such a thing:] see 4: and [in like manner] إِلَيْهِ كَذَا ↓ اشتكى He complained to him of
such a thing: (MA:) and مِنْهُ ↓ اِشْتَكَيْتُ [I complained of him, or it; like شَكَوْتُهُ]: (Msb:) Er-Rághib says, الشِكَايَةُ is The showing, or revealing,
of grief, or sorrow; whence the saying in the
Kur [xii. 86], إِنَّمَا أَشْكُو بَثِّى وَحُزْنِى إِلَى اللّٰهِ [I
only show my grief and my lamentation to God];
and in the same [lviii. 1], إِلَى اللّٰهِ ↓ وَتَشْتَكِى [And
showeth her grief, or sorrow, to God]; the primary signification of الشَّكْوُ being the opening of
the small skin for water or milk called شَكْوَة, and
showing what is in it; so that it is as though
originally metaphorical [though what is termed
حَقِيقَةٌ عُرْفِيَّةٌ (expl. in art. حق)]; like the phrases
بَثَثْتُ لَهُ مَا فِى وِعَائِى and نَفَضْتُ لَهُ مَا فِى جِرَابِى,
meaning “ I showed him what was in my heart. ”
(TA.) ―
-b2-  شَكَا is also said of a camel as meaning
He stretched out his neck, and made much moaning,
or prolonged utterance of a complaining voice,
being fatigued by journeying. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And
شَكَاهُ, (MA, K, TA,) inf. n. شَكْوٌ and شَكَاةٌ and
شَكْوَى, (MA, TA,) is said in relation to a disease,
or sickness; (MA, K, TA;) meaning He (a
diseased, or sick, person) complained of it, namely,
his disease, or sickness; (MA; [accord. to the
TK, followed in this case, as in many others, by
Freytag, it means it (i. e. disease, or sickness,)
afflicted him; which I think to be indubitably a
mistake;]) and ↓ تشكّى and ↓ اشتكى signify the
same [as شَكَا مَرَضَهُ he complained of his disease,
or sickness]: (TA:) [or] these two verbs (تشكّى
and اشتكى) signify [or signify also] he was, or
became, diseased, or sick. (TA in additions at
the end of this art.) One says also, ↓ اشتكى
عُضْوًا مِنْ أَعْضَائِهِ and ↓ تشكّى, both meaning the
same [i. e., originally, He complained of a pain,
or disease, in some one of his members; but
generally meaning he had a complaint of, or a
pain or a disease in, some one of his members;
and شَكَا عُضْوًا not unfrequently occurs used in the
same sense]: (S:) [thus one often says of a brute;
for ex.,] As says, in explaining القُلَابُ as meaning
“ a certain disease that attacks the camel,”
مِنْهُ قَلْبَهُ ↓ يَشْتَكِى [he has a pain in consequence
thereof in his heart; in which قَلْبَهُ, though
determinate, may be considered as an explicative,
like بَطْنَهُ in the phrase أَلِمَ بَطْنَهُ, q. v.]. (S in art.
قلب.) ―
-b4-  One says also, هُوَ يُشْكَى بِكَذَا, meaning
He is accused, or suspected, of such a thing; syn.
يُتَّهَمُ بِهِ: (K: [there mentioned as though it were
from أُشْكِىَ, and held to be so by the author of the
TK; but it is from شُكِىَ; as though meaning he
is complained of by reason of such a thing:])
mentioned by Yaakoob, in the “ Alfádh. ” (TA.)
-A2-  شكى فُلَانٌ [thus in my original, app. شَكَا or
شَكَى,] is mentioned by Az as meaning The nails
of such a one became split in several, or many,
places. (TA.)
2
شَكَّتِ النِّسَآءُ, inf. n. تَشْكِيَةٌ; and ↓ اشتكت; and
↓ تشكّت; (K;) or, accord. to Th, only this last;
(TA;) The women took for themselves, or made,
a شَكْوَة [q. v.] for the churning of milk; (K,
TA;) because it was little in quantity; the شكوة
being small, so that only a small quantity can be
churned in it: (TA:) or, as in the T, شكّى and
↓ تشكّى he took for himself, or made, a شَكْوَة:
(TA:) [or] so ↓ اشتكى: (S:) and so ↓ اشكى.
(IKtt, TA.)
-A2-  شَكَّى شَاكِيَهُ, inf. n. تَشْكِيَةٌ, expl.
in the K as meaning كَفَّ عَنْهُ and طَيَّبَ نَفْسَهُ, is
a foul mistranscription: correctly, سَلَّى شَاكِيَهُ,
meaning “ He comforted his complainer, and
consoled him for that which had befallen him; ”
as in the Tekmileh. (TA.)
3
شاكاهُ, inf. n. مُشَاكَاةٌ, He complained of
him, i. q. شَكَاهُ: or he told of his deceit, guile, or
circumvention, and his vices, or faults. (TA.)
4
اشكاهُ [He made him, or caused him, to
complain;] he did to him that which made him,
or caused him, to have need to complain of him.
(S, Msb.) He increased his annoyance and complaining. (Az, K, TA.) ―
-b2-  And He removed, or
did away with, his complaint; or made his complaint to cease; (S, * Mgh, Msb, K;) he caused
him to be pleased or contented [and so relieved
him from his complaint]; syn. أَعْتَبَهُ مِنْ شَكْوَاهُ;
(S, and Har p. 337;) i. e. أَرْضَاهُ; (Har ibid.;) and
he desisted from that of which he complained:
(S, * Msb:) thus it has two contr. significations.
(S, K.) Hence the saying, (Mgh, Msb, TA,) in
a trad., (TA,) إِلَى رَسُولِ اللّٰهِ حَرَّ الرَّمْضَآءِ ↓ شَكَوْنَا
فِى صِيَامِنَا فَلَمْ يُشْكِنَا [We complained, to the
Apostle of God, of the heat of the burning
ground, in our fasting,] and he did not remove,
or cause to cease, our complaint. (Mgh, * Msb,
TA.) And [hence] one says, اشكى فُلَانًا مِنْ فُلَانٍ,
meaning He took for such a one, from such a one,
what pleased or contented him [and so relieved
him from complaining of him]. (ISd, K, TA:
omitted in the CK.) ―
-b3-  Also He told him his
complaint, and the desire, or longing of the soul,
that he endured. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And i. q. وَجَدَهُ شَاكِيًا
[which may mean He found him to be complaining, or, as seems to be indicated by what immediately precedes it in the K, he found him to be
complaining of a disease of the slightest sort]:
(K:) or, as in the T, اشكى [app. meaning اشكى
حَبِيبَهُ] signifies he found the object of his love, or
his friend, to be complaining; expl. by صَادَفَ
حَبِيبَهُ يَشْكُو. (TA.)
-A2-  See also 2.
5
تشكّى He expressed complaint or lamentation, pain, grief, or sorrow; syn. تَوَجَّعَ; (Msb
and K in art. وجع;) he made complaint or
lamentation. (MA, KL.) See 1, in four places.
―
-b2-  [Hence] one says, تشكّى شَآئِى أَرْضَ كَذَا,
meaning (assumed tropical:)  [My sheep or goats] forsook such a
land, [as though they complained of it,] and did
not go near it. (TA. [But I have substituted
شَائِى for what is there written شاكى, an evident
mistranscription.])
-A2-  See also 2, in two places.
6
تَشَاكَوْا They complained, one to another.
(K.)

↓ شَكَاةٌ, and ↓ شَكَآءٌ, and ↓ شَكْوَآءُ, (K,) this last
mentioned by Az, (TA,) [but it is omitted in
some copies of the K,] A complaint, meaning a
disease, malady, or sickness. (K.)
-A2-  Also, the
first, A small, or young, lamb: or a small, or
young, camel: (K accord. to different copies: in
some, الشَّكْوُ having for its explanation الحَمَلُ
الصَّغِيرُ, and thus in the TA: in others, الجَمَلُ
الصغير:) mentioned by ISd. (TA.)
شَكَاةٌ an inf. n. of شَكَا; (S, K;) or a simple
subst., like شَكْوَى. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  See also شَكْوٌ. ―

Also i. q. عَيْبٌ [A vice, fault, &c.]. (TA.) [See
a verse cited voce رِفَاقٌ.]
شَكْوَةٌ The skin of a sucking kid, (T, * S, M, *)
for milk: that of the جَذَع and of such as is
above that [in age] is termed وَطْبٌ; (S;) or that
of the جَذَع is termed سِقَآءٌ; and that of such as is
weaned, بَدْرَةٌ: (T, TA:) or a receptacle of skin

يَشْتَكِى, (S,) or الذى يَشْكُو. (JM.) ―
-b2-  And
Pained; syn. مُوجَعٌ; (K, TA;) in this sense an
instance of فَعِيلٌ in the sense of مَفْعُولٌ: (TA:)
or causing pain; syn. مُوجِعٌ: [thus accord. to
both of my copies of the S: and this appears to
be correct; for it is there immediately added,]
El-Tirimmáh says,
وَسْمِى شَكِىٌّ وَلِسَانِى عَارِمُ
[which is inconsiderately cited in the TA immediately after the former of these two explanations: I say “ inconsiderately ” because the
meaning evidently is, not that thus indicated in
the TA, but, My branding, or stigmatizing, by
satire, (for one says وَسَمَهُ بِالهِجَآءِ,) is such as
causes pain, and my tongue is vehement: or شَكِىٌّ
may here have the last but one of the meanings
expl. in this paragraph]: وَسْمِى is from السِّمَةُ.
(S.) ―
-b3-  Also Affected with a complaint, meaning
disease, malady, or sickness, [app. in an absolute
sense, (see شَكْوٌ,) and also] of the least, or lightest,

-b4-  And
i. q. ↓ مَشْكُوٌّ, (S, Msb, K,) which is a pass. part. n.
of شَكَا; [and therefore signifies Complained of;
and also complained to; but mostly seems to be
used in the former of these senses;] as also

شِكَايَةٌ an inf. n. of شَكَا; (S, K:) or a simple
subst., like شَكْوَى. (Msb.)

-A2-  Also A remainder, or remaining portion, (K and TA in art. شكى,) of a
thing: mentioned by Sgh. (TA.)
شُكَيَّةٌ dim. of شَكْوَةٌ, q. v. (TA.)
شَكِّىٌّ, (thus in copies of the K,) or شُكِّىٌّ, with
damm to the ش, (TA,) is mentioned in art. شك
[q. v.], and J has committed a mistake (K, TA)
in mentioning it here, as Sgh has observed:
(TA:) [accord. to F, it seems to be a rel. n.
applied to a bit, or bridle; for it is said to be so
applied in the K, as well as in the O, in art. شك,
in which both explain it as meaning Difficult;
and also to a skin; for immediately after asserting that J has committed a mistake, F adds,] and
شَكَّى, like حَتَّى, is a town in Armenia, whence
[are brought] bits, or bridles, (لُجُم,) and skins,
(K,) [and SM adds that they are termed شكّيّة:
but what I find J to have stated is as follows:]
الشَّكِىُّ, [thus in one of my copies of the S,] or
الشُكِى, [thus in the other of those copies,] in relation to weapons, is an arabicized word, and is in
Turkish لَش or لَشْ. (S. [But in the JM, this
last word is written, as from the S, تشن: it may
therefore be correctly لَشْن, or لَشِن, which, though
used in Turkish, is a Pers. word, meaning
smooth.])
شَاكٍ: see شَكِىٌّ, in two places.
-A2-  In the phrase
رَجُلٌ شَاكِى السِّلَاحِ, (S,) which means A man
whose weapon is sharp, or whose weapons are
sharp, (S, K, *) Akh says that شاكى is formed
by transposition from شَائِك [q. v. in art. شوك]:
(S:) and accord. to AZ, one says also شَاكٍ فِى
السِّلاحِ. (TA in art. شوك.) ―
-b2-  And الشَّاكِى [is
app. formed in like manner from الشَّائِكُ, and]
signifies The lion. (K.)
مِشْكَاةٌ A niche in a wall; i. e. a hole, or hollow,
(كُوَّةٌ,) in a wall, not extending through; (Fr,
S, M, K, &c.;) in which a lamp, placed therein,
gives more light than it does elsewhere: thus expl:
by the generality of the expositors [of the Kur-án];
and this is said by Ibn-' Ateeyeh to be the most
correct explanation: (TA:) said by Aboo-Moosà to
mean the iron, or leaden, thing in which is the wick
[of the lamp]: thought by Az to mean the tube
which is the place of the wick in the glass lamp,
as being likened to the كُوَّة which is thus called:
(TA:) some expl. it as having this meaning in
the Kur xxiv. 35, and say that the مِصْبَاح there
mentioned is the lighted wick: (Bd:) accord. to
Mujáhid, the pillar, or the like, (العَمُود,) upon
the top, or head, of which the مِصْبَاح [meaning
lamp] is put: or the iron things by means of
which the قِنْدِيل [or lamp] is suspended: IJ says
that its ا is originally و, and hence it is [often]
written مِشْكٰوةٌ: and Zj says that it is an Abyssinian word, and used in the language of the
Arabs: (TA:) [the pl. is مَشَاكٍ, like مَسَاحٍ pl. of
مِسْحَاةٌ:] Kaab says that, in the verse of the Kur
[xxiv. 35], by the مِشْكَاة is meant the breast of
Mohammad; and by the مِصْبَاح, his tongue; and
by the زُجَاجَة, his mouth. (TA.)
مَشْكُوٌّ and مَشْكِىٌّ: see شَكِىٌّ, last sentence.
