شرهشَرِهَ (S, MA, Mgh, Msb, K) عَلَى الطَّعَامِ (MA,
Mgh, Msb) وَغَيْرِهِ, (Msb,) or إِلَى الطَّعَامِ, (TA,
[perhaps a mistranscription,]) aor.
شَرَهَ, (Msb, K,)
inf. n. شَرَهٌ, (S, MA, Mgh, Msb,) said of a man,
(S,) He was vehemently desirous, or greedy;
(MA;) or very vehemently desirous, or very
greedy; (Mgh, Msb;) or overcome by vehement
desire, or greediness; (S, K;) of the food (MA,
Mgh, Msb) &c.: (Msb:) or, as some say, he was
affected with the worst of vehement desire, or of
greediness. (TA.)
شَرِهٌ (S, Msb, K) and ↓ شَرْهَانُ (Lth, K) [Vehemently desirous, or greedy; (see 1;) or] very
vehemently desirous, or very greedy; (Msb;) or
overcome by vehement desire, or greediness: (K:)
or, accord. to some, affected with the worst of vehement desire, or of greediness. (TA.)
شَرْهَانُ: see the next preceding paragraph.
إِهْيَا أَشَرْ إِهْيَا, with kesr to the ء in اهيا, and with
fet-h to the ء in اشر, and to the ش, (K, TA,) and
with the ر quiescent, (TA,) [mentioned in this
art. in consequence of the supposing اشر with اهيا
after it to compose one word,] but this is not its
proper place; (K, TA;) so says Sgh; (TA;) an
ancient Greek expression, (K, TA,) or Syriac,
or, more correctly, Hebrew; (TA;) [the truth is
that it is a mode of writing the Hebrew words
?? “ I shall be that I am,” in
Exod. iii. 14, rendered in our Authorized Version “ I am that I am; ”] said in prayer; (TA;)
[virtually] meaning The existing from eternity,
that will not cease to be: (K:) Sgh says, thus one
of the learned men of the Jews pronounced it to
me in 'Adan Abyan: and some say هيا شراهيا, as
though abridging it, meaning يَا حَىُّ يَا قَيُّومُ
[which may be rendered O Ever-living, O Selfsubsisting by Whom all things subsist; but the
latter epithet is variously explained]; so says
Lth: (TA:) the people now say أَهْيَا شَرَاهِيَا, (so in
some copies of the K,) with fet-h to the ء in اهيا,
and dropping the ء in what follows this word,
[which, however, probably means that they say
أَهْيَا شَرْ أَهْيَا,] or, as in the handwriting of Sgh,
with medd to the ء in the former; (TA;) [in my
MS. copy of the K آهِيَا شَراهيا; in the CK, آهِيًّا
شَراهِيًّا;] which is said in the K to be a mistake
accord. to the assertion of the learned men of the
Jews: but this, which is said to be a mistake, is
what commonly obtains in the books of the
people, [i. e. of the Jews,] and they seldom, or
never, pronounce it otherwise than thus: As says
that the vulgar say يَا هِيَا, which is post-classical;
correctly يَا هَيَاهَ [or يَا هَيَا], with fet-h to the ء:
AHát says, I think it to be originally يَا هَيَا شراهيا
[which is inconsistent with the Hebrew]: and
Ibn-Buzurj says, they said يَا هِيَا and يَا هَيَا in
speaking to one from a near place. (TA.)
