(Ibn-'Abbád,) lacking strength or power or

↓ شَجْعَةٌ: (Lh, K:) the former seems to have the

like سُخْرَةٌ and other words. (Ibn-'Abbád.)
شِجَعَةٌ: see شُجَاعٌ.

شَجَاعٌ: see what next follows.
شُجَاعٌ and ↓ شِجَاعٌ (Lh, ISk, S, Msb, K) and
↓ شَجَاعٌ, (Msb, K,) which is of the dial, of Benoo-
'Okeyl, being made by them to accord with its
contr., which is جَبَانٌ, (Msb,) and ↓ شَجِيعٌ (Lh,
S, Msb, K) and ↓ أَشْجَعُ (S, K) and ↓ شَجِعٌ (K)
and ↓ شِجَعٌ, (as in some copies of the K,) or
↓ شِجَعَةٌ, (as in other copies of the K and in the
TA,) [of all which forms the first is the most
common,] Courageous, brave, valiant, bold,

and [of the first three, and perhaps of the 4th

(Lh, S, K) and (of the 4th, S) شُجْعَانٌ (Lh, ISk,
S, K) [or, accord. to IDrd, شجعان is a mistake,
as is said in the TA, but the word is there written
without any syll. signs,] and (of the 4th, S, Msb)
↓ شُجَعَآءُ (S, Msb, K) and [of the 4th, and perhaps
of others also,] شِجَاعٌ, (K,) and also, (but these
are quasi-pl. ns., TA,) ↓ شَجْعَةٌ (AO, S, K) and
↓ شُجْعَةٌ (K) and ↓ شَجَعَآءُ [app. a mistake
for شِجَعَآءُ or شَجْعَآءُ]: (TA:) pl. fem. [all of
شَجِيعَةٌ, or the last of شَجْعَآءُ or of شَجِعَةٌ,] شَجَائِعُ
and شِجَاعٌ and شُجُعٌ: (Lh, K:) or شُجَاعٌ is [an
epithet] peculiar to men: (K, * TA:) AZ says,
“ I have heard the Kilábees say, رَجُلٌ شُجَاعٌ, but
they do not apply this epithet to a woman: ” (S:)
↓ شَجِعَةٌ and ↓ شَجِيعَةٌ, however, are applied to a
woman, and signify bold, (Ibn-'Abbád, K,) longtongued, and vehemently clamorous, towards men;
(Ibn-'Abbád, TA;) audacious in her speech, (Ibn-
'Abbád, K, [but these two epithets as applied to
a woman and signifying “ bold ” &c. are omitted
in the CK,]) and in her length of tongue, and
vehement clamorousness. (Ibn-'Abbád, TA.) ―
-b2-
شُجَاعٌ (S, Msb, K) and ↓ شِجَاعٌ (K) also signify
(assumed tropical:)  The serpent; (K;) and so does ↓ أَشْجَعُ: (TA:)
or (tropical:)  the male serpent: (Mgh, K:) or a certain
species of serpent, (Sh, S, Msb, K,) as also ↓ أَشْجَعُ,
(S,) small, (K,) or slender, and asserted to be the
boldest of the serpent-kind: (Sh:) pl. شِجْعَانٌ
(Lh, IDrd, K) and شُجْعَانٌ, (IDrd, K,) the former
of which is the more common: (IDrd:) the pl.
of أَشْجَعُ is أَشَاجِعُ; or, as some say, this is pl. of
أَشْجِعَةٌ, which is pl. [of pauc.] of شجاع, signifying the serpent. (TA.) [See also شَجْعَمٌ, above.]
―
-b3-  Also (tropical:)  The serpent called صَفَرٌ, that presents
itself in the belly (S, K, * TA) of a man, as the
Arabs assert, when he has been long hungry: (S,
TA:) but As says that شُجَاعُ البَطْنِ signifies
(assumed tropical:)  vehemence of hunger. (Az, TA.)
شِجَاعٌ: see شُجَاعٌ, in two places.
شَجِيعٌ; fem. with ة: see شُجَاعٌ, in three places.
شَاجِعٌ: see شَجْعَةٌ.
أَشْجَعُ; fem. شَجْعَآءُ: see شُجَاعٌ, in four places.
You say also, لَبُؤَةٌ شَجْعَآءُ A bold lioness. (TA.)
―
-b2-  Applied to a man, accord. to some, it signifies,
(S,) or it signifies also, (K,) In whom is lightness, or unsteadiness, like what is termed هَوَجٌ,
(S, K,) by reason of his strength. (S.) See also
شَجِعٌ. ―
-b3-  Mad; or possessed by a devil: (TA:)
Lth says that, applied to a man, it signifies one
who is as though there were in him madness, or
diabolical possession; but Az says that this is a
mistake; for, were this its meaning, the poets
would not have used it in praise. (TA, in another
part of the art.) ―
-b4-  Tall: (IDrd, Msb, K:) and
so the fem. applied to a woman. (IDrd, Msb.)
―
-b5-  Bulky; big-bodied; or stout: or, as some
say, youthful; or in a state of youthful vigour.
(TA.) ―
-b6-  The lion. (Lth, S, K.) ―
-b7-  It is said in
the K that الأَشْجَعُ also signifies الدَّهْرُ [i. e. Time;
or fortune; &c.]; and J says that this is what the
poet means by the expression, أَشْجَعُ أَخَّاذٌ: but
this cannot be the correct meaning, for the poet,
namely El-Aashà, says,
بِأَشْجَعَ أَخَّاذٍ عَلَى الدَّهْرِ حُكْمُهُ
by الاشجع meaning himself, or some other thing.
(TA.)
-A2-  Also, (S, K,) and إِشْجَعٌ, (K,) or the
latter accord. to some, but this was not known to
Abu-l-Ghowth, (S,) sing. of أَشَاجِعُ, [in some
copies of the S written أَشَاجِيعُ, but the former,
which, as is mentioned in the TA, is found in the
handwriting of J, is that which is commonly
known,] which signifies [The knuckles nearest
to the wrist; this being what is meant by]
the bases (أُصُول) of the fingers, which are
connected with the tendons of the outer side of
the hand: (S, K:) in the T, we find the heads
(رُؤُوس) of the fingers, instead of اصول: (TA:)
or اشجع in the hand and foot [but see what
follows] signifies the tendons extended above the
سُلَامَى [here meaning the metacarpal and metatarsal bones] from the wrist to the bases
(أُصُول) of the fingers or toes, which are called
أَطْنَابُ الأَصَابِعِ, above the outer side of the hand:
or the bone which connects the finger with the
wrist; [i. e. the metacarpal bone;] every finger
having to it a bone thus called: he who says that
the أَشَاجِع [so here instead of اشجع as above]
are the tendons calls those bones the أُسْنَاع.
(TA.) Aboo-Bekr is described as عَارِى الأَشَاجِعِ
عَنْ مَفَاصِلِ الأَصَابِعِ, meaning Having little flesh
upon what are thus termed: or having their
tendons apparent. (TA.) [See also رَاجِبَةٌ and
بُرْجُمَةٌ.]
-A3-  أَشْجَعُ مِنْ دِيكٍ [More courageous
than a cock] is one of the proverbs of the Arabs.
(Mgh.)
مُشْجَعٌ, like مُجْمَلٌ, (K, TA,) i. e. having the
form of a pass. part. n., (TA,) [in the CK مَشْجَع,
like مَحْمَل,] In the utmost state of madness, or
diabolical possession: (K:) so says Ibn-Abbád;
and hence, accord. to him, شُجَاعٌ [but in what
sense he does not say]. (TA.)
مَشْجُوعٌ Overcome, or surpassed, in شَجَاعَة [or
courage, &c.]. (K, TA.)
