شعف1
شَعَفَ, (S, O, K,) aor.
شَعَفَ, (K,) inf. n. شَعَفٌ,
though it is implied in the K, by its being said
that the verb is like مَنَعَ, that it is شَعْفٌ, (TA,)
He smeared, anointed, or overspread, a camel
[suffering from the mange, or scab], with tar,
(S, O, K, and Bd in xii. 30,) and burned him by
so doing. (Bd ibid.) Imra-el-Keys says,
لِيَقْتُلَنِى وَقَدْ شَعَفْتُ فُؤَادَهَا
كَمَا شَعَفَ المَهْنُوْءَةَ الرَّجُلُ الطَّالِى
[That he should slay me, I having overspread her
heart with love of me, like as the man anointing
overspreads her (meaning the camel) that is
smeared with tar]: but it is also related otherwise,
i. e. قَطَرْتُ فُؤَادَهَا كَمَا قَطَرَ: (O, TA:) Aboo-'Alee
El-Kálee says that she [the camel] that is smeared
with tar experiences, by reason of the tar, a
pleasurable sensation with a burning. (TA.) ―
-b2-
Hence, [as indicated above,] قَدْ شَعَفَهَا حُبًّا [He
has overspread and burned her heart with love];
as some read in the Kur xii. 30; others reading
شَغَفَهَا: (Bd:) [or he has burned her heart with
love; for] شَعَفَهُ الحُبُّ means love burned his
heart: (S:) there are two readings of the words
of the Kur above; (O, K;) [as well as two other
readings mentioned in art. شغف;] قَدْ شَعَفَهَا حُبًّا,
(S, O, K,) one, a reading of El-Hasan (S, O) and
others; meaning [as above: or], accord. to AZ,
he has diseased her heart with love, (S, * O,) and
melted it: (O:) or, accord. to El-Hasan, he has
penetrated into her with love: (S:) the other
reading is قَدْ شَعِفَهَا حُبًّا, (O, K,) meaning he has
become attached to her with love, and loved her
excessively: (O:) [but it is also said that] شَعَفَنِى
حُبُّهُ means The love of him overspread my heart
from above; (O, K;) from شَعَفَةٌ signifying the
“ head ” of the heart, “at the place of suspension
of [or from] the نِيَاط; ” (O, * K;) and in like manner, شُعِفْتُ بِهِ and بِحُبِّهِ, (O, and so in the CK,)
or شَعِفْتُ: (so in other copies of the K, in which,
and in the CK, the verb in this case is said to be
like فَرِحَ: [but this I regard as a mistake:]) and
شَعَفَ القَلْبَ He, or it, struck, or smote, the
شَعَفَة, or uppermost part, of the heart: (Ham p.
545:) Az, however, says, I know not any one
that has assigned to the heart a شَعَفَة, except Lth;
and vehement love takes possession of the core
(سَوَاد) of the heart; not of its extremity: [but]
accord. to Fr, شُعِفَ بِفُلَانٍ, like عُنِىَ, means The
love of such a one rose to the highest places of his
heart: others say that الشعف [app. الشَّعَفُ] signifies the being frightened, and disquieted, like the
beast when it is frightened; and that the Arabs
transferred its attribution from beasts to human
beings: (TA:) Abu-l-'Alà says that الشَّعَفُ signifies a thing's falling into the heart: (IB, TA:)
one says also, شَعَفَهُ المَرَضُ Disease melted him:
(TA:) and accord. to AZ, شُعِفَ بِكَذَا means He
became diseased by such a thing. (S.)
شَعَفٌ: see شَعَفَةٌ, in two places. ―
-b2-  Also The
upper, or uppermost, part of the hump of the
camel: (O, K:) Lth says that it is like the heads
of truffles, and the three stones upon which the
cooking-pot is placed, that are round in their
upper, or uppermost, parts. (O.)
-A2-  Also Vehemence of love: (L:) [or simply love: for] one
says, أَلْقَى عَلَيْهِ شَعَفَهُ, meaning [He cast] his love
[upon him, or it]; as also شَغَفَهُ. (TA.)
شَعَفَةٌ The head [or summit] of a mountain:
(S, O, K:) and the upper, or uppermost, part of
anything: (Ham pp. 130 and 545:) pl. ↓ شَعَفٌ
[or rather this is a coll. gen. n., and accord. to
Freytag it is used as a sing., in the two senses
above mentioned, in the Deewán of Jereer,] and
[the pl. is] شُعُوفٌ and شِعَافٌ and شَعَفَاتٌ: (S, O,
K:) and ↓ شَعَفٌ is also expl. as signifying an
elevated part of the earth or ground. (TA.) ―
-b2-
Also A lock of hair (خُصْلَةٌ) upon the head, (K,)
or upon the upper, or uppermost, part of the
head. (O, TA.) And شِعَافٌ (its pl., TA) signifies The hair of the head: so in the phrase رَجُلٌ
صُهْبُ الشِّعَافِ [A man whose hair of the head is
red, or red in the outer part and black beneath,
or of a red colour tinged over with blackness,
&c.]. (S, O, K.) ―
-b3-  And The [pendent lock of
hair termed] ذُؤَابَة of a boy, or young man. (S.)
―
-b4-  And شَعَفَةُ القَلْبِ signifies The head of the
heart, at the place of suspension of [or from] the
نِيَاط [q. v.]. (O, TA. [But see, in the first
paragraph, what Az says respecting this meaning.])
شَعَافٌ, like سَحَابٌ, Love's making away with
the heart. (TA.)
شُعَافٌ Insanity, or madness. (O, K.)
[
شُعَيْفَةٌ dim. of شَعَفَةٌ: pl. شُعَيْفَاتٌ.] One says,
مَا عَلَى رَأْسِهِ إِلَّا شُعَيْفَاتٌ There is not upon his
head aught save some small hairs of the [pendent
lock of hair termed] ذُؤَابَة. (S, O, K.)
مَشْعُوفٌ [Burned in the heart by love: (see 1:)
or] diseased [therein]: (AZ, S:) or struck, or
smitten, in the شَعَفَة of his heart by love, or by
fright, or by insanity, or madness. (O, K.)
Insane, or mad. (O, K.) Bereft of his heart.
(TA.) [See also مَشْغُوفٌ.]
