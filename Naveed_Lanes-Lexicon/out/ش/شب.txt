شبّب النَّارَ, inf. n. تَشْبِيبٌ: see the preceding
paragraph. ―
-b2-  Hence, تَشْبِيبُ الشِّعْرِ (tropical:)  The making
the commencement of poetry elegant, or ornate,
by the mention of women: (L, TA:) or the primary meaning of التَّشْبِيبُ is the mention of the
days of youth and of play or sport, and amatory
language; and it is in the commencing of odes;
and the commencement thereof is so called, absolutely, though there be not in it any mention of
youth: (TA:) it means النَّسِيبُ, (S, O,) or
النَّسِيبُ بِالنِّسَآءِ, (K, TA, [in the CK, erroneously,
التَّشَبُّبُ بالنِساءِ,]) i. e. بِذِكْرِهِنَّ: (TA:) one says,
يُشَبِّبُ بِقُلَانَةَ, (S, O,) and بِهَا ↓ يتشبّب [if this be
not a mistranscription for يُشَبِّبُ], (TA,) meaning
يَنْسِبُ بِهَا: (S, O, TA:) [see this fully expl. in
art. نسب: i. e.] شبّب بِفُلَانَةَ, inf. n. تَشْبِيبٌ,
means, (tropical:)  He spoke of such a female in amatory
language [in the commencement of his ode],
(Msb, TA,) and alluded to the love of her:
(Msb:) and شبّب قَصِيدَتَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He embellished [the
commencement of] his ode by the mention of
women: (Mgh, Msb:) and شبّب قَصِيدَتَهُ بِفُلَانَةَ
(tropical:)  [He embellished the commencement of his ode by
mentioning, in amatory language, such a female]:
(A, TA:) and ↓ شَبَابٌ is used in the sense of
تَشْبِيبٌ; thus a قَصِيدَة is said to be حَسَنَةٌ الشَّبَابِ
(tropical:)  [Beautiful in the mention of women &c.]; and
Jereer is said to have been أَرَقُّ النَّاسِ شَبَابًا (tropical:)  [The
most elegant of men in the mention of women &c.].
(A, TA.) ―
-b3-  Hence, i. e. from تَشْبِيبٌ القَصِيدَةِ, may
be derived التَّشْبِيبُ as a conventional term in the
science of the division of inheritances; meaning
(assumed tropical:)  The mention of daughters according to the
different degrees [of descent]: (Mgh:) it is as
when one says, “he died, and left three daughters
of a son, subordinate one to another, and three
daughters of a son's son, in like manner, and
three daughters of a son's son's son, in like
manner, and the sons died and the daughters
remained. ” (O.) ―
-b4-  تَشْبِيبُ الكُتُبِ signifies (assumed tropical:)  The
commencing of books, or writings: and hence
شَبَّبَ يُجَاوِبُهُ, occurring in a trad., meaning (assumed tropical:)  He
commenced answering him: not from the تَشْبِيب
of women in poetry. (TA.)

him, to become a youth, or young man; i. e.,
to attain to the state termed شَبَابٌ meaning as
expl. below: and اشبّ اللّٰهُ قَرْنَهُ means the same:
(S, A, TA:) the latter [lit. means God made, or
may God make, his equal in age to become a
youth, &c., (see Har p. 572,) and therefore] is
tropical. (A, TA.) ―
-b2-  أَشْبَيْتُ الفَرَسَ I excited the
horse to be brisk, lively, or sprightly, and to raise
his fore legs together, as though in leaping, and
to play. (S, * K, * TA.) ―

to the state of شَبَاب [i. e. youth, or young manhood, &c.]: (K:) [or] أَشَبَّ الرَّجُلُ بَنِينَ (tropical:)  the man
became one whose children had attained to that
state: (S, TA:) and in like manner, أَشَبَّتْ أَوْلَادًا
is said of a woman. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And أَشَبَّ said of
[the species of bovine antelope called] the wild
bull, (S, K,) He became such as is termed شَبَبٌ
[q. v.], i. e., (S,) he became advanced in age, or
full-grown; (مُسِنّ, S, K;) one whose state termed
إِسْنَان [q. v.] had ended. (S.)

تَشَبَّ3َ [تَشَبَّتِ النَّارُ The fire became kindled; or
made to burn, burn up, burn brightly or fiercely,
blaze, or flame: see also 1.] One says on the
occasion of kindling fire,
تَشَبَّبِى تَشَبُّبَ النَّمِيمَهْ
جَآءَتْ بِهَا تَمْرٌ إِلَى تَمِيمَهْ
[Be thou kindled like the state of kindling of the
calumny that Temr brought to Temeemeh: but
to what this alludes I know not]: it is like the
saying, أَوْقَدَ بِالنَّمِيمَةِ نَارًا [He kindled a fire with
calumny]. (A, TA.) ―
-b2-  See also 2.

إِسْتَشْبَ3َ It is said in a trad., يَجُوزُ شَهَادَةُ الصِّبْيَانِ
عَلَى الكِبَارِ يُسْتَثَبُّونَ [The boy's giving testimony
against those that are full grown is allowable,
when they (the former) are deemed to have
attained to the state of youths, or young men]:
it is as though it were said that if they take upon
themselves the bearing witness in boyhood, and
give their testimony when full grown, it is allowable: (TA:) or يُسْتَشَبُّونَ means they shall be
sought youths, such as have attained to puberty,
or maturity, in the case of giving testimony: or
they shall be waited for, in the case of giving
testimony, until the period of becoming youths,
or young men. (Mgh.) ―
-b2-  And it is said in
another trad., اِسْتَشِبُّوا عَلَى أَسْوُقِكُمْ فِى البَوْلِ, i. e.
Sit upon your shanks as one does when preparing
to rise, not stooping with the whole body near to
the ground; [having your feet only upon the
ground; in the voiding of urine:] from شَبَّ
الفَرَسُ meaning “ the horse raised his fore-legs
together from the ground. ” (TA.)
R. Q. 1
شَبْشَبَ He completed [a thing]; (AA,
O, K;) said of a man. (AA, TA.)
شَبٌّ, and its fem. شَبَّةٌ: see شَابٌّ.
-A2-  Also The stones
of زَاج [or vitriol]: (K:) or the stones from which
زاج and the like thereof are obtained; the best
whereof is that which is brought from El-Yemen,
which is white شبّ, and is very glistening: (TA:)
[but شَبٌّ يَمَانِىٌّ, as also شَبٌّ alone, is a name now
commonly given to alum:] or it is a certain
thing resembling زاج: (S, Msb:) or a species
thereof: accord. to El-Fárábee, the stones from
which come زاج and the like: Az says, it is one
of the minerals produced by God in the earth,
with which one tans, and resembling زاج, and the
name [correctly] heard is thus, with ب, but is by
some mistranscribed with the three-dotted ث,
[i. e. شَثٌّ,] which is a kind of tree of bitter taste,
and I know not whether one tans with it or not:
accord. to Mtr, in the saying that one tans with
شبّ, this word is a mistranscription; for شبّ is a
dye, and one does not tan with a dye; it is mistranscribed for شَثّ, which is a kind of tree like
the dwarf apple-tree, whereof the leaves are like
those of the خِلَاف [q. v.], and with them one
tans: El-Fárábee also says, in the section of ث,
that the شَثّ is a species of mountain-tree, with
which one tans: from all which it appears that
one tans with both of them; for an affirmation is
to be preferred to a negation: (Msb:) and it is a
well-known medicine; (K, TA;) as some say:
so accord. to the correct copies of the K, in some of
which, دَآءٌ is put for دَوَآءٌ. (TA.)
شُبّ and دُبّ, though originally verbs, are used
as nouns, by the introduction of مِنْ before them:
one says, أَعْيَيْتَنِى مِنْ شُبَّ إِلَى دُبَّ and مِنْ شُبّ ٍ
إِلَى دُبّ ٍ [expl. in art. دبَ]: (S:) and in like
manner they are used in another saying expl. in
art. دب [q. v.]: (S in that art.:) or, without
tenween, they may be regarded as verbs used in
the way of حِكَايَة [or imitation]. (MF.)
شَبَّةٌ The burning, burning up, burning brightly
or fiercely, blazing, or flaming, of fire. (TA.)
شَبَبٌ and ↓ شَبُوبٌ, applied to a [bovine antelope
of the species called the] wild bull, (As, S, K,)
and to a sheep or goat, (K,) and ↓ مُشِبٌّ, applied
to the former, and ↓ مِشَبٌّ, (As, S, K,) sometimes, applied to the former, (As, S,) or to both,
(K,) Advanced in age, or full-grown, (مُسِنٌّ, S,
K,) whose state termed إِسْنَان [q. v.] has ended;
(As, S;) and ↓ مُشِبَّةٌ is in like manner applied to
a she-camel as meaning مُسِنَّةٌ: (TA:) or ↓ شبُوبٌ,
(AA, K,) applied to both, (K,) as also ↓ مُشِبٌّ,
(TA,) or to a bull, (AA,) is syn. with ↓ شابٌّ
[meaning youthful, or in the prime of life]:
(AA, K, TA:) and accord. to AO, شَبَبٌ, applied
to a bull, means that has attained to the end of
شَبَاب [i. e. youthfulness, or the prime of life]:
(S, TA:) or, as some say, that has attained to
the end of his full growth and strength; as also
↓ شَبُوبٌ, which is likewise applied to the female;
or, accord. to AHát and ISh, when he is a year
old, and weaned, he is called دَبَبٌ; and then,
شَبَبٌ [meaning more than a year old]; and the
female, شَبَبةٌ. (TA.)
شَبَابٌ and ↓ شَبِيبَةٌ [both mentioned above as
inf. ns.] (S, Msb, K) [and ↓ شَبَابِيَّةٌ which is a simple
subst.] Youth, youthfulness, the prime of man-
hood, or young manhood; syn. فَتَآءٌ; (K;) or
حَدَاثَةٌ; contr. of شَيْبٌ: (S:) or the state from
puberty to the completion of thirty years; or
from sixteen years to thirty-two; after which a
man is called كَهْلٌ; (TA;) the age before الكُهُولَة:
(Msb:) or the state between thirty and forty:
(Mgh:) or, accord. to Mohammad Ibn-Habeeb,
the state from the seventeenth year to the completion of fifty-one years is termed ↓ شَبَابِيَّةٌ; the
period before, from birth, being termed غُلُومِيَّةٌ;
and in the period after, a man being called شَيْخٌ,
until he dies. (TA.) One says, سَقَى اللّٰهُ عَصْرَ
↓ الشَبِيبَةِ [May God freshen as with rain the
times, or mornings, or afternoons, of youth, &c.],
and عُصُورَ الشَّبَائِبِ [the times, &c., of the states of
youth, &c.]. (A, TA.) ―
-b2-  [شَبَابٌ often signifies
(assumed tropical:)  The sap, or vigour, of youth or young manhood.]
One says, اِسْتَحَارَ شَبَابُهَا, as in a verse of Aboo-Dhu-eyb, (assumed tropical:)  The sap [or vigour] of youth (مَآءٌ
الشَّبَابِ) flowed in her. (IB, TA in art. حير.) And
اِمْتَلَأَ شَبَابًا (assumed tropical:)  [He became full of the sap, or vigour,
of youth or young manhood]. (The lexicons, &c.,
passim.) [But] مَآءٌ الشَّبَابِ signifies [also] (tropical:)  The
freshness, or brightness, and beauty, of youth.
(Har p. 340.) [And ↓ شَبِيبَةٌ app. signifies also
(assumed tropical:)  Youthful folly, or the like; (see an ex. voce
غَمْرَةٌ;) and so, probably, does شَبَابٌ.] ―
-b3-  [Hence,]
شَبَابٌ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  The first, or beginning, or
the new, or recent, state, of a thing; (K, TA;)
and so ↓ شَبِيبَةٌ. (TA.) One says, قَدِمَ فِى شَبَابِ
الشَّهْرِ (A, TA) (tropical:)  He came, or arrived, in the beginning of the month. (TA.) And لَقِيتُهُ فِى
شَبَابِ النَّهَارِ (A, TA) (tropical:)  I met him in the beginning
of the day: (TA:) and جِئْتُكَ فِى شَبَابِ النَّهَارِ and
بِشَبَابِ النَّهَارِ (assumed tropical:)  I came to thee in the beginning of
the day: (Lh, TA:) or شَبَابُ النَّهَارِ means the
period when the sun has risen high, when one
fifth of the day has passed. (A in art. رأد.) And one
says also ↓ فَعَلَ ذٰلِكَ فِى شَبِيبَتِهِ He did that at
the commencement thereof. (TA.)

-A2-  Also A thing with which a fire is kindled, or

blaze, or flame; (S, K;) and so ↓ شِبَابٌ. (K.)

serves [as a foil] for beautifying, or setting off,
(K,) [or making to appear bright and beautiful,]

thing. (S, K, TA.) So in the saying, هٰذَا شَبُوبٌ
لِكَذَا (tropical:)  This is a thing that serves for increasing,
or enhancing, [or heightening, in beauty,] to such
a thing. (S, TA.) One says of a woman's headcovering, هُوَ شَبُوبٌ لِوَجْهِهَا (tropical:)  [It is a thing that
serves for giving an appearance of additional
brightness and beauty to her face]. (A.)

some of the Arabs say ↓ شُوَابَّةٌ, changing the ى
