like فَضِلَ, aor. يَفْضُلُ, accord. to the lexicologists,

الشَّمْسُ [The sun;] the body of the solar light,
that runs its course in the firmament: (Lth, *
TA:) it is fem.: (S, * Msb, K:) and has neither
dual nor pl.: (Msb:) or it has a pl., [though this
is not used in a pl. sense,] namely, شُمُوسٌ, (S,
K,) as though they called every part of it a شمس,
like as they said مَفَارِقُ for مَفْرِقٌ. (S.) When it
is made determinate without the article ال, [as]
in the name عَبْدُ شَمْسَ, meaning The Servant of
the Sun, (Msb, K,) i. e., of this luminous object,
(Msb,) the شمس of heaven, because they used
to worship it, (K,) it is imperfectly decl., (Aboo-
'Alee, Msb, K,) because it is determinate and of
the fem. gender, (Aboo-'Alee, K,) or because it is
a proper name and of the fem. gender and altered
from الشَّمْس: (Msb:) and a poet says,
كَلَّا وَشَمْسَ لَنَخْضِبَنَّهُمُ دَمًا
[Nay verily, by the sun, we will assuredly dye
them with blood], making شمس imperfectly decl.
because he means the art. ال to be understood:
(IAar, TA:) but some say that in the former
instance, (Msb, TA,) and in the latter, (TA,) the
word in question has a different signification,
which will be shown below: (Msb, TA:) and Sb
says that none of the Arabs made شمس determinate without the art. ال, except in the proper
name mentioned above, in which all of them made
it so. (TA.) The dim. is ↓ شُمَيْسَةٌ. (S, TA.) ―
-b2-
[Also The sun, or sunshine.] You say, قَعَدَ
فِى الشَّمْسِ [He sat in the sun, or sunshine].
(TA.) ―
-b3-  Also, (K, TA,) or شَمْسٌ, (Msb,) A
certain ancient idol. (Msb, K.) Accord. to Ibn-El-Kelbee, it is this that is meant by the proper
name mentioned above; and if so, it is perfectly
decl.: (Msb:) and some say that it is this also
that is meant in the words of the poet cited above,
and that he makes the word imperfectly decl.
because he uses it as a proper name of the image
(الصُّورَة). (TA.)
-A2-  شَمْسٌ also signifies A kind of
necklace or collar: (S, K:) or a pendant, or suspended ornament, (مِعْلَاق,) of the necklace or collar
upon the neck: or the collar of a dog: (TA:) or
a kind of women's ornament: of the masc. gender:
(Lh, TA:) pl. شُمُوسٌ. (TA.) ―

comb, (K,) with which women in the first age
used to comb themselves; (TA;) as also ↓ شَمْسَةٌ.

looking at men, and from exciting their desire:

temper, so that he will not remain still: (TA:
[see 1:]) or that will hardly remain still: (A:)
