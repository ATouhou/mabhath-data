(Msb,) He bound [the horse or] the beast, with

the hind girth; (S;) [i. e.] I put [or extended],
between the hind girth and the fore girth of the
camel, a cord, or string, called شِكَال, and then

(TA in art. حقب.) ―
-b2-  And [hence, i. e.] from
the شِكَال of the beast, (TA,) شَكَلَ الكِتَابَ, (AHát,
S, Msb, K, TA,) inf. n. as above, (Msb, TA,)
(tropical:)  He restricted [the meaning or pronunciation of]
the writing, (قَيَّدَهُ, AHát, S, TA,) or he marked
the writing, (أَعْلَمَهُ, Msb,) with the signs of the
desinential syntax (AHát, * S, * Msb, TA *) [and
the other syllabical signs and the diacritical
points]: or i. q. أَعْجَمَهُ: (K:) but AHát says that
شَكَلَ الكِتَابَ has the former meaning; and أَعْجَمَهُ
signifies he dotted, or pointed, it [with the diacritical points]: (TA:) and الكِتَابَ ↓ اشكل signifies the same as شَكَلَهُ; (S, Msb, K, TA;) as though
[meaning] he removed from it dubiousness and
confusion; (S, K, * TA;) so that the أ in this case
is to denote privation: (TA:) this [J says (TA)]
I have transcribed from a book, without having
heard it. (S.) ―

شَكُلَ; thus correctly, as pointed by IKtt; accord.

مُشَاكَلَةٌ signifies The being conformable,
suitable, agreeable, similar, homogeneous, or congenial; syn. مُوَافَقَةٌ; (S, K;) as also ↓ تَشَاكُلٌ:
(IDrd, S, K:) Er-Rághib [strangely] says that
المُشَاكَلَةُ is from الشَّكْلُ signifying “ the binding,”
or “ shackling,” a beast [with the شِكَال]. (TA.)
You say, هُوَ يُشَاكِلُهُ [He, or it, is conformable,
&c., with him, or it; or resembles him, or it].

by Golius as on the authority of J (whom I do
not find to have mentioned it either in this art. or
elsewhere), and by Freytag as on the authority of
Abu-l-'Alà: accord. to Sh, اشكل in this sense is
from شُكْلَةٌ signifying “ redness mixed with whiteness: ” (see مُشْكِلٌ:) but] accord. to Er-Rághib,
إِشْكَالٌ in a thing, or case, or an affair, is metaphorical, [and] like اِشْتِبَاهٌ from الشِبْهُ. (TA.)
One says, اشكل الأَمْرُ عَلَى الرَّجُلِ (assumed tropical:)  [The thing,
or case, or affair, was, or became, dubious, or
confused, to the man]; and ↓ شَكَلَ means the
same. (Zj, O.) And أَشْكَلَتْ عَلَىَّ الأَخْبَارُ (assumed tropical:)  [The

[meaning There is doubt, or uncertainty, and
there are doubts, or uncertainties, respecting it:
thus using the inf. n. as a simple subst., and therefore pluralizing it]. (Mz, 3rd نوع; &c.) ―
-b3-  It is
also said of a disease; [app. as meaning (assumed tropical:)  It became nearly cured; because still in a somewhat
doubtful state;] like as you say تَمَاثَلَ; and so
↓ شَكَلَ. (TA.) ―
-b4-  اشكل النَّخْلُ The palm-trees
became in that state in which their dates were
sweet (Ks, S, A, O, K) and ripe, (Ks, S, O, Msb,)
or nearly ripe; (A, TA;) and ↓ تشكّل signifies
the same. (O.) ―

had in it what is termed شُكْلَةٌ [q. v.: see also

or phrase or sentence) dubious, or confused.]
شَكْلٌ i. q. شَبَةٌ [as meaning A likeness, resemblance, or semblance; a well-known signification
of the latter word, but one which I do not find
unequivocally assigned to it in its proper art. in any
of the lexicons]. (AA, K, TA. [In the CK, and
in my MS. copy of the K, in the place of الشَّبَهُ as
the first explanation of الشَّكْلُ in the K accord. to
the TA, we find الشِّبْهُ; but that the explanation
which I have given is correct, is shown by what
here follows.]) One says, فِى فُلَانٍ شَكْلٌ مِنْ أَبِيهِ,
meaning شَبَهٌ [i. e. In such a one is a likeness, or
resemblance, of his father]: (AA, TA:) and
مِنْ أَبِيهِ ↓ فِيهِ أَشْكَلَةٌ and ↓ شُكْلَةٌ (AA, O, K, TA)
and ↓ شَاكِلٌ, (O, K, TA,) [likewise] meaning
شَبَهٌ, (AA, O, K, TA,) and مُشَابَهَةٌ: (TK:) and
↓ شَاكِلَةٌ also is syn. with شَكْلٌ [in the sense of
شَبَهٌ]; (K, TA;) [for] one says, هٰذَا عَلَى شَاكِلَةِ
أَبِيهِ as meaning شَبَهِهِ [i. e. This is accordant to
the likeness of his father]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And I. q.
مِثَالٌ: you say, هٰذَا عَلَى شَكْلِ هٰذَا, meaning على
مِثَالِهِ [i. e. This is according to the model, or
pattern, or the mode, or manner, of this]. (TA.)
―
-b3-  And The shape, form, or figure, (صُورَة,) of a
thing; such as is perceived by the senses; and such
as is imagined: (K:) the form (هَيْئَة), of a body,
caused by the entire contents' being included by
one boundary, as in the case of a sphere; or by
several boundaries, as in those bodies that have
several angles or sides, such as have four and such
as have six [&c.]: so says Ibn-El-Kemál: (TA:)
pl. [of pauc., in this and in other senses,] أَشْكَالٌ
and [of mult.] شُكُولٌ. (K.) ―
-b4-  [It often means
A kind, sort, or variety, of animals, plants, food,
&c.] ―
-b5-  [And The likeness, or the way or manner,
of the actions of a person:] it is said in a trad.
respecting the description of the Prophet, سَأَلْتُ
أَبِى عَنْ شَكْلِهِ, meaning [I asked my father
respecting the likeness of his actions, or] respecting
what was like his actions; accord. to IAmb: or,
accord. to Az, respecting his particular way,
course, mode, or manner, of acting, or conduct:
(O:) and ↓ شَاكِلَةٌ [likewise, and more commonly,] signifies a particular way, course, mode,
or manner, of acting, or conduct; (S, O, K, TA;)
as in the saying, كُلٌّ يَعْمَلُ عَلَى شَاكِلَتِهِ, (S, O,
TA,) in the Kur [xvii. 86], (O, TA,) i. e. Every
one does according to his particular way, &c.,
(Ibn-'Arafeh, S, O, Bd, Jel, TA,) that is suitable
to his state in respect of right direction and of
error, or to the essential nature of his soul, and
to his circumstances that are consequent to the
constitution, or temperament, of his body: (Bd:)
and according to his nature, or natural disposition,
(Ibn-'Arafeh, Er-Rághib, O, TA,) by which he is
restricted [as with a شِكَال]: (Er-Rághib, TA:)
and his direction towards which he would go:
(Akh, S, O, K, * TA:) and his side [that he
takes]: (Katádeh, O, K, * TA:) and his aim,
intention, or purpose: (Katádeh, O, K, TA:)
and شَكْلٌ [likewise] signifies aim, intention, or
purpose; syn. قَصْدٌ. (TA.) ―
-b6-  Also A thing that
is suitable to one; or fit, or proper, for one: you
say, هٰذَا مِنْ هَوَاىَ وَمِنْ شَكْلِى [This is of what
is loved by me and of what is suitable to me]:
(K, TA:) and لَيْسَ شَكْلُهُ مِنْ شَكْلِى [What is
suitable to him is not of what is suitable to me].
(TA.) [And hence, app.,] one says, مَاشَكْلِى وَشَكْلُهُ,

me. (T and TA voce أُمٌّ.) ―

المُشَكَّلَة is erroneously put for المُشْكِلَة.])
-A2-  Also
A like; syn. مِثْلٌ; (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K;) and so
↓ شِكْلٌ: (O, K:) or, as some say, the like of
another in nature or constitution: (Msb: [and
accord. to Er-Rághib, it seems that the attribute
properly denoted by it is congruity between two
persons in respect of the way or manner of acting
or conduct: but in the passage in which this is
expressed in the TA, I find erasures and alterations which render it doubtful:]) pl. أَشْكَالٌ (S,
Mgh, O, Msb, K *) and شُكُولٌ [as above]. (S, O,
Msb, K. *) One says, هٰذَا شَكْلُ هٰذَا This is the
like of this. (Msb.) And فُلَانٌ شَكْلُ فُلَانٍ Such
a one is the like of such a one in his several states
or conditions [&c.]. (TA.) In the saying in the
Kur [xxxviii. 58], وَآخَرُ مِنْ شَكْلِهِ, (O, TA,)

their hair, of pearls or of silver. (O.)

colour, (K,) yellow and red. (IAar, O, K.)
-A5-

part, in two places.
-A2-  Also, as an attribute of a
woman, Amorous gesture or behaviour; or such

admixture of a tawny, or brownish, colour], and
شُكْلَةٌ مِنْ سَوَادٍ [an admixture of blackness]:
(TA:) [or] شُكْلَةٌ signifies redness mixed with
whiteness: (Sh, Msb, TA:) in camels, (K, TA,)
and in sheep or goats, (TA,) blackness mixed
with redness, (K, TA,) or with dust-colour: in
the hyena, accord. to IAar, a colour in which are
blackness and an ugly yellowness: (TA:) in the

eye, i. q. شُهْلَةٌ [q. v.]: (K:) or, accord. to AO,

termed شُهْلَةٌ: (S, O, TA:) and the like is in the
eyes of the [hawks, or falcons, termed] صُقُور and
بُزَاة: accord. to some, it is yellowness mixing with

eye of the hawk (الصَّقْر); but he [i. e. AO] says,
I have not heard it used except in relation to
redness, not in relation to yellowness. (TA.)

↓ لَنَا قِبَلَكَ أَشْكَلَةٌ [&c.] i. e. حَاجَةٌ [We have a want
to be supplied to us on thy part; meaning we

from تَحْجِيل, and one hind leg distinguished
thereby: (S, O, K, * TA: *) accord. to A'Obeyd,
it is only in the hind leg; not in the fore leg: (S,
O:) or, accord. to AO, (TA,) having the whiteness of the تَحْجِيل in one hind leg and fore leg,
on the opposite sides, (Mgh, * TA,) whether the
whiteness be little or much: (TA:) [when this is
the case, the horse is said to be ذُو شِكَالٍ مِنْ خِلَافٍ:
see 3 (last sentence) in art. خلف:] the Prophet
disliked what is thus termed in horses. (O.)
شَكِيلٌ (tropical:)  Foam mixed with blood, appearing
