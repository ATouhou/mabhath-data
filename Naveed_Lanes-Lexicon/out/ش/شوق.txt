شَوَّقَ see above, in two places. A poet says, (O,)
a man of the tribe of Kelb, (Ham pp. 145 et seq.,)
وَحَنَّتْ نَاقَتِى طَرَبًا وَشَوْقًا
إِلَى مَنْ بِالحَنِينِ تُشَوِّقِينِى
[And my she-camel uttered a yearning cry, by
reason of lively emotion, and desire; whereupon
I said, For whom, by the yearning cry, dost thou
render me desirous?]: تُشَوِّقِينِى being for تُشَوِّقِينَنِى.
(O, and Ham p. 146, q. v.) Lth says that
التَّشْوِيقُ in relation to reading or recitation [of
the Kur-án], and [sacred] narratives, is as when
one says, شَوِّقْنَا يَا فُلَانُ [lit. Do thou render us
desirous, O such a one], meaning do thou mention [to us] Paradise and what is therein, by
narratives, or reading or recitation; may-be we
shall become desirous of it, and therefore work for
it. (O, TA.)

اشتاق إِلَيْهِ, (MA, O, Msb, K,) and اشتاقهُ,
both signifying the same, (MA, O, K,) as also
إِليه ↓ تشوّق, i. e. He was, or became, desirous of
it; or affected with desire for it; (MA;) [or he
yearned or longed for it in his soul; for] اِشْتِيَاقٌ is
syn. with شَوْقٌ, (q. v.) as expl. below. (S.)
شَوْقٌ Desire, or yearning or longing of the soul,
(S, O, Msb, K,) إِلَى شَىْءٍ for a thing; (S, Msb;)
as also ↓ اِشْتِيَاقٌ: (S:) [or] the motion of love:
(IAar, O, K:) pl. أَشْوَاقٌ. (K.) One says, بَرَّحَ
بِى الشَّوْقُ [Desire, &c., distressed me]: and بَلَغَتْ
مِنِّى الأَشْوَاقُ [meaning in like manner Desires,
&c., distressed me]. (TA.) بَنَاتُ الشَّوْقِ means
(assumed tropical:)  The effects of الشوق [or desire, &c.]. (Ham p.
539.)
-A2-  Also inf. n. of 1 [q. v.]. (Msb, TA.)
شِيقٌ: see what next follows.
شِيَاقٌ (assumed tropical:)  The thing with which a thing is extended
in order to its being tied to a thing; (O, K;) like
نِيَاطٌ; (S in art. شيق, O, TA;) originally. شِوَاقٌ:
and ↓ شِيقٌ, originally شِوْقٌ, signifies the same.
(TA.)
شَائِقٌ Exciting one's desire, or the yearning or
longing of the soul of a person. (S, TA.) ―
-b2-  Also
[a possessive epithet, meaning ذُو شَوْقٍ. And
hence,] An excessive, or attached, or admiring,
lover; syn. عَاشِقٌ; and so ↓ مَشُوقٌ: (Har, p. 142:)
or ↓ the latter signifies one whose desire, or yearning or longing of the soul, is excited: (S, TA:)
the former is sing. of شُوقٌ, (TA,) which is syn.
with عُشَّاقٌ [pl. of عَاشقٌِ] (IAar, O, K, TA) as
well as pl. of أَشْوَقُ. (K.)
شَيِّقٌ i. q. ↓ مُشْتَاقٌ [i. e. Desirous, or yearning
or longing in the soul]: (O, Msb, K:) or i. q.
مَشُوقٌ [q. v. voce شَائِقٌ, in two places]: (JK:)
originally شَيْوِقٌ, of the measure فَيْعِلٌ. (O, TA.)
شَوَّاقٌ [Very desirous; or desiring, or yearning
or longing, in the soul, much]. (JK and Msb
voce تَوَّاقٌ.)
أَشْوَقُ Tall; (IDrd, O, K;) applied to a man;
but not of established authority: (IDrd, O:) pl.
شُوقٌ. (K.)
مَشُوقٌ: see شَائِقٌ, in two places. ―
-b2-  قِرْبَةٌ مَشُوقَةٌ
(tropical:)  A water-skin set up, leaned against a wall.
(Ibn-Buzurj, O, K, TA.)
مُشْتَاقٌ: see شَيِّقٌ. المُشْتَأَق (so in the S,) or
المُشْتَئِق, because مُشْتَاقٌ is originally مُشْتَوِقٌ, of the
measure مُفْتَعِلٌ, (O,) is used by poetic license for
مُشْتَاق, (S, O,) as Sb says; (S;) for the poet,
requiring to make the last letter but one movent,
makes it so by the original vowel. (O.)
