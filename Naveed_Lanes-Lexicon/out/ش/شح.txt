شح1
شَحَّ, (Msb,) sec. pers. شَحَحْتَ, aor. يَشُحُّ
and يَشِحُّ, (S, O, Msb, K,) the latter of these
aors. agreeable with analogy as the verb is
intrans., and the former deviating therefrom;
(MF;) and sec. pers. شَحِحْتَ, aor. يَشَحُّ; (S, O,
Msb, K;) [the first of which, having for its aor.
يَشُحُّ, is the most common;] inf. n. شُحٌّ (S, A, O,
Msb, K) and شِحٌّ and شَحٌّ, (ISk, O, K,) of which
three inf. ns. the first is the most approved; (TA;)
He was, or became, niggardly, tenacious, stingy,
penurious, or avaricious; syn. يَخِلَ: (Msb:) or
بخل relates to single things, or particulars; and
شحّ, to things in general: or بخل relates to

signifies he was, or became, niggardly, &c., as
above, in the utmost degree: (TA:) or he was,
or became, niggardly, &c., as above, (S, A, O,
K,) and covetous, or vehemently or greedily or
excessively or culpably desirous, (K,) or with
covetousness, or vehement or greedy or excessive
or culpable desire. (S, A, O.) You say, شَحَّ بِهِ
and شَحَّ عَلَيْهِ; (T, M, K;) by the former meaning
He was, or became, niggardly, &c., of it, i. e., of
his property, or the like; and by the latter, he
was, or became, niggardly, &c., to him, i. e., to an
asker, or a beggar, or a seeker, or the like:
(MF:) or [in some cases, as will be seen from
phrases mentioned below, (see شَحِيحٌ,)] meaning
by the latter the same as by the former. (L.)
[Thus] one says, هُوَ يَشُحُّ بِمَالِهِ [He is niggardly,
&c., of his property; and sometimes, in the same
sense, يَشُحُّ عَلَى مَالِهِ]. (A.) And شَحَّ بَعْضُهُمْ

&c., as above, with me, of such a thing]. (A.)
[The inf. n.] مُشَاحَّةٌ [in the CK erroneously
written مَشاحَّة] is syn. with ضِنَّةٌ: (K, TA:) hence
the saying, لَا مُشَاحَّةَ فِى الاِصْطِلَاحِ [There shall
be no acting in a niggardly manner, of one with
another, in the making of peace, one with
another]. (TA.) And one says, فُلَانٌ يُشَاحُّ عَلَى
فُلَانٍ Such a one is tenacious of such a one; syn.
يَضَنُّ بِهِ. (S, L.)

(K, TA,) and عَلَيْهِ [for it], (TA,) and vied in
hastening to it, (TA,) fearing lest it should become unattainable. (K, TA.) And تَشَاحَّا عَلَى
الأَمْرِ لَا يُرِيدَانِ أَنْ يَفُوتَهُمَا (S, O, K, TA) They
two (i. e. two men, S, O) contended together for
