Accord. to some, [contr. to the authority of the

(Msb.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] it is said in a prov., فُلَانٌ
يَشُجُّ بِيَدٍ وَيَأْسُو بِأُخْرَى [Such a one breaks a head
with one hand and cures with another]; meaning
(assumed tropical:)  such a one corrupts, or mars, one time, and
rectifies, or repairs, another time. (TA.) And
زَيْدٌ يَشُجُّ مَرَّةً وَيَأْسُو مَرَّةً (tropical:)  Zeyd does, or says,
wrong one time, and right one time. (A, TA.) ―
-b3-

شَجُ3َ and
شَجِ3َ, inf. n.
شَجٌّ, [as above,] (TA,) (tropical:)  He mixed the beverage,
or the wine, (K, TA,) with water. (TA.) Hence,
فَكَانَ يَشُِجُّ عَلَىَّ مِسْكًا, occurring in a trad., means
(tropical:)  And it was as though it mixed with her odour
of musk the breath of wind that reached my
organ of smell. (TA.)

are termed شِجَاج are of ten different kinds, (A,
L,) distinguished by the following epithets: [1]
حَارِصَةٌ, which peels off the [external] skin, but
does not bring blood: [2] دَامِيَةٌ, which brings
blood: [3] بَاضِعَةٌ, [which cleaves the flesh slightly,
and brings blood, but does not make it to flow:
(but in art. دمغ, voce دَامِغَةٌ, q. v., what are here
mentioned as the second and third are transposed:)
4, مُتَلَاحِمَةٌ,] which cleaves the flesh much: [5]
سِمْحَاقٌ, which leaves between it and the bone
only a thin skin: these are five شجاج for which
there is no retaliation nor any determinate mulct,
but respecting which a judge must give his sentence: [6] مُوضِحَةٌ, which reaches to the bone,
and for which the mulct is five camels: [7] هَاشِمَةٌ,
which breaks the bone, and for which the mulct
is ten camels: [8] مُنَقِّلَةٌ, from which bone is removed, from one place to another, and for which
the mulct is fifteen camels: [9] مَأْمُومَةٌ, also
called آمَّةٌ, which leaves between it and the brain
only a thin skin, and for which the mulct is one
third of the whole price of blood: [10] دَامِغَةٌ,
which reaches the brain, and for which the mulct
is also one third of the whole price of blood. (L.)

said to have increased his goodliness]. (MF.)
