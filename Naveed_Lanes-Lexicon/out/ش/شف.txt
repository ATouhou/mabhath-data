شَفَّ, aor.
شَفِ3َ, inf. n. شُفُوفٌ (S, Mgh, O, Msb,
K) and شَفِيفٌ (S, O, K) and شَفَفٌ, (CK, [but
not in my MS. copy of the K nor in the TA,])
It (a garment, or piece of cloth,) was thin, fine,
or delicate, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) so that what
was behind it was visible, (S, * IB, Mgh, [for
خَلَقَهُ in some copies of the S, and خَلْفَهُ in others,
I read مَا خَلْفَهُ, which is the right reading accord.
to IB and the TA, agreeably with the reading in
the Mgh, which is مَا وَرَآءَهُ,]) or so as to tell what
was beneath it: (O, K:) [and it, (a gem, or the
like,) was translucent: or was transparent. (See
شَفَّافٌ.)] One says, شَفَّ عَلَيْهِ ثَوْبُهُ His garment
was thin, &c., upon him. (S.) ―
-b2-  ―
-b3-  And شَفَّ
جِسْمُهُ, aor.
شَفِ3َ, inf. n. شُفُوفٌ, His body became
lean, or emaciated. (S, O, K.)
-A2-  شَفَّ, aor.
شَفِ3َ,
inf. n. شِفٌّ, It (a thing, O, Msb) exceeded; or
was, or became, redundant. (S, O, Msb, K.)
Hence, in a trad., شَفَّ نَحْوًا مِنْ دَانِقٍ It exceeded
by about a دانق. (Sh, O.) And one says, شَفَّ
عَلَيْه, aor. يَشُفُّ, [so in the L and TA, contr. to
rule, probably a mistranscription for يَشِفُّ,] inf. n.
شُفُوفٌ; and ↓ شفّف, and ↓ استشفّ; [app. meaning,
as seems to be indicated by the context, It exceeded it:] and شَفِفْتُ فِى السِّلْعَةِ [app. a mistranscription for شَفَفْتُ] I gained in, or upon, the
the article of merchandise: (TA: [and so, app.,
↓ شَفَّفْتُ: see شَفَّى:]) and فى تِجَارَتِهِ ↓ استشفّ
[He obtained what is termed شِفٌّ in his traffic;
i. e.] he made gain, or profit, in his traffic; syn.
رَبِحَ. (S and K in art. ربح.) ―
-b2-  And sometimes
(Msb) it signifies also the contr.; i. e. It fell
short; or was, or became, deficient. (Msb, K.)
One says, (O, Msb,) of a dirhem, (O,) هٰذَا
يَشِفُّ قَلِيلًا This falls short, or is deficient, a little.
(O, Msb.) And شَفَّ عَنْهُ الثَّوْبُ, aor.
شَفِ3َ, The garment was too short for him. (TA.)
-A3-  Also شَفَّ,
(O, K,) aor.
شَفِ3َ, (O,) It (a thing, O) was, or
became, in a state of motion, commotion, or
agitation. (O, K.)
-A4-  And شَفَّ لَكَ الشَّىْءُ i. q.
دَامَ and ثَبَتَ [app. meaning The thing belonged,
or pertained, to thee permanently, or constantly;
or may the thing belong, &c.]. (TA.)
-A5-  شَفَّهُ,
(S, M, O, K,) aor.
شَفُ3َ, inf. n. شَفٌّ (S, M, TA) and
شُفُوفٌ, (M, TA,) It (anxiety) rendered him lean,
or emaciated; (S, O, K;) as also ↓ شَفْشَفَهُ; (S;)
both are also expl. as meaning it rendered him
lean, or lank in the belly, so that he became
slender: (TA:) or, accord. to the M, it (grief,
and love,) pained his heart: or rendered him
lean, or emaciated: or deprived him of his reason:
and it is said of grief as meaning it manifested
what he felt of impatience. (TA.) And شَفَّ
النُّفُوسَ, as used in a verse of Towbeh Ibn-El-
Homeiyir, It hurt and melted the souls. (Ham
p. 594.)

شَفَّ3َ see the preceding paragraph, in two places.
4
أَشْفَفْتُهُمْ I preferred them, or judged them to
excel. (K.) You say, أَشْفَفْتُ بَعْضَ وَلَدِى عَلَى
بَعْضٍ I preferred some of my children above
some. (S. [And the like is said in the Mgh.])
And أَشْفَفْتُ هٰذَا عَلَى هٰذَا I preferred this above
this. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  And اشفّ فُلَانٌ الدِّرْهَمَ Such a
one made the dirhem to exceed: or, made it to
fall short. (TA.)
-A2-  أَشَفَّ عَلَيْهِ [if not a mistranscription for أُشِفَّ, which I rather think it to
be,] He excelled him, or surpassed him. (TA.)
-A3-  أَشَفَّ الفَمُ The mouth had in it a fetid odour.
(Ibn-Buzurj, TA.)
6
تَشَافَفْتُهُ I took away his or its, شِفّ, i. e.
excess, or redundance. (O, K.) ―
-b2-  See also the
next paragraph, in three places.

اشتفّ مَا فِى الإِنَآءِ (S, O, K) كُلَّهُ (K) He
drank what was in the vessel, all of it, (S, O, K,)
even the شُفَافَة [or last drop or remains], (O,)
not leaving any of it remaining; (S;) [and so
اِجْتَفَّ;] as also ↓ تشافّ: (S, O, K:) and ↓ استشفّ
المَآءَ He drank the water to the uttermost, not
leaving any of it remaining; as also ↓ شَفَّهُ, aor.
شَفُ3َ,
inf. n. شَفٌّ: and المَآءَ ↓ شَفَفْتُ I drank much of
the water without having my thirst satisfied.
(TA.) [Hence,] in the trad. of Umm-Zara,
وَإِنْ شَرِبَ اشْتَفَّ [And if he drank, he drank up
all that was in the vessel]. (S, O.) And it is said
in a prov., ↓ لَيْسَ الرِّىُّ عَنِ التَّشَافِّ (S, O, TA)
i. e. The satisfying of thirst is not from the
drinking up all that is in the vessel; for it is
sometimes effected by less than this: (O, TA:) it
is applied in forbidding one's going to the utmost
in an affair, and persevering therein. (S, * O,
TA.) Accord. to IAar, one says also تَشَافَيْتُ
المَآءَ I exhausted the water; which, ISd says, is
originally ↓ تَشَافَفتُ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  'Abd-Allah Ibn-Sebreh El-Harashee uses the first of these verbs
metaphorically in relation to death; saying,
سَاقَيْتُهُ المَوْتَ حَتَّى اشْتَفَّ آخِرَهُ
meaning (tropical:)  [I vied with him in giving the draught
of death] until he drank the last of it, i. e., the
last of death. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And اشتفّ البَعِيرُ الحِزَامَ
كُلَّهُ means The camel filled, and took up wholly,
the girth, (O, K, TA,) so that nothing remained
of it redundant, by reason of the largeness of the
middle of his body. (TA.)
10
استشفّهُ, (O, K,) or استشفّ مَا وَرَآءَهُ, (S,
Msb,) He saw what was behind it. (O, Msb, K.)
[Thus the former signifies He saw through it:
and it is used in this sense both properly and
tropically.] ―
-b2-  Hence the saying to the seller of
cloths, اِسْتَشِفَّ هٰذَا الثَّوْبَ, [which may be rendered
Look thou through this garment, or piece of
cloth; but is expl. as] meaning make thou this
garment, or piece of cloth, single, [by unfolding
it,] and raise it, or hold it up, in shade, in order
that I may see whether it be close in texture or
flimsy. (TA.) ―
-b3-  استشفّ also signifies [agreeably
with the explanation of استشفّ مَا وَرَآءَهُ mentioned above] (assumed tropical:)  He distinguished a thing plainly,
like as one distinguishes plainly a thing behind
glass. (Har p. 244.) ―
-b4-  And one says, كَتَبْتُ
كِتَابًا فَاسْتَشَفَّهُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  [I wrote a letter, or
writing, &c., and] he examined attentively what
was in it. (TA.)
-A2-  See also 8.
-A3-  And see 1, in
two places.
-A4-  [Freytag mentions as a signification of استشفّ “ Desiderio alicujus rei implevit; ”
with الى before the object: but he names no
authority for this; and I doubt its correctness.]
R. Q. 1
شَفْشَفَهُ: see 1, latter part. ―
-b2-  Also,
accord. to IAar, (O, TA,) inf. n. شَفْشَفَةٌ, (K,
TA,) It (heat, and cold,) dried it up; namely,
a thing, (O, K, TA,) such as herbage, (O, TA,)
&c. (TA.) And accord. to AA, الشَّفْشَفَةُ signifies
The hoar-frost's burning [meaning blasting] the
herbage of the earth: or the burning of a medicament that is sprinkled upon a wound: (O:) or it
has the former of these two meanings, and signifies also the sprinkling of a medicament upon a
wound. (K. [But I think that, for وَذَرُّ الدَّوَآءِ in
the K, we should read وَذَرِّ الدَّوَآءِ, and thus reconcile the K in this case with the O: see, however, what next follows; which may be regarded
either as confirming the reading in the K, or as
having misled its author, in this instance.])
-A2-
الشَّفْشَفَةُ signifies also The sprinkling of urine
and the like. (K.) You say, شَفْشَفَ بِبَوْلِهِ He
sprinkled his urine. (O.)
-A3-  Also The trembling,
and the being confused (الاِخْتِلَاطُ), (O, K, TA,)

towards him, (TA.) [See, again, مُشَفْشَفٌ.])

dry up. (TA.)
شَفٌّ A thin, fine, or delicate, garment or piece
of cloth; (AZ, S, Mgh, O, * Msb, K; *) as also
↓ شِفٌّ (AZ, S, O, Msb, K) and ↓ شَفِيفٌ: (Msb:)
you say ثَوْبٌ شَفٌّ (S, Mgh, Msb) and ↓ شِفٌّ (S,
Msb) and ↓ شَفِيفٌ. (Msb:) [see also شَفَّافٌ:]
and the garment, or piece of cloth, itself, is termed
شَفٌّ and ↓ شِفٌّ: (Har p. 70:) [i. e. each of these
words is also used as a subst.; and this is perhaps
meant in the O and K: or] شَفٌّ signifies also
a certain thin, fine, or delicate, veil or covering:
or, accord. to Aboo-Nasr, a certain thin, fine, or
delicate, veil or covering, of wool, through which
one sees what is behind it: (S:) pl. شُفُوفٌ. (O,
Msb, K.) Among the verses of “ the Book ” [of
Sb, cited as exs. therein], is the following:
لَلْبْسُ عَبَآءَةٍ وَتَقَرُّ عَيْنِى
أَحَبُّ إِلَىَّ مِنْ لُبْسِ الشُّفُوفِ

pleasing to me than the wearing of thin, fine, or
delicate, garments]. (O.)

-A3-
شفّ [app. شَفٌّ] also signifies Pimples, or small

شِفٌّ: see شَفٌّ, in three places.
-A2-  Also, (S,

is that which is well known, (L, TA,) and
↓ شَفِيفٌ, (TA,) Gain, or profit; increase obtained in traffic: and excess, surplus, or redundance: syn. رِبْحٌ [q. v.] : and فَضْلٌ; (S, Mgh, O,
K;) and زِيَادَةٌ. (Mgh, TA.) Hence (Mgh)
نَهَى عَنْ شِفِّ مَا لَم يُضْمَنْ, meaning [He (the
Prophet, TA) forbade] the رِبْح [i. e. gain, or
profit, of that for which one has not made himself responsible to the purchaser]. (O, Mgh.)
And one says, لِهٰذَا عَلَى هٰذَا شِفّق [There is, or
pertains, to this, an excess above this]. (Ksh in
ii. 15.) And قَالَ قَوْلًا شِفًّا He said a saying that
was a redundance. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And A deficiency:
thus having two contr. meanings. (ISk and S
and O in explanation of the first word, K in explanation of the first and second words, and TA
in explanation of all.) ―
-b3-  Also, the first word,
i. q. مَهْنَأٌ: one says to a person when regarding
him with a wish for the like of a thing that he
has attained, or that he possesses, without desiring

شَفِيفٌ: see شَفٌّ, in two places:
-A2-  and see
شِفٌّ.
-A3-  Also Cold, as a subst.; (ISk, S, O, Msb;)
thus in the saying, وَجَدَ فِى أَسْنَانِهِ شَفِيفًا [He felt,
or experienced, in his teeth, cold]; (S, O;) and
so ↓ شَفَّانٌ: (ISk, Msb:) or, as some say, (O,)
the hurting, or paining, (لَذْع, [in the CK لَدْغ,]
of cold: (S, O, K:) and intense cold, with rain

cold [alone]: (Msb:) or a cold wind in which is
moisture: (O:) and ↓ شَفَّانٌ signifies the cold of a

شَفِيفٌ A cold and moist wind, having [much]
cold and moisture, made him to betake himself to
a covert: (IDrd, IF, Msb:) or شَفِيفٌ signifies
rain and hail: (O:) or so ↓ شَفَّانٌ; [or rain and
cold: for برد is written in my original without
any syll. sign;] wherefore some of the lawyers
say that it is rain and more: (Msb:) or شَفِيفٌ
signifies also rain in which is hail: (K, TA:) or
rain in which is cold: (CK:) or a cold wind;
(K;) as also ↓ شَفْشَافٌ: (O, K:) or this last signifies a wind of mild cold: (S, TA:) and ↓ شَفَّانٌ,
cold and wind: (O, K:) one says, غَدَاةٌ ذَاتُ شَفَّانٍ

moisture. (S.) ―
