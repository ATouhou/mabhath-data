شيأ1
شَآءَهُ, (Msb,) [originally شَيِئَهُ,] like خَافَهُ,
[which is originally خَوِفَهُ,] (MF,) first. pers.
شِئْتُهُ, (S, K,) aor. يَشَاؤُهُ, (Msb,) [and by poetic
license يَشَاهُ, without ء,] first pers. أَشَاؤُهُ, (S. K,)
inf. n. شَىْءٌ (Msb, K) and مَشِيْئَةٌ, (S, * K,) or this
is a simple subst., (Msb,) and مَشَآءَةٌ and مَشَائِيَةٌ,
(K,) [or these two also are simple substs.,] He,
and I, willed, wished, or desired, it; syn. أَرَادَهُ
(Msb) and أَرَدْتُهُ: (S, * K:) most of the scholastic
theologians make no difference between المَشِيْئَةُ
and الإِرَادَةُ, though they are [said to be] originally
different; for the former, in the proper language,
signifies the causing to be or exist, syn. الإِيجَادُ;
and the latter, the willing, wishing, or desiring;
syn. الطَّلَبُ. (TA.) A Jew objected, to the
Prophet, his people's saying مَا شَآءَ اللّٰهُ وَشِئْتُ
[What God hath willed and I have willed], as
implying the association of another being with
God: therefore the Prophet ordered them to say
مَا شَآءَ اللّٰهُ ثُمَّ شِئْتُ [What God hath willed, then I
have willed]. (TA.) [مَا شَآءَ اللّٰهُ as signifying
What hath God willed! is used to express admiration. And as signifying What God willed
it is a phrase often used to denote a vague,
generally a great or considerable, but sometimes
a small, number or quantity or time: See De
Sacy's Relation de l'Égypte par Abdallatif, pp.
246 and 394 &c.]

شَيَّأْتُهُ عَلَى الأَمْرِ [in some copies of the K
(erroneously) شِئْتُهُ] I incited him, or made him,
to do the thing, or affair. (As, S, L, K, TA.)
-A2-
And شَيَّأَ اللّٰهُ وَجْهَهُ, (K, TA,) and خَلْقَهُ, (TA,)
God rendered, or may God render, foul, unseemly, or ugly, his face, (K, TA,) and his make.
(TA.)
4
أَشَآءَهُ إِلَيْهِ He, or it, compelled him, constrained him, or necessitated him, to have recourse,
or betake himself, to it; syn. أَلْجَأَهُ; (S, K;) a
dial. var. of أَجَآءَهُ; (S;) of the dial. of Temeem.
(TA.) Temeem say, شَرٌّ مَا يُشِيؤُكَ إِلَى مُخَّةِ عُرْقُوبٍ,
meaning يُجِيؤُكَ [q. v., i. e. It is an evil thing
that compels thee to have recourse to the marrow
of a hock]. (S.)
5
تشيّأ His anger became appeased: (K:)
said of a man. (TA.)
شَىْءٌ [A thing; anything; something; somewhat;] a word of well-known meaning: (K:)
[sometimes, in poetry, written and pronounced
شَىٌّ: see an ex. in a verse cited voce صُؤَابَةٌ: see also
the last sentence but one of this paragraph:] الشَّىْءُ
properly signifies what may be known, and that
whereof a thing may be predicated: (Mgh, KT:)
accord. to Sb, it denotes existence, and is a name
for anything that has been made to have being,
whether an accident, or attribute, or a substance,
and such that it may be known, and that a thing
may be predicated thereof: (KT:) MF says that
it is app. an inf. n. used in the sense of a pass.
part. n., meaning what is willed, and meant, or
intended, [in which sense ↓ مَشِيْئَةٌ (pl. مَشِيْآتٌ) is
often used,] without restriction to its actuality or
possibility of being, so that it applies to that which
necessarily is, and that which may be, and that
which cannot be; accord. to the opinion adopted
by the author of the Ksh: [or, as an inf. n. in the
sense of a pass. part. n., it may be expl., agreeably
with what is said to be the proper meaning of the
verb, as signifying what is caused to be or exist;
accordingly,] Er-Rághib says that it denotes whatever is caused to be or exist, whether sensibly, as
material substances, or ideally, as sayings; and
Bd and others expressly assert that it signifies
peculiarly what is caused to be or exist; but Sb
says that it is the most general of general terms;
and some of the scholastic theologians apply it to
what is non-existent; such, however, are overcome in their argument by its not being found to
have been thus used by the Arabs, and by such
passages as كُلُّ شَىْءٍ هَالِكٌ إِلَّا وَجْهَهُ [Everything
is subject to perish except Himself (Kur xxviii.
last verse)] and وَإِنْ مِنْ شَىْءٍ إِلَّا يُسَبِّحُ بِحَمْدِهِ
[And there is not anything but it glorifies Him
with praising (Kur xvii. 46)], for what is nonexistent cannot be described as perishing nor
imagined to glorify God: (TA:) the pl. is أَشْيَآءُ,
(S, Msb, K, &c.,) imperfectly decl., (Msb, TA,)
or rather this is a quasi-pl. n., (Sb, TA,) respecting
the formation of which there is much difference
of opinion [as will be shown hereafter], (Msb,
TA,) and أَشْيَاوَاتٌ, (S, K,) a pl. pl. [i. e. pl. of
أَشْيَآءٌ], (MF, TA,) and أَشَاوَاتٌ, [a contraction of
that next preceding,] (K,) and أَشَاوَى, (S, K,)
with fet-h to the و, (MF, TA,) and it is also
mentioned as with kesr, (TA,) [and is written in
both of my copies of the S أَشَاوَى, though if with
kesr it should be either أَشَاوٍ or أَشَاوِىُّ, but أَشَاوَى
only is meant by J, as is shown by what here
follows,] originally أَشَايِىُّ, with three ى s, not
أَشَائِىُّ as J says, [or rather as the word is written
in copies of the S, for J may have held it to be
أَشَائِىُّ or أَشَايِىْءُ, as he says that the ء was changed
into ى thus occasioning the combination of three
ىs, so that he held its secondary form to be
أَشَايِىُّ, as will presently be shown,] because the
first ى is radical, not augmentative, (IB, K,) the
medial ى of the three being suppressed, and the
final one changed into ا [though written ى], and
the initial one changed into و, (S,) and another
form of pl. is أَشَايَا, (S, Msb, K,) with the ى
preserved, not changed into و [as it is in أَشَاوَى],
(TA,) [likewise] a pl. of أَشْيَآءُ, (Msb,) and أَشَيَايَا
also is mentioned, (K,) as formed [from أَشْيَآءُ] by
the change of ء into ى and adding ا, (TA,) and
أَشَاوِهُ, which is strange, (Lh, K,) as there is no ه
in أَشَيَآءُ, (Lh,) or in شَىْءٌ: (K:) with respect to
the first of these forms, [the quasi-pl. n.] أَشَيَآءُ, the
most probable opinion is that of Kh: (Msb,
TA:) accord. to him, (S, Msb, K,) it is originally
of the measure فَعْلَآءُ, (S, K, *) in lieu of أَفْعَالٌ,
(K,) and therefore imperfectly decl., (S,) [i. e.] it
is originally شَيْئَآءُ, (Msb,) and the two hemzehs
combined in the latter portion being found
difficult of pronunciation, the former of them is
transposed to the beginning of the word, so that
it becomes of the measure لَفْعَآءُ, (S, Msb,) as is
shown by its having for its pls. أَشَاوَى and أَشَايَا
and أَشْيَاوَاتٌ: (S:) accord. to Akh, it is [originally] of the measure أَفْعِلَآءُ; (S, K;) but if it were
thus a broken pl., [not a quasi-pl. n.,] its dim.
would not be ↓ أُشْيَّآءُ, as it is, but شُيَيْآتٌ: (S:)
accord. to Ks, it is of the measure أَفْعَالٌ, and
made imperfectly decl. because of frequency of
usage, being likened to فَعْلَآءُ; but were it so, أَبْنَآء
and أَسْمَآء would be imperfectly decl.: (S, K:)
accord. to Fr, شَىْءٌ is originally شَيِّئٌ, and therefore has a pl. of the measure أَفْعِلَآءُ, afterwards
contracted to فَعْلَآءُ; but were it so, it would not
have for its pl. أَشَاوَى. (S. [Much more respecting
this pl. is added in the TA, but it is comparatively
unprofitable.]) The dim. of شَىْءٌ is ↓ شُيَىْءٌ and
↓ شِيَىْءٌ; (S, K, TA, but only the former in some
copies of the K, the word being written in other
copies شُِيَىْءٌ;) not ↓ شُوَىٌّ, or ↓ شُوَىْءٌ; (the former
accord. to my two copies of the S and accord. to
the copies of the K followed in the TA, in which
it is said to be with teshdeed to the ى, and the
latter accord. to the CK and my MS. copy of the
K;) or this is a dial. var. of weak authority, (K,)
used by post-classical poets in their verses. (MF,
TA.) ―
-b2-  When a man says to thee, “What dost
thou desire? ” thou answerest, لَا شَيْئًا [Nothing]:
and when he says, “Why didst thou that? ” thou
answerest, لِلَا شَىْءٍ [For nothing]: and when he
says, “What is thine affair? ” thou answerest,
لَا شَىْءٌ [Nothing]: it is with tenween in every
one of these cases. (As, AHát, TA.) [When one
says لَا شَىْءَ, he means thereby There is nothing.]
―
-b3-  لَيْسَ بِشَىْءٍ means [It is nought, of no account
or weight; it is not worthy of notice, or not worth
anything;] it is not a good thing; or it is not a
thing to be regarded. (W p. 27.) ―
-b4-  [لَيْسَ مِنَ الأَمْرِ
فِى شَىْءٍ is a phrase of frequent occurrence, meaning He has no concern with the affair; see two
exs. in the first paragraph of art. حوص. ―
-b5-
فِيهِ شَىْءٍِ مِنَ الطُّولِ occurs in the TA voce حُسْبَانَةٌ,
meaning In it is somewhat, or some degree, of
length; i. e. it is somewhat long; and is used in
the present day in this sense.] ―
-b6-  In the phrase
هُوَ أَحْسَنُ مِنْكَ شَيْئًا, the last word is for بِشَىْءٍ
[i. e. He is better than thou in something; meaning he is somewhat better than thou]. (IJ, L.) ―
-b7-
مَا أَغْفَلَهُ عَنْكَ شَيْئًا is a phrase of the Arabs [app.
lit. signifying How unmindful of thee is he as to
anything!] mentioned by Sb as meaning دَعِ الشَّكَّ
عَنْكَ [Dismiss doubt from thee (respecting him
as to anything)]: IJ says that شيئا is here put in
the accus. case as an inf. n., as though the saying
were مَا أَغْفَلَهُ عَنْكَ غُفُولًا, because the verb of
wonder does not require to be corroborated by the
inf. n. [proper to it]: (L, TA:) [or it is a specificative:] IF says that it is a phrase of dubious
meaning; and that the most probable explanation
of it is this; that ما is here lit. interrogative, but
in meaning denotative of wonder; and that شيئا is
governed in the accus. case by some other word,
or phrase, as though the saying were dismiss a
thing by which he is not occupied in mind, and
dismiss doubt as to his being occupied in mind by
it. (TA in art. ما.) ―
-b8-  [شَيْئًا فَشَيْئًا means Thing
by thing, part by part, bit by bit, piecemeal, inch
by inch, drop by drop, little and little in succession, by little and little, by degrees or gradually.] ―
-b9-  أَىُّ شَىْءٍ [meaning What thing?] is,
by the alleviation of the ى [in اىّ] and the suppression of the ء [in شىء], made into one word,
أَيْشَىْ: so says El-Fárábee: (Msb:) or, [as is
commonly the case in the present day,] by reason
of frequency of usage, it is contracted into أَيْشَ.
(TA in art. جرم, as on the authority of Ks.) ―
-b10-
شَىْءٌ in the Kur lx. 11 may mean Any one (Bd,
Jel) or more. (Jel.) ―
-b11-  [It is also applied to
(assumed tropical:)  The penis of a man; as in the explanation of a
phrase mentioned voce ذَنَبٌ; like as its syn. هَنٌ
is to the same and (more commonly) to the
“ vulva ” of a woman.] ―
-b12-  In algebra, it signifies
[A square root;] a number that is multiplied into
itself; which in arithmetic [and in algebra also] is
called جذر [i. e. جَذْرٌ]; and in geometry, ضلع
[i. e. ضِلْعٌ or ضِلَعٌ]; (“ Dict. of the Techn. Terms
used in the Sciences of the Musalmans,” p. 202;)
an unknown number that is multiplied into itself.
(Idem, p. 730.)
-A2-  It is also said, on the authority
of Lth, to signify Water: and he cites as an ex.,
تَرَى رَكْبَهُ بِالشَّىْءِ فِى وَسْطِ قَفْرَةٍ
[Thou seest, or wilt see, his company of riders at
the water in the midst of a desert]: but AM says,
I know not الشىء in the sense of “ water,” nor
know I what it is. (TA.)
-A3-  يَا شَىْءَ is an expression of regret, (El-Ahmar, Ks, TA,) or of
wonder, (K, TA,) [or of both,] meaning [Oh! or]
O my wonder! (Ks, Lh, TA.) One says, يَا شَىْءَ
مَا لِى, (El-Ahmar, Ks, Lh, K,) and يَا شَىَّ مَا لِى,
i. e. with and without ء, (Ks, TA,) and يَا هَىْءَ مَا
لِى, (Lh, K,) يا هَىَّ ما لى, and يَا فَىَّ ما لى,
(El-Ahmar, Ks, TA,) neither of these two with
ء, (Ks, TA,) [meaning Oh! or O my wonder!
What has happened to me?] in all of these, (Ks,
TA,) ما being in the place of a noun in the nom.
case. (Ks, Lh, TA.) ―
-b2-  Some also say, يَا شَىْءَ
and يَا هَىَّ and يَا فَىَّ, and some add مَا, saying,
يَا شَىْءَ مَا and يَا هَىَّ مَا and يَا فَىَّ مَا, meaning
How good, or beautiful, is this! (Ks, TA.)
شِيْئَةٌ [Will, wish, or desire,] a subst. from شَآءَهُ,
(Lh, K,) [and] so is ↓ مَشِيْئَةٌ [which is mentioned
in the K as an inf. n.]. (Msb.) One says, كُلُّ
شَىْءٍ بِشِيْئَةِ اللّٰهِ, (S, K,) i. e. ↓ بَمِشِيْئَتِهِ [Everything
is by the will of God]. (S.)
