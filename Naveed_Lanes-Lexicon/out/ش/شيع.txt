follow you: (O, K:) or, not quit you: (K:)

followed by [the fasting of] six [days] of Showwál expl. by أَتْبَعْتُهُ بِهَا [a well-known phrase, of
frequent occurrence, but one which I have not
found in any of the lexicons, except in explanations; the approved phrase used in its stead being
أَتْبَعْتُهُ إِيَّاهَا, lit. meaning “ I made them to follow
it; ” this being virtually the same as “ I made it to be

it, and is expl. as there meaning المُفَاخَرَةُ بِكَثْرَةِ
