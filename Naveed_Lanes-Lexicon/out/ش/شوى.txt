wound would occasion death; (S, Msb, K;) and
so ↓ شَوَاهُ, as in the Tekmileh: in the K, erroneously, شوّاهُ. (TA.) ―

شَاةٌ: see what next follows: and see more in
art. شوه.
شِيَةٌ i. q. شَآءٌ [q. v. in art. شوه]; as also ↓ شَوِىٌّ;
(IAar, K;) the latter is like غَنِىٌّ, [الشَّوٰى in the
CK as syn. with الشّاءُ being a mistranscription,]
and is said by IAth to be a quasi-pl. n., or [what
lexicographers term] a pl., of ↓ شَاةٌ [n. un. of
شَآءٌ]. (TA.)
شِىٌّ is originally شِوْىٌ. (ISd, TA.) One says,
جَآءَ بِالعِىِّ وَالشِّىِّ, (S, K,) using the latter noun as
an imitative sequent to the former [for the purpose
of corroboration: see art. عى]. (TA.)
شَوًى is pl. of شَوَاةٌ: [or rather the former is a
coll. gen. n. of which the latter is the n. un.:] the
latter signifies The skin of the head: (S, TA:) so
[accord. to some] in the Kur lxx. 16: (TA:) or
the exterior of the skin of the head, in which
grows the hair: (Aboo-Safwán, TA in art. بشر:)
and some say, the exterior of all, or of any part,
of the skin: (TA in the present art.:) and the
former signifies the arms or hands and the legs
or feet, or the fore and hind legs, (S, K,) and (K)
the extremities (Msb, K) collectively, (K,) and
the head of a human being, (S,) or the قِحْف of
the head [i. e. the bone above the brain, or a
separate portion of the skull, or a distinct bone of
the skull], (K,) but of a horse the legs, not the
head, because one says عَبْلُ الشَّوَى [i. e. thick in
the legs], for this cannot relate to the head of the
horse, (S,) and any part that is not a [vital]
place [i. e.] where a wound causes death (S, Msb,
K) such [for instance] as the legs. (Msb.)
ثَالِبَةُ الشَّوَى means A woman having cracked, or
chapped, feet. (S and K in art. ثلب.) ―
-b2-  It is
also a subst. [app. meaning a quasi-inf. n.] from
أَشْوَاهُ [q. v.] as said of a shooter or caster: (TA:)
[and hence] the saying (S, TA) of the Hudhalee,
(S, [accord. to the TA, Khálid Ibn-Zuheyr,])
فَإِنَّ مِنَ القَوْلِ الَّتِى لَا شَوَى لَهَا
إِذَا زَلَّ ظَهْرِ اللِّسَانِ انْفِلَاتُهُ
means (assumed tropical:)  [And, or for] verily of speech is that
sentence (كَلِمَة, a word understood,) which does
not hit a place where a wound will not occasion
death, [i. e. which does not miss its object, when
its escaping from the upper surface of the tongue
is quick,] but which kills. (S, TA.) And شَوًى
is used [app. in like manner, as a quasi-inf. n.,]
in the case of anything that has missed an object
of aim, though there be to it [really] no place
where a wound would occasion death nor anything that is [properly] termed شَوًى [as meaning
a place where a wound will not occasion death].
(TA.) And [hence] it signifies (assumed tropical:)  A mistake; syn.
خَطَأٌ. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Also (tropical:)  A thing, (S,) or an affair,
(K,) that is paltry, mean, despicable, or of no
account or weight or worth: (S, K, * TA:) in
this sense, from the same word as signifying the
“ extremities ” [of an animal]. (IAth, TA.) Hence,
in a trad. of Mujáhid, كُلُّ مَا أَصَابَ الصَّائِمَ شَوًى
إِلَّا الغَيْبَةَ (tropical:)  [Everything that befalls the faster
is a matter of no account, except absence of mind];
i. e. nothing that befalls the faster annuls his fast
except الغيبة, for this does annul it. (TA.) ―
-b4-
And (assumed tropical:)  The worse, or viler, sort of cattle, (S, K,
TA,) of camels, and of sheep or goats; and the
small, or young, thereof. (TA.) [See also شُوَايَةٌ.]
―
-b5-  And (assumed tropical:)  A remainder, or remaining portion.
(TA.) [See, again, شُوَايَةٌ.] ―
-b6-  Also i. q. إِبْقَآءٌ
(assumed tropical:)  [The making, or causing, or suffering, to remain; or, perhaps, to continue in life, and if it
mean thus, it may be from the same word in a
sense expl. above, for the animal that one hits in
a part that is not vital is suffered to continue in
life]. (TA.)
شُوَآءٌ: see what next follows.
شِوَآءٌ Roasted, broiled, or fried, flesh-meat; (S, *
MA, Msb, K, * KL;) as also ↓ شُوَآءٌ; (Ks, Sgh,
K;) but the former is more usual and more
chaste: (TA:) a subst. from شَوَى اللَّحْمَ: and
↓ شِوَآءَةٌ [as its n. un.] signifies a piece thereof. (S.)
شَوِىٌّ (K) and ↓ مَشْوِىٌّ (Msb) [Roasted,
broiled, or fried], the latter originally مَشْوُوىٌ.
(Msb.) [In the K the former is said to be like
شِوَآءٌ; but it has the signification of the latter, i. e.,
of a pass. part. n.]
-A2-  See also شِيَةٌ.
-A3-  Ks says,
(S,) in the phrase عَيِىٌّ شَيِىٌّ, and so in عَيِىٌّ شَوِىٌّ,
(S, K,) some say (S) the latter word is an
imitative sequent to the former [i. e. a corroborative: see art. عى]. (S, K.)

large; as a piece, or detached portion, of a sheep,
or goat: one says, مَا بَقِىَ مِنَ الشَّاةِ إِلَّا شُوَايَةٌ
[There remained not of the sheep, or goat, save a
piece]. (S.) ―
-b3-  Also, (S, K,) and ↓ شِوَايَةٌ and
↓ شَوَايَةٌ, (K,) A قُرْص [or round cake, or small
round cake,] of bread. (S, K.) ―
-b4-  And, all the
three, A remaining portion of people, or of cattle,
that have perished; as also ↓ شَوِيَّةٌ; (K;) or this

[See also شَوًى.] ―
-b5-  And (tropical:)  The bad, or vile, sort,
(K, TA,) or worse, or viler, sort, (TA,) of camels,
and of sheep, or goats: (K, TA:) in this sense
written by ISd with kesr and with fet-h. (TA.)
[See, again, شَوًى.] ―
-b6-  [And accord. to Freytag,
شواية الرضف (i. e. شوايةُ الرَّضْفِ) is expl. by Meyd
as meaning Cooked milk cast upon a hot stone, so
that only a small portion remains.]
