not changed from ج because it remains ى in the
dim., in which, where it so changed, it should be
changed back into ج, whereas the dim. of شِيَرَةٌ is

was a شَمُرَة [or gum-acacia-tree]: (TA:) and by

in art. صخر, q. v.) ―
-b4-  By الشَّجَرَةُ الطَّيِّبَةُ, mentioned in the Kur in xiv. 29, is said to be meant
The palm-tree: or a certain tree in Paradise:

the colocynth, and the كَشُوث: [see art. خبث:]

(so in my copy of the A, and accord. to the CK,)
or ضرعها ↓ شَجْرَةَ, (O, and so accord. to the text
of the K as given in the TA, [but Z has, in the
A, distinguished the phrase as tropical, and hence
it seems that he held the former reading to be
the right,]) (tropical:)  How goodly are the shape, (A,) or
the size, (O, K,) and the appearance, of her
udder! (A, O, K:) or the veins and skin and
flesh thereof! referring to a she-camel. (O, K.)
