شهد1
شَهِدَ, (S, A, Mgh, L, Msb, K,) aor.
شَهَدَ; (K;)
and شَهُدَ, aor.
شَهُدَ; (K;) also pronounced and written
شَهْدَ, (Akh, S, K,) and شِهْدَ, and شِهِدَ, accord. to
a rule applying to all verbs of the measure فَعِلَ of
which the medial radical letter is a faucial; (MF;)
inf. n. شَهَادَةٌ (S, A, Mgh, L, Msb, K) and شهد;
(TA;) [there written without any syll. sign, and
not found by me in any other Lex.;]) He told, or
gave information of, what he had witnessed, or
seen or beheld with his eye: (Mgh, L, Msb:) this
is the primary signification: (L:) he declared
what he knew: he gave testimony, attestation, or
evidence; he bore witness: (L:) he gave decisive
information. (S, A, L, K.) [See also شَهَادَةٌ below.] You say, شَهِدَ بِكَذَا, inf. n. as above, (S,
A, Mgh, L, Msb, K,) He told, or gave information of, such a thing, as having witnessed it, or
seen or beheld it with his eye; (Mgh, Msb;) or
declared such a thing as knowing it; (L;) or
gave his testimony, attestation, or evidence, respecting it; or bore witness of it, or to it; (S, A,
L, K;) عِنْدَ الحَاكِمِ [in the presence of the judge];
لِفُلَانٍ [for, or in favour of, such a one], (S,
Mgh, L, K,) and عَلَى فُلَانٍ [against, or in opposition to, such a one]. (Mgh.) And شَهِدَ عَلَى
كَذَا He gave decisive information [respecting
such a thing (as in the Kur xlvi. 9, and in many
other instances); he testified respecting it]. (S,
L. [See also another meaning of this phrase in
what follows.]) [Hence,] شَهِدَ اللّٰهُ أَنَّهُ لَا إِلَاهَ إِلَّا هُوَ,
in the Kur [iii. 16], means God hath given
evidence that there is no deity but He: (Abu-l-
'Abbás, IAmb, Jel:) or God knoweth &c.; (Ah-
mad Ibn-Yahyà, K;) and so شَهِدَ اللّٰهُ throughout
the Kur-án: (Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà:) or God saith
&c.: or God hath written &c. (K.) And أَشْهَدُ
أَنْ لَا إِلَاهَ إِلَّااللّٰهُ I know, (Msb, K,) [or acknowledge,] and I declare, [or testify, that there is no
deity but God:] (K:) [Fei says,] the verb is
trans. in this phrase by itself [i. e. without the
intervention of a prep.] because it is used in the
sense of أَعْلَمُ. (Msb.) [And hence, كَلِمَةُ الشَّهَادَةِ
means The sentence declaring that there is no
deity but God and that Mohammad is God's
apostle.] ―
-b2-  شَهِدَ بِاللّٰهِ, (Mgh, * Msb,) aor.
شَهَدَ, inf. n.
شَهَادَةٌ, (Mgh,) means He swore by God: (Mgh,
Msb:) and أَشْهَدُ بِكَذَا I swear by such a thing.
(S, K.) أَشْهَدُ بِاللّٰهِ لَقَدْ كَانَ كَذَا I swear by God
that such a thing happened, or took place, combines the meaning of witnessing with that of
swearing and that of informing at the time of
uttering these words; as though the speaker said,
I swear by God that I witnessed such a thing,
and now I inform of it. (Msb.) Accord. to
some, when one says only أَشْهَدُ, not adding بِاللّٰهِ,
it is an oath. (TA.) ―
-b3-  شَهِدَ عَلَى كَذَا, a phrase
of which one meaning has been expl. above,
means also He became a witness (شَاهِد) of, or to,
such a thing; (S, K;) he had knowledge of such
a thing, and witnessed it, or saw it or beheld it
with his eye: (Msb:) and شَهِدَهُ, (Mgh, L,) inf. n.
شَهَادَةٌ, (L,) [likewise] signifies he witnessed it;
or saw, or beheld, it, or him, with his eye; (Mgh,
L;) and (Mgh, L, Msb) so ↓ شاهدهُ, (A, Mgh, L,
Msb, K,) inf. n. مُشَاهَدَةٌ. (S, A, L, Msb.) [Hence,]
one says, مِنْهُ حَالٌ جَمِيلَةٌ ↓ شُوهِدَتْ [A comely, or
pleasing, state, or condition, of him was witnessed]. (A.) ―
-b4-  And شَهِدَهُ, (aor.
شَهَدَ, K,) inf. n.
شُهُودٌ, He was, or became, present at it, or in it;
(S, A, Mgh, L, Msb, * K;) namely, a place,
(Mgh,) or an assembly. (Msb.) Hence the
saying, (Msb,) فَمَنْ شَهِدَ مِنْكُمُ الشَّهْرَ فَلْيَصُمْهُ, in the
Kur [ii. 181], Therefore whosoever of you shall
be present in the month, and stationary, not
journeying, he shall fast therein (Mgh, Msb) as
long as he shall remain present and stationary:
(Msb:) الشهر being here in the accus. case as an
adv. n. of time. (Mgh, Msb.) [And hence,]
شَهِدَ الجُمْعَةَ He attained to [the being present at]
the جُمْعَة [here meaning, as in many other instances, the prayer of Friday]: (Mgh:) and
شَهِدَ العِيدَ he attained to [the being present at] the
عِيد [or festival, or the prayer thereof]. (Msb.)
[Hence also,] it is said in a trad., يَشْهَدُ بَيْعَكُمُ
الحَلِفُ وَاللَّغْوُ [Swearing, and unprofitable speech,
attend your selling]. (TA in art. شوب: see 1 in
that art.)

أَشْهَدْتُهُ عَلَى كَذَا I made him to be a witness (شَاهِد) of, or to such a thing: (S, Mgh, L:)
[and in like manner,] أَشْهَدْتُهُ الشَّىْءَ I made him
to have knowledge of the thing, and to witness it,
or see it or behold it with his eye. (Msb.) See
also 10. إِشْهَادٌ in relation to criminal matters
means [The causing one to take notice of a thing
that threatens to occasion some injury, with a
view to the prevention of such injury; as, for
instance,] the saying to the owner of a house,
“ This thy wall is leaning, therefore demolish it,”
or “ feared, therefore repair it. ” (Mgh.) ―
-b2-
اشهدهُ also signifies He caused him to be present.
(K.) You say, أَشْهَدَنِى إِمْلَاكَهُ He caused me
to be present [at, or on the occasion of, his being
put in possession]. (S.) ―
-b3-  أُشْهِدَ: see 10.
-A2-
اشهد [as intrans.] (assumed tropical:)  Humorem tenuem e pene
emisit vir propter lusum amatorium vel osculum;
(S, K;) as also ↓ شهّد, (K,) inf. n. تَشْهِيدٌ: (TA:)
[from شَهْدٌ signifying “ honey; ” for] عُسَيْلَةٌ is a
term for مَذْىٌ. (S.) (assumed tropical:)  He rendered his مِئْزَر [or
waist-wrapper] of a reddish hue and of a dark
dust-colour (أَخْضَر) [by the act above-mentioned].
(L.) (assumed tropical:)  He (a boy) attained to puberty. (Th,
TA.) And اشهدت She (a girl) menstruated:
and attained to puberty. (K.)
5
التَّشَهُّدُ in prayer is well known; (S, K;)
The reciting of the form of words commencing
with التَّحِيَّاتُ لِلّٰهِ: [see art. حى:] from the occurrence therein of the words أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلَاهَ إِلَّا اللّٰهُ
وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ. (Mgh, * TA. [See
also Har p. 611.]) ―
-b2-  And تَشَهَّدَ also signifies He
sought, or desired to obtain, martyrdom. (L.)
10
استشهدهُ He asked him, or required him,
to tell what he had witnessed, or seen or beheld
with his eye; to declare what he knew; to give
testimony, or evidence; to bear witness; or to
give decisive information. (S, Mgh, L, Msb, K.)
You say, اِسْتَشْهَدْتُ فُلَانًا عَلَى فُلَانٍ I asked, or
required, [or cited, or summoned,] such a one to
give his testimony, or evidence, or to bear witness,
against such a one. (L.) And اِسْتَشْهَدْتُ الرَّجُلَ
عَلَى إِقْرَارِ الغَرِيمِ and ↓ أَشْهَدْتُهُ I asked, or required, [&c., and made,] the man to bear witness
to, or to be witness of or to, the confession, or
acknowledgment, of the debtor. (L.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,]
استشهد بِبَيْتٍ عَلَى مَعْنَى كَلِمَةٍ [He adduced, or
urged, or cited, a verse as an evidential example
of the meaning of a word]. (A phrase of frequent
occurrence in the larger lexicons.) ―
-b3-  اُسْتُشْهِدَ (S,
K) and ↓ أُشْهِدَ (K) He was slain a martyr in the
cause of God's religion. (S, K. [See شَهِيدٌ.])
شَهْدٌ: see شَاهِدٌ, first sentence.
-A2-  Also, and
↓ شُهْدٌ, (S, Msb, K,) the former of the dial. of
Temeem, and the latter of the people of El-'Áliyeh,
(Msb, TA,) Honey: (K:) or honey in its wax
[i. e. its comb]; (S, Msb;) honey not expressed
from its wax [or comb]: (TA:) pl. شِهَادٌ: (S,
Msb, K:) شَهْدَةٌ is a more particular term, (S,
K,) the n. un., [signifying a portion thereof; and
a honey-comb, or a portion of a honey-comb;] as
also شُهْدَةٌ. (TA.)
شُهْدٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
شُهُودٌ: see شَاهِدٌ, in two places.
شَهِيدٌ is also written and pronounced شِهِيدٌ, with
kesr to the ش: (K, TA:) and in like manner is
every word of the measure فَعِيلٌ having a faucial
letter for its, medial radical, whether an epithet,
like this, or a subst., like رَغِيفٌ and بَعِيرٌ: ElHemdánee says, in the “ Iaráb el-Kur-án,” that
the people of El-Hijáz, and Benoo-Asad, say
رَحِيمٌ and رَغِيفٌ and بَعِيرٌ, with fet-h to the first
letter; and Keys and Rabee'ah and Temeem say
رَحِيمٌ and رِغِيفٌ and بِعِيرٌ, with kesr to the first
letter: Sub says, in the R, that Temeem pronounce every فَعِيل of which the medial radical
letter is hemzeh or any other faucial with kesr to
the first letter: and En-Nawawee states, on the
authority of Lth, that some of the Arabs do the
same when the medial radical letter is not a faucial; as in كبير and كريم and جليل and the
like thereof. (TA.) [This last pronunciation obtains extensively in the present day: and so, in
similar cases, does the intermediate pronunciation
termed إِمَالَةُ الفَتْحِ, (i. e. the pronouncing fet-h
like “ e ” in the English word “ bed,”) which
may be justly regarded as the best to be followed
because intermediate and because sanctioned by
the usage of the classical times, except in cases
that are pointed out by the grammarians as presenting obstacles to the pronunciation thus termed.]
―
-b2-  شَهِيدٌ is syn. with شَاهِدٌ [in several senses, as
shown below]: and its pl. is شُهَدَآءُ. (S, K.) See
شَاهِدٌ, in six places. ―
-b3-  Also Possessing much
knowledge with respect to external things: خَبِيرٌ
is used in the like sense with respect to internal
things; and عَلِيمٌ, in the like sense absolutely.
(L.) [Hence, perhaps,] وَادْعُوا شُهَدآءَكُمْ, in the
Kur ii. 21, [as though meaning And call ye to
your aid those of you who possess much knowledge: or] the meaning here is, your helpers:
(Bd:) or your gods whom ye worship. (Jel.)
الشَّهِيدُ as a name of God means The Faithful, or
Trusty, in his testimony (Zj, L,) or in testimony:
(K:) and (Zj, K) as some say, (Zj,) He from
whose knowledge nothing is hidden; the Omniscient. (Zj, L, K.) ―
-b4-  Also, derived from الشَّهَادَةُ,
or from المُشَاهَدَةُ, or from الشُّهُودُ, [all inf. ns.,]

measure فَعِيلٌ in the sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ;
(Msb, TA;) or in the sense of the measure فَاعِلٌ;

(IAth:) so called because the angels of mercy are
present with him; (K;) because the angels are
present at the washing of his corpse, or at the
removal of his soul to Paradise: (Msb:) or because God and his angels are witnesses for him of
his title to a place in Paradise: (IAmb, Mgh, *
K:) or because he is one of those who shall be
required to bear witness on the day of resurrection, (K, TA,) with the Prophet, (TA,) against
the people of past times, (K, TA,) who charged
their prophets with falsehood: (TA:) or because
of his falling upon the ↓ شَاهِدَة, or ground: (K:)
or because he is still living, and present with his
Lord: (ISh, Mgh, K:) or because he witnesses.
or beholds, God's world of spirits and his world
of corporeal beings: (K, * TA:) [and several other
reasons are assigned for this appellation:] the
primary application is that expl. above: but it is
also applied by the Prophet to one who dies of
colic: one who is drowned: one who is burned to
death: one who is killed by a building falling to
ruin upon him: one who dies of pleurisy: (IAth,
L:) one who dies of plague, or pestilence: a
woman who dies in a state of pregnancy: (L:)

(A, Msb, K, &c.)
شَهَادَةٌ [see 1:] Information of what one has
witnessed, or seen or beheld with his eye: (IF,
Mgh, L, Msb:) this is the primary signification:

information. (S, A, L, K.) ―
-b2-  An oath: pl.
شَهَادَاتٌ: so in the Kur xxiv. 6 [and 8]. (TA.)
―
-b3-  Martyrdom in the cause of God's religion.
(S, K. [See شَهِيدٌ.]) ―
-b4-  Also i. q. مَشْهَدٌ as expl.
below: see the latter word. ―
-b5-  [And it is used in
the sense of مُشَاهَدٌ: thus,]وَالشَّهَادَة الغَيْبِ عَالِمُ , in
the Kur vi. 73 &c., means The Knower of what is
unseen and of what is seen. (Jel.)
شَهِيدَةٌ A roasted lamb: or [the kind of food
called] هَرِيسَة [q. v.]: pl. شِهَادٌ. (Har. p. 609.)
[
شَهَّادٌ Always present. (Freytag from the Deewán of the Hudhalees.)]
شَاهِدٌ (S, Mgh, L, K) and ↓ شَهِيدٌ (S, * Mgh, L)

S, K,) or [rather] this is a quasi-pl. n., (Sb, TA,)
like as صَحْبٌ is of صَاحِبٌ, and سَفْرٌ of سَافِرٌ, (S,)
but some disallow this; (TA;) and ↓ شُهُودٌ [but
see what is said of this in the latter half of the
paragraph] and أَشْهَادٌ are also pls. of شَاهِدٌ, (Mgh,
L,) or of شَهْدٌ: (S, K:) the pl. of ↓ شَهِيدٌ is شُهَدَآءُ.
(S, Mgh.) [Hence,] ↓ مَعَهَا سَائِقٌ وَشَهِيدٌ, in the
Kur 1. 20: see art. سوق. ―
-b2-  [Hence also] الشَّاهِدُ
a name of the Prophet; (K;) meaning The
witness against those to whom he has been sent.
(Jel in xxxiii. 44.) ―
-b3-  And شَاهِدٌ An angel: (S,
L, K:) or a guardian angel: (Mujáhid:) pl.
أَشْهَادٌ: or this means the prophets. (TA.) ―
-b4-
And The tongue: (S, L, K:) from the saying,
لِفُلَانٍ شَاهِدٌ حَسَنٌ Such a one has an elegant
diction. (L.) One says also, مَا لِفُلَانٍ رُوَآءٌ وَلَا شَاهِدٌ
Such a one has neither goodliness of aspect nor
tongue. (Aboo-Bekr, L.) ―
-b5-  [As a conventional
term used in lexicology &c.,] An evidential
example, generally poetical, of the form or meaning
of a word or phrase: pl. شَوَاهِدُ: the sciences that
require شَوَاهِد being those of اللُّغَة and الصَّرْف and
النَّحْو and المَعَانِى and البَيَان and البَدِيع and
العَرُوض and القَوَافِى. (MF on the خُطْبَة of the
K.) [One says, هٰذَا شَاهِدٌ لِكَذَا and عَلَى كَذَا
This is an evidential example of such a thing.]
With respect to the classical language, absolutely,
شواهد are taken, by universal consent, from the
Kur-án, and from the language [both verse and
prose (Kull p. 348)] of those Arabs who lived
before the period of the corruption [in any considerable degree] of the Arabic tongue: [see
مُوَلَّدٌ:] also, accord. to the general decision of the
learned, from the Traditions of Mohammad;
[which last source is excluded by some because
traditions may be corrupted in language by their
transmitters, and interpolated, and even forged;]
and electively from the language of those Arabs
who lived after the first corruption of the Arabic
tongue, but before the corruption had become extensive. (Mz, 1st نوع; and MF ubi suprà. [See,
again, مُوَلَّدٌ.]) The classes of the poets from
whose poetry شواهد are taken are the Pagan
Arabs, the Mukhadrams, the Islámees, and the
Muwelleds: [see جَاهِلِىٌّ and مُخَضْرَمٌ and إِسْلَامِىٌّ
and مُوَلَّدٌ:] with respect to all the sciences above
mentioned, they are taken from the poetry of the
first, second, and third, classes; from that of the
first and second by universal consent, and from
that of the third electively: (MF ubi suprá:) but
they are taken from the poetry of the fourth class
with respect only to the sciences of المَعَانِى and
البَيَان and البَدِيع. (Idem, and Kull p. 348.)
[The age of the earliest existing classical poems
(though some older fragments and couplets and
single verses have been preserved) is only about
a century before the birth of Mohammad: that of
the latest, about a century after his death. (See
the Preface to this work.)] ―
-b6-  Knowing,

with his eye; a witness, as meaning an eyewitness; (L, Msb;) as also ↓ شَهِيدٌ: pl. of the
former [or, as is said in the L in art. مجد, of the

this paragraph;] and of the latter شُهَدَآءُ. (Msb.)

as also ↓ شَهِيدٌ: (Msb:) pl. of the former شُهَّدٌ (S,

this last is used as a pl. but is originally an inf. n.

meaning The present knows what the absent knows
not. (Msb.) And قَوْمٌ شُهُودٌ People, or persons,
present. (S, A.) And كَلَّمْتُهُ عَلَى رُؤُوسِ الأَشْهَادِ
[I spoke to him before witnesses, or persons
present]. (A.) ―
-b9-  [Hence, app., being opposed
to غَائِبٌ,] A running in which a horse exerts his
force unsparingly; (A, L;) as in the saying,
لِلْفَرَسِ غَائِبٌ وَشَاهِدٌ The horse has a run which he
reserves [for the time of need], and a run which
he performs unsparingly; like the saying, لَهُ
صَوْنٌ وَبَذْلٌ: (A: [see 1 in art. بذل:]) or شَاهِدٌ
means a running that testifies the excellence of a
horse, (IAar, K,) and his quality of outstripping
others. (IAar, TA.) ―
-b10-  A star [app. when visible]; (Aboo-Eiyoob, K;) as being present and
apparent in the night. (TA.) ―
-b11-  [Hence, accord.
to some,] صَلَاةُ الشَّاهِدِ The prayer of sunset; (A,
L, Msb, K;) because it is the prayer that is performed when the star becomes visible; (Sh, L;)
also called صَلَاةُ البَصَرِ, because the stars are seen
at the time thereof: or, accord. to some, the
prayer of daybreak; (L;) [and so, accord. to
some, صَلَاةُ البَصَرِ; (see art. بصر;)] as also ↓ المَشْهُودُ;
(TA;) and it is said to be so called because he
who is travelling must perform it without
abridging it, like him who is present at his home:
Aboo-Sa'eed Ed-Dareer says that the former
prayer is so called for this reason [as is also said
in the A and Msb]: AM asserts that the first
reason assigned above is the right one, because
the prayer of daybreak, in like manner, may not
be abridged, and is not thus called; but it is thus
called by a poet. (L.) ―
-b12-  And الشَّاهِدُ is a name
of Friday; (Fr, K;) as also ↓ المَشْهُودُ: or the
latter is the day of resurrection: (K:) or the
day of 'Arafeh: (Fr, K: [see عَرَفَةُ:]) because of
the presence and congregation of people on each
of those days. (TA.) ―
-b13-  شَاهِدٌ also signifies
Matter resembling mucus, that comes forth with

to ISd, means the أَغْرَاس [pl. of غِرْسٌ, q. v.,] upon

inhabitants of heaven and earth will be present.
(TA.) And صَلَاةٌ مَشْهُودَةٌ مَكْتُوبَةٌ A prayer at the
