شوب1
شَابَهُ, aor. يَشُوبُهُ, (S, A, Msb,) inf. n. شَوْبٌ
(S, A, Msb, K) and شِيَابٌ, (K,) He mixed it;
(S, A, Msb, K;) such as milk with water; (Msb;)
or honey with water. (A.) [And It mingled
with it: for] one says also, كَأَنَّ رِيقَتَهَا خَمْرٌ يَشُوبُهَا
عَسَلٌ [As though her saliva were wine with which
honey mingled]. (A.) ―
-b2-  [It is sometimes used
in a good sense, but more frequently in a bad
sense; and often means He adulterated, vitiated,
or sophisticated, it.] It is said in a trad., يَشْهَدُ
بَيْعَكُمُ الحَلِفُ وَاللَّغْوُ فَشُوبُوهُ بِالصَّدَقَةِ (assumed tropical:)  [Swearing,
and unprofitable speech, attend your selling;
therefore mix ye it with alms]. (TA.) And it is
said in a prov., هُوَ يَشُوبُ وَيَرُوبُ (assumed tropical:)  He mixes, or
confounds, or makes a confusion or disorder, in
speech and in actions: (S, TA:) or he says right
one time and wrong another time: (As, TA:) or
he defends without energy: (TA:) or he is sometimes incited to motion, or action, and defends
himself, but without energy, and sometimes he is
motionless, and does not become excited to motion,
or action; and it is not from [the words شَوْبٌ and
رَوْبٌ applied to] milk: so says Aboo-Sa'eed [i. e.
As]: and he says also that شَابَ عَنْهُ وَرَابَ means
he defended him at one time, and was sluggish, or
indolent, at another time: and that عنه ↓ شوّب,
inf. n. تَشْوِيبٌ, means he defended him without
energy: and thus this latter is expl. in the K, as
is likewise شاب عنه: also that the Arabs say,
لَقِيتُ فُلَانًا اليَوْمَ يَشُوبُ عَنْ أَصْحَابِهِ, meaning I
found such a one to-day defending his companions
in some measure. (TA.) [See also art. روب.] ―
-b3-
شاب also signifies He acted treacherously, perfidiously, or unfaithfully: (Fr, TA:) he lied:
he deceived in selling or buying: and he acted
dishonestly, insincerely, or with dissimulation.
(IAar, TA.) ―
-b4-  [See also Har p. 448; where it is
implied that it signifies also He spoke truth, or
was veracious.]

شَوَّبَ see the preceding paragraph.

إِنْشَوَبَ see what next follows.
8
إِشْتَوَبَ اشتاب It was, or became, mixed; (O, K;)
as also ↓ انشاب. (K.)
شَوْبٌ inf. n. of 1 [q. v.]. (S, A, &c.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,]
لَا شَوْبَ وَلَا رَوْبَ, occurring in a trad., means
There is, or shall be, no dishonesty, insincerity, or
dissimulation, nor mixing, in the selling, or
buying: so says IAar: or I am irresponsible with
respect to this commodity: or, as he is related to
have said, thou art irresponsible for its being
faulty, or defective. (TA. [See also شَوْبَةٌ.]) ―
-b3-
And شَوْبٌ (TA) and ↓ شِيَابٌ, (S, TA,) [each an
inf. n. used as a subst. properly so termed,] or
↓ شِيَابَةٌ, (so in one copy of the S,) signify A
mixture; an admixture; or a thing mixed with
another thing. (S, TA.) Thus شَوْبًا signifies in
the Kur xxxvii. 65: (TA:) or, accord. to one
reading, the word there is ↓ شُوبًا, meaning a thing
with which another thing is mixed. (Bd.) الشَّوْبُ
also signifies [particularly] What is mixed [with
something else], of water or of milk: (K:) one
says, سَقَاهُ الذَّوْبَ بِالشَّوْبِ He gave him to drink
honey with water, or milk, mixed [therewith]:
(TA:) or سَقَاهُ الشَّوْبَ بِالذَّوْبِ He gave him to
drink milk [mixed] with honey. (IDrd, TA.)
And Mixed honey; as in the saying, مَا عِنْدِى
شَوْبٌ وَلَا رَوْبٌ I have not mixed honey nor milk
such as is termed رَائِب [q. v.]: (IAar, TA:) or
[simply] honey &c.; (A, Msb, TA;) so called because they mix it with beverages; (Msb;) as in the
saying, سَقَاهُ الشَّوْبَ بِالرَّوْبِ He gave him to drink
honey with clarified butter, or with milk. (A.)
And Broth; as in the saying, مَا عِنْدَهُ شَوْبٌ وَلَا رَوْبٌ
He has not broth nor milk. (S, K: but in the
latter, مَا لَهُ.) And شَوْبٌ signifies also A piece of
dough. (K.) ―
-b4-  And [the pl.] أَشْوَابٌ signifies
(assumed tropical:)  A medley, or mixed multitude, of sundry sorts:
a less particular term than أَوْبَاشٌ, which signifies
a medley, or mixed multitude, of the low, or
lower, or lowest, sort: (TA, from a trad.:) accord.
to El-Jawáleekee, it is an arabicized word, from
the Pers. آشُوبٌ. (TA in art. وشب.)
شُوبٌ: see شُوبًا in the next preceding paragraph.
شَوْبَةٌ Deceit, delusion, guile, or circumvention:
(K: [see also شَوْبٌ:]) [or, app., somewhat thereof:] one says, فِى فُلَانٍ شَوْبَةٌ [In such a one is
deceit, &c.]. (TA.)
شَيْبَآءُ A virgin in the night of her devirgination: (Ibn-Abi-l-Hadeed, MF:) [either from
شَابَ having for its aor. يَشُوبُ, signifying “ he
mixed,” or from شَابَ having for its aor. يَشِيبُ,
signifying “ he became white-headed, or hoary; ”
as shown by what follows:] one says, بَاتَتْ
بِلَيْلَةِ شَيْبَآءَ, (S and A in art. شيب, and K in the
present art.,) and بِلَيْلَةِ الشَّيْبَآءِ, (K,) She passed
the night of a virgin then devirginated, (S, A,
K,) and of the virgin then devirginated: (K,
TA:) said of a virgin-bride when she is devirginated by the bridegroom in the night in which
she has been first brought to him: (A, K, TA:)
in the contr. case, when she is not devirginated,
one says, بَاتَتْ بِلَيْلَةِ حُرَّةٍ: (S, TA:) and one says
also, بِلَيْلَةٍ شَيْبَآءَ and بِلَيْلَةٍ حُرَّةٍ: (TA in art. حر:)
Z, in the A, mentions the first phrase in art. شيب,
and makes it to be tropical, as though the bride
were in that night afflicted by an event so severe
as to cause the locks of her hair to become white:
in the L it is said that the ى in شيباء is substituted
for و, because of [the allusion of the phrase to]
the mixing of the sperma genitale of the man with
that of the woman; but that ٰشَوْبَآء has not been
heard instead of شيباء: ISd, in the M, mentions it
in arts. شوب and شيب; observing that the ى is
said to take the place of و: J, as well as Z and
others, mentions it in art. شيب [q. v.]. (TA.)
شِيَابٌ and شِيَابَةٌ: see شَوْبٌ.
شَائِبَةٌ sing. of شَوَائِبُ meaning The whiteness
[mixing] with the darkness of night. (Har p.
58.) ―
-b2-  The saying لَيْسَ فِيهِ شَائِبَةُ مُلْكٍ may be
from شَابَهُ “ he mixed it; ” meaning There is not
in it anything [of ownership, or right of possession,] mixed therewith, though small, or however
small; like as one says, لَيْسَ فِيهِ عُلْقَةٌ وَلَا شُبْهَةٌ; it
being an instance of the measure فَاعِلَةٌ in the
sense of the measure مَفْعُولَةٌ, as in عِيشَةٌ رَاضِيَةٌ:
thus the lawyers use it. (Msb.) ―
-b3-  شَائِبَةٌ is also
sing. of شَوَائِبُ meaning Uncleannesses, filths, or
pollutions; or unclean, filthy, or foul, things. (S,
Msb, K. *)
مَشُوبٌ (S, Msb) and مَشِيبٌ, the latter from شِيب
[“ it was mixed ”], Mixed. (S, Msb.) A poet
says, (namely, Suleyk Ibn-Es-Sulakeh EsSaadee, TA,)
وَمَآءُ قُدُورٍ فِى القِصَاعِ مَشِيبُ
i. e. [And the water of cooking-pots, in the
wooden bowls,] mixed with seeds for seasoning and
with sauces. (S.) ―
-b2-  الفَتْحَةُ المَشُوبَةُ بِالكَسْرَةِ means
[The fet-hah that is mingled with kesreh; which
is] the fethah that precedes the ا of إِمَالَة; as in
عَابِدٌ and عَارِفٌ [when they are pronounced
“ 'ébidun ” and “ 'érifun ”]; for امالة consists in
inclining [the sound of] fet-hah towards [that of]
kesreh; whereby [the sound of] the ا that follows
it is inclined, and is not a pure ا; for like as [the
sound of] the fet-hah is mingled [with that of
kesreh], so is [the sound of] the ا [mingled with
that of ى]. (L, TA.)
مُشَاوَبٌ, with damm [to the م], and fet-h to the
و, [not with both of these vowels to the و as
supposed by Freytag,] The case (غِلَاف) of a flash
or bottle; (K;) because it is mixed with redness
and yellowness and greenness; mentioned by
AHát on the authority of As: (TA:) pl. مَشَاوِبُ:
(AHát, K:) or the pl. signifies [receptacles of the
sorts called] أَسْفَاط [pl. of سَفَطٌ] and حُقَق [pl. of
حُقَّةٌ] made of palm-leaves. (A.)
