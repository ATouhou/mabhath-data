شلياقالشَّلْيَاقُ A certain northern constellation, [namely,
Lyra,] consisting of ten stars, the bright star
[alpha] of which is called النَّسْرُ الوَاقِعُ: the Arabs
liken it to a vulture (نَسْر) which has contracted
its wings to itself, as though it had alighted upon
a thing: the vulgar call [the three chief stars in]
it الأَثَافِى: and before the bright star is a dim
star which the Arabs call الأَظْفَار [i. e. the talons].
