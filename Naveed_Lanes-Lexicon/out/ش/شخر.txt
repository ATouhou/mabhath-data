شخر1
شَخَرَ, aor.
شَخِرَ, inf. n. شَخِيرٌ (S, K) and شَخْرٌ,
(K,) He raised his voice, with snorting; said of
an ass: (S:) he uttered a sound from the fauces:
or from the nose: (K:) or from the mouth, without the nose: (TA:) he (a horse) neighed: (K:)
or uttered a sound after neighing: (TA:) or
uttered a sound from his mouth, (K, TA,) without
the nose: (TA:) As says that among the sounds
made by horses are those termed شَخِيرٌ and نَخِيرٌ
and كَرِيرٌ; the first of which is from the mouth;
the second, from the nostrils; and the third, from
the chest: some say that شَخَرَ is like نَخَرَ [he
snorted]. (TA.)
شَخْرٌ The first period or stage of youth; (K,
TA;) and the sharpness thereof; like شَرْخٌ. (TA.)
―
-b2-  The part, of a رَحْل [or camel's saddle], that
is between the قَادِمَة and the آخِرَة, (O, K, TA,)
which are the كَرَّانِ: (TA:) [said to be] also
called the شَرْخ, [which is an evident mistake,
perhaps originating from its having been said that
شَخْرٌ and شَرْخٌ are syn., meaning in another sense,
mentioned above,] (O, TA,) and the شَجْر [q. v.]:
(TA:) or the space between the upper part of the
two extremities [at the fore part and hind part]
of the [saddle called] قَتَب. (JK.) ―
-b3-  And The
chink of the buttocks. (JK, O. [In the K, for
وَشَخْرُ الاِسْتِ شَقُّهَا, the reading in the JK and O,
is put وَشَخَرَ الاِسْتَ شَقَّهَا.])
شِخِّيرٌ That utters much, or often, the sound
termed نَخِير: (K:) or, as in some copies of the
K [and in the O], شَخِير: (TA:) [see نَخَرَ and
شَخَرَ:] applied to an ass in this sense, (O,) or as
signifying vociferous. (TA.)
