شمت1
شَمِتَ, aor.
شَمَتَ, (S, A, Msb, K,) inf. n. شَمَاتَةٌ
(S, K) and شَمَاتٌ, (K,) or the former is a simple
subst., (Msb, [in which no inf. n. is mentioned,])
He (an enemy) rejoiced: (TA:) or he (a man,
TA) rejoiced at the affliction of the enemy: (K,
TA:) you say, شَمِتَ بِهِ He rejoiced at his [an
enemy's] affliction. (S, A, Msb.)

شَمَّتَ see 4. ―
-b2-  تَشْمِيتٌ is syn. with تَسْمِيتٌ: [i. e.]
تَشْمِيتُ العَاطِسِ signifies The uttering a prayer
for the sneezer; (S;) when he has, in obedience
to an injunction of the Prophet, said الحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ
[Praise be to God]: (Har p. 250:) you say,
شَمَّتَ العَاطِسَ, (ISd, A, TA,) and شمّت عَلَيْهِ,
meaning [as expl. in art. سمت: or] He prayed
for the sneezer that he might not be in a state in
which his enemy might rejoice at his affliction:
(ISd, TA:) شمّت is better and more common
than سمّت: (A 'Obeyd, TA in art. سمّت and in
the present art.:) but the latter is said by Th to
be the original word: or the meaning is, he said
to the sneezer, May God put away, or avert,
from thee that on account of which one would
rejoice at thy affliction: or it is from الشَّوَامِتُ as
signifying “ the legs ” of a quadruped, as though
meaning he prayed for the sneezer that he might
be firm, or steadfast, in his obedience to God.
(L and TA from the Fáïk &c.) And شمّت لَهُ
and عَلَيْهِ, inf. n. as above, He prayed for what
was good for him; prayed for a blessing upon
him; as also سمّت, but the former is the better
and the more common. (L and TA from the T
and Fáïk &c.) ―
-b3-  Also i. q. تَخْيِيتٌ: (K:) you
say, شمّتهُ فُلَانٌ, meaning خَيَّبَهُ [Such a one disappointed him; or caused him to be disappointed
of attaining what he desired or sought: or denied
him, refused him, prohibited him from attaining,
or debarred him from, that which he desired or
sought]. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And i. q. جَمْعٌ [The act of
collecting, &c.]. (K. [But SM says that he had
searched to the utmost for this meaning without
finding it in any other lexicon.])
4
اشمتهُ اللّٰهُ بِهِ God made him (i. e. the enemy,
A, Msb) to rejoice at his affliction. (A, * Msb,
K, TA.) For فَلَا تُشْمِتْ بِىَ الْأَعَدَآءَ [Therefore
make not thou the enemies to rejoice at my affliction], in the Kur [vii. 149], Mujáhid is related
to have read ↓ فلا تُشَمِّتْ: but the correctness of
this is doubted. (TA.)
5
تَشَمُّتٌ signifies A people's returning disappointed of attaining their desire, without spoil.
(K.)
8
اِشْتِمَاتٌ [A camel's] beginning to be fat. (K.
[See the part. n., below.])
شِمَاتٌ Disappointment; frustration of one's
endeavour or hope: (IB, TA:) a subst. from
تَشْمِيتٌ as signifying تَخْيِيبٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also,
thus written in copies of the K, [and in the S,]
with kesr, (TA,) [but in the CK شَمات,] and
↓ شَمَاتَى, (K,) Persons suffering disappointment;
or failing of attaining their desire; (K, TA;)
without spoil: (TA:) [pls.] without any sing.;
(K:) or the latter has no sing. known to ISd:
(TA:) [but] ↓ شَامِتٌ has this meaning as a sing.
part, n., and شمات [app. شِمَاتٌ] is its pl. (IB,
TA.) One says, ↓ رَجَعُوا شَمَاتَى, (IAar, TA,) or
شِمَاتًا, (S,) They returned suffering disappointment; or failing of attaining their desire; (IAar,
S, TA;) without spoil; and so ↓ مُشَمَّتِينَ and
↓ مُتَشَمِّتِينَ. (TA.)
[
شَمِيتٌ Reproach (“ convicium ”): so Golius,
as from the KL; but I do not find it in my copy
of that work.]
شَمَاتَى: see شِمَاتٌ, in two places.
شَامِتٌ One rejoicing at the affliction of an
enemy: [fem. with ة: pl. masc. شُمَّاتٌ and fem.
شَوَامِتُ; or the latter may be anomalously masc.,
like فَوَارِسُ &c.; and as such it is evidently used
in the L, in one place; but in another place,
where it cites an explanation by AO, as fem.:
both are mentioned in the M and L and TA, and
the latter in the S and A also.] One says, اَللّٰهُمَّ
لَا تُطِيعَنَّ لِى شَامِتًا [O God, comply not with the
desire of one who is to me a rejoicer at my affliction]; meaning, do not with me that which one
who rejoices at my affliction likes, or approves;
for in that case, Thou wouldst be as though Thou
obeyedst him. (ISk, L, TA.) And بَاتَ فُلَانٌ
بَلَيْلَةِ الشَّوَامِتِ Such a one passed a night such as
would make to rejoice those, or those females, that
would rejoice at the affliction of an enemy; (S,
A, L, TA;) i. e., a distressing night. (A.) [And
a verse cited in the next paragraph presents, as
some read it, a similar ex. of الشَّوَامِت.]
-A2-  See
also شِمَاتٌ.
شَامِتَةٌ [fem. of شَامِتٌ, q. v.
-A2-  Also], as a subst.,
sing. of شَوَامِتُ (S, TA) which signifies The legs
of a beast. (S, A, K, TA.) One says, لَا تَرَكَ اللّٰهُ
لَهُ شَامِتَةً, i. e. [May God not leave to him] a leg
of a beast. (AA, S, A, TA.) And En-Nábighah
[Edh-Dhubyánee] says,
فَارْتَاعَ مِنْ صَوْتِ كَلَّابٍ فَبَاتَ لَهُ
طَوْعَ الشَّوَامِتِ مِنْ خَوْفٍ وَمِنْ صَرَدِ
[And that has been frightened at the voice of a
huntsman with his dogs,] and passed the night in
consequence thereof standing, (lit. obeying the
legs,) by reason of fear and [also] of cold; the
poet describing a [wild] bull: (AO, L, TA:) but
some read طَوْعُ (instead of طَوْعَ); and accord. to
this reading, the meaning is, and passed the night
having, of fear and of cold, what was agreeable
with the desire of such as would rejoice at his
affliction; the phrase being like the saying اَللّٰهُمَّ
لَا تُطِيعَنَّ لِى شَامِتًا meaning as expl. in the next
preceding paragraph: (ISk, L, TA:) or he passed
the night having [of fear and of cold] what would
rejoice the شَوَامِت that heard thereof: (AO, L,
TA:) [and in like manner, Z says,] بَاتَ طَوْعَ
الشَّوَامِتِ [without لَهُ, and with طوع in the accus.
case, lit. he passed the night obeying those, or those
females, that rejoiced at his affliction,] means, as
those that rejoiced at his affliction liked, or approved. (A.)
مُشَمَّتٌ A king prayed for (K, TA) with the
prayers that are offered for kings. (TA.)
-A2-  See
also شِمَاتٌ, last sentence.
مُشَمِّتٌ Any one praying, or who prays, for
what is good; as also مُسَمِّتٌ. (S.)
إِبِلٌ مُشْتَمِتَةٌ Camels beginning to be fat. (TA.)
مُتَشَمِّتٌ: see its pl. voce شِمَاتٌ, last sentence.
