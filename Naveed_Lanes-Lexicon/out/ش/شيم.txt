شيم1
شَامَ الشَّىْءَ فِى الشَّىْءِ, (K,) [aor. يَشِيمُ,] inf. n.
شَيْمٌ, (TA,) He hid, or concealed, the thing in
the thing: (K, TA:) and he inserted the thing in
the thing. (TA.) [Hence,] شام سَيْفَهُ, (K,) first
pers. شِمْتُهُ, (S,) aor. as above, (K,) inf. n. شَيْمٌ,
(TA,) He sheathed his sword; (S, K;) and [in
like manner] شام نَبْلَهُ [He put his arrows into
the quiver]: (TA:) and the former signifies also
He drew his sword: thus having two contr.
meanings: (S, K:) A 'Obeyd doubted of the latter
meaning; and Sh knew it not; but the verb is
said to have this meaning in a verse of ElFarezdak. (TA.) It is said in a trad. of Aboo-Bekr that a complaint was made to him against
Khálid Ibn-El-Weleed, and he said, لَا أَشِيمُ سَيْفًا
سَلَّهُ اللّٰهُ عَلَى المُشْرِكِينَ i. e. I will not sheath a
sword [which God has drawn against the believers in a plurality of gods]. (TA.) [Hence
also,] one says, شام أَبَا عُمَيْرٍ (K, TA) i. e. [He
sheathed] the ذَكَر; (TA;) meaning (assumed tropical:)  he attained
his desire of the virgin. (K, TA.) ―
-b2-  And شام
فِى الفَرَسِ سَاقَهُ He struck the mare with his
shank to make her run: (K:) or he impressed
(lit. inserted) his leg [or shank] in the belly of the
mare, striking her [with it]. (Aboo-Málik; TA.)
-A2-  شِمْتُ مَخَايِلَ الشَّىْءِ I directed my look towards the indications, or symptoms, of the thing,
waiting, or watching, for it. (S.) ―
-b2-  And [hence,
or the reverse may be the case,] شِمْتُ البَرْقَ, (S,
Msb, K, *) aor. and inf. n. as above, (Msb, TA,)
I looked at, (S, K, *) or watched, or observed,
(Msb,) the lightning, (Msb, K,) or the cloud
thereof, to see where it would rain, (S,) or to see
where it would pour, or bring rain, (Msb,) or to
see whither it tended and where it would rain:
(K:) this is done only when it flickers and disappears without delay: and [it is said, but, in my
opinion, fancifully, and with little reason, that]
the drawing and sheathing of a sword are likened
to lightning flickering and disappearing. (TA.)
[Hence the phrase, شِمْتُ بَرْقَ فُلَانٍ (assumed tropical:)  I looked
hoping for the benefits of such a one: mentioned
by Freytag on the authority of Meyd: and the
like is said in Har p. 319.] And شام السَّحَابَ He
looked at the clouds from afar: and [in like
manner,] النَّارَ the fire. (TA.) It is said in a
prov.,
لَا تَشِمِ الغَيْثَ فَقَدْ أَوْدَى النَّقَدْ
i. e. [Look not thou hoping for rain, for] the
lambs have perished: addressed to him who
mourns for that which has past. (Meyd.) And
one says, فُلَانٌ مُوسِرٌ وَلَا أَشِيمُهُ مِنْ فَقْرٍ (assumed tropical:)  [Such
a one is wealthy, and I do not look at him in
hope by reason of poverty]; meaning that he is
independent of him. (Z, TA.) ―
-b3-  [Hence also,]
شِمْ مَا بَيْنَهُمَا (tropical:)  Compute thou, or estimate, or
consider, (K, TA,) and look, or see, (TA,) what
[relation, or difference,] is between them two.
(K, TA. [In the CK, شَيَّمَ is erroneously put for
شِمْ; and قَدَّرَهُ, in the explanation, for قَدِّرْهُ.])
-A3-
شَامَ also signifies It (a thing, TA) entered,
فِى شَىْءٍ into a thing; (K, TA;) quasi-pass. of
the same verb in the latter of the two senses expl.
in the first sentence of this art.; (TA;) and so
↓ انشام, (S, K, TA,) and ↓ اشام, and ↓ اشتام, and
↓ تشيّم, and ↓ شيّم. (K, TA.) ―
-b2-  Also, (K,) aor.
as above, (TA,) inf. n. شَيْمٌ and شُيُومٌ, He made a
valid charge, or assault, or attack, in war, or
battle. (K.)
-A4-  Also, (K,) aor. as above, (TA,)
He (a man) had a black رَقْمَة [app. meaning
spot, or mole, i. e. شَامَة,] apparent in his skin.
(K.) And شِيمَ, inf. n. شَيْمٌ, [perhaps a mistranscription for شَيَمٌ,] He was marked with a شَامَة
[or mole]: or, as some say, [the pass. part. n.]
مَشْيُومٌ [signifying “ marked with a شامة ”] has
no verb: and AZ says that ↓ شَيَمٌ, signifying the
having upon him a شامة, has no known verb:
(TA:) or شَيَمٌ is an inf. n. signifying the having
upon him شَام [i. e. moles]. (Ham p. 361.)
-A5-
شَامَ فُلَانًا, (K,) aor. as above, (TA,) He soiled the
legs, or feet, of such a one with dust, or earth:
(K, TA:) in [some of] the copies of the K,
غَيَّرَ رِجْلَيْهِ بِالشِّيَامِ; but correctly, [as in the CK
and in my MS copy of the K,] غَبَّرَ; and accord.
to the M, from الشِّيَام, [meaning that the verb is
derived from this word,] i. e. التُّرَاب. (TA.)
