―
-b2-  [Hence,] one says, الحَدِيثُ ذُو شُجُونٍ, (S,
Meyd, L, K,) شُجُون being pl. of شَجْنٌ, with the
ج quiescent; (Meyd;) a prov., (Meyd, L,) meaning (assumed tropical:)  The story is involved, or intricate; (S,
Meyd, L;) or has several ways [in which it may
be understood]; (Meyd;) or has several modes,
or manners; and objects of aim: (L, K:) applied
to a story by which one calls to mind another:
(A'Obeyd, Meyd, L:) the first who said it was
Dabbeh Ibn-Udd Ibn-Tábikhah: he had two
sons, named Saad and So'eyd: and some camels
belonging to him ran away by night, so he sent
his two sons to seek them; and they separated;
and Saad found them and restored them; but
So'eyd went on seeking them; and El-Hárith
Ibn-Kaab met him; and there were upon the
young man two [garments such as are called]
burds (بُرْدَانِ), which El-Hárith asked him to
give to him, but he refused to comply with his
desire; whereupon he slew him, and took his two
burds: and Dabbeh, when he saw a dark object
in the night, used to say, أَسَعْدٌ أَمْ سُعَيْدٌ [“ Is it
Saad or So'eyd? ” (see سَعْدٌ)]; and this saying
of his became current as a prov.: some time after
this, having gone on pilgrimage, he met El-
Hárith Ibn-Kaab at 'Okádh, and saw upon him
the two burds of his son So'eyd, and asked him
respecting them; and he answered that he had
met a young man wearing them, and slain him,
and taken them: Dabbeh said, “With this thy
sword? ” and he answered, “Yes: ” and he said,
“ Give it me that I may look at it, for I think it
to be sharp: ” and El-Hárith gave it him: and
he took it, and shook it, and said, إِنَّ الحَدِيثَ ذُو
شُجُونٍ; and slew him with it: whereupon it was
said to him, “O Dabbeh, in the sacred month? ”
and he said, سَبَقَ السَّيْفُ العَذْلَ [“ The sword preceded the censure ”): these three provs. he originated. (Meyd.)
شُجْنٌ and شِجْنٌ: see the next paragraph.
شَجَنٌ Grief, mourning, lamentation, sorrow,
sadness, or unhappiness; (S, L, K;) and anxiety:
(L, K:) pl. أَشْجَانٌ (S, L, K) and شُجُونٌ; (L,
K; [in the latter of which these pls. are mentioned after all the explanations of the sing.;])

wherever it be: (S, L, K:) pl. شُجُونٌ (S, L, Msb,
K) and أَشْجَانٌ; (L, Msb, K;) the latter being
pl. of شَجِينٌ also. (L.) A rájiz says,
لِى شَجَنَانِ شَجَنٌ بِنَجْدِ
وَشَجَنٌ لِى بِبِلَادِ السِّنْدِ
[I have two wants; a want in Nejd, and I have
a want in the country of Es-Sind]. (S.)
-A2-  Also
An intricately-intermingling branch of a tree;
(L, K;) and a شُعْبَة [i. e. branch, or branchlet,
or the like,] of anything; (K;) like ↓ شِجْنَةٌ and
↓ شُجْنَةٌ and ↓ شَجْنَةٌ (L, K) in the former sense:
(L: [accord. to the K, app., in the latter sense:])
or, accord. to IAar, one says ↓ شُجْنَةٌ and ↓ شُجْنٌ
meaning a branch of a tree, [or the latter app.
means branches, for it seems to be a coll. gen. n.,]
and ↓ شِجْنَةٌ and ↓ شِجْنٌ, and [the pl. of ↓ شُجْنَةٌ
is] شُجْنَاتٌ and شُجُنَاتٌ: (L:) or, accord. to J,
(L,) ↓ شِجْنَةٌ and ↓ شُجْنَةٌ signify roots of trees intricately intermingling: (S, L:) [but] the primary signification of ↓ شِجْنَةٌ and ↓ شُجْنَةٌ is a
branchlet (a شُعْبَة of a غُصْن) of a tree: (L:) or
↓ شِجْنَةٌ signifies tangled, or luxuriant, or abundant and dense, trees. (Msb.) ―

-b4-  Also, (K,) or شجنة, (L,
[thus written without any syll. signs, perhaps fem.
of شَجَنٌ, i. e. شَجَنَةٌ, but it seems to be indicated
by the context in the L that it is ↓ شُجْنَةٌ,]) A

parts are interknit, one with another, (L, K, *)
like the parts of a tree. (L.)

signifies also (assumed tropical:)  Relationship closely, or intimately,
connected. (L.) One says, بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَهُ شِجْنَةُ رَحِمٍ,
and رَحِمٍ ↓ شُجْنَةُ, (assumed tropical:)  Between me and him is a relationship closely, or intimately, connected. (S.)
And it is said in a trad., الرَّحِمُ شِجْنَةٌ مِنَ اللّٰهِ i. e.
(tropical:)  الرَّحِمُ is derived from الرَّحْمٰن: (S, L: [see
رَحِمٌ:]) or, accord. to AO, (L,) the meaning is,
[الرَّحِم is] relationship, from God, closely, or intimately, connected, like the roots of trees. (S,
L.) ―

their saying عَابِلَتِى عَبُولُ [i. e., app., My withholder is death, or shall be death alone; for
شَجَنَتْهُ شَجُونُ may be rendered Death withheld
him, like as عَبَلَتْهُ عَبُولُ is rendered “ death separated him ”]. (L.)
