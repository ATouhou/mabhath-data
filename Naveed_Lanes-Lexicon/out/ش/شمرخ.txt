comprises the شَمَارِيخ: (Msb voce عِذْقٌ:) or an
عِثْكَال upon which are unripe dates, or grapes:
(K:) originally relating to a raceme of dates; but
sometimes, to grapes: (L:) and the former word
[or each] signifies a small bunch of grapes,
growing apart, but attached to the lower portion

TA.) [See غُرَّةٌ سَائِلَةٌ, in art. سيل.] Accord. to J,
The horse itself [that has such a blaze] is also
thus called; but this is a mistake: (K:) it seems
