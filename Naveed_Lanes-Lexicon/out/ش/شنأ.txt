شنأ1
شَنِئَهُ, (Th, S, Mgh, Msb, K, &c.,) and شَنَأَهُ,
(K,) but this is said by AHeyth to be a bad dial.
var. of the former, (TA,) aor.
شَنَاَ, (Msb, K,) inf. n.
شَنْءٌ (AO, S, Msb, K) and شِنْءٌ and شُنْءٌ (Aboo-
'Amr Esh-Sheybánee, S, K) and شَنْأَةٌ (K, TA, in
the CK شَناءَة [i. e. شَنَآءَةٌ, which is afterwards added
in the TA, not as in the K, and mentioned in the
S but not there said to be an inf. n.,]) and شَنَأٌ
(TA from Es-Safákusee) and شَنَآءٌ (TA [as from J,
but perhaps from Az, for I do not find it in the
S,]) and مَشْنَأٌ (S, CK, and TA as from Es-Safá-
kusee, not as from the K,) and مَشْنَأَةٌ and مَشْنُؤَةٌ
(K, TA, the last in the CK مَشْنُوءَة [i. e. مَشْنُوْءَةٌ],)
and مَشْنِئَةٌ (TA from Es-Safákusee) and شَنَآنٌ,
(S, K,) which is anomalous as being of a measure
regularly employed [only] for the inf. n. of a verb
signifying motion and agitation, as ضَرَبَانٌ and
خَفَقَانٌ, (S, TA,) for though it has been said that
[hatred (which it signifies) is attended by anger
and] anger is accompanied by agitation of the
heart, there is no necessary connection between
hatred and anger, and it is anomalous also as being
of a measure not proper to [the inf. n. of] a
trans. verb, (TA,) and شَنْآنٌ, (S, Msb, K,) which
is also anomalous, and [said to be] the only
instance of its kind (S, TA) except لَيَّانٌ, though
some few others have been mentioned, as زَيْدَانٌ,
but this is not well known, [and خَشْيَانٌ, of which
the same may be said,] and وَشْكَانٌ [perhaps a
simple subst.], and جَوْلَانٌ which is said to occur
in a verse [perhaps contracted from جَوَلَان by
poetic license], (TA,) and AO mentions شَنَانٌ,
without ء, as being like شَنْآنٌ; (S;) these inf. ns.
being fourteen, which is said by IKtt to be the
greatest number of inf. ns. to any one verb, only
seven other verbs, he says, having this number,
namely, قَدَرَ, لَقِىَ, وَرَدَ, هَلَكَ, تَمَّ, مَكَثَ and غَلَبَ;
but Es-Safákusee makes the inf. ns. of شَنِئَ to be
fifteen, [though the fifteenth form (which is perhaps مَشْنُوْءَةٌ) I do not find mentioned,] and this
is the greatest number known; (TA;) He hated
him: (IKoot, IF, S, ISd, IKtt, Mgh, Msb, K,
&c.:) or, as some say, he hated him vehemently.
(TA.) يشنى, [app. يُشْنَى, for يُشْنَأُ,] with the
hemzeh changed into ى, occurs in a trad. (TA.)
And شُنِئَ signifies He (a man, S) was hated, (S,
and so accord. to some copies of the K,) or was
rendered hateful, or an object of hatred, (so
accord. to other copies of the K,) even if beautiful
or comely. (S, K.)
-A2-  شَنِئَ لَهُ حَقَّهُ, (K,) so says
A'Obeyd, or, accord. to Th, شَنَأَ إِلَيْهِ, like مَنَعَ [in
form], and this is the more correct, aor. of each
شَنَاَ,
(TA,) He gave him his right, or due. (A'Obeyd,
Th, K, TA.) And شَنِئَ بِهِ He acknowledged it:
(S, Msb, K:) or he gave him (K) his right, or
due, (TA,) [or the meaning in the K may be he
gave it,] and declared himself clear, or quit, of
him or it; as also شَنَأَ: (K:) [but accord. to SM,
this is wrong, for he says that] the author of the
K should have said, or شَنِئَ إِلَيْهِ, like شَنَأَ, aor.
شَنَاَ,
he gave him, and declared himself clear, or quit,
of him or it. (TA.) And شَنِئَ الشَّىْءَ He produced
the thing: (K, TA:) or, as A'Obeyd says, شَنِئَ حَقَّهُ
he acknowledged his right, or due, and produced
it from his possession. (TA.)
6
تَشَانَؤُوا They hated one another. (S, O, K.)
شَنْءٌ and شِنْءٌ and شُنْءٌ [all mentioned above as
inf. ns., when used as simple substs. signify
Hatred; and thus ↓ شَنَآءَةٌ, likewise mentioned
above as an inf. n., signifies accord. to the S;
and so ↓ شَنِيْئَةٌ accord. to Freytag, as on the
authority of Meyd; and app. also شَنُوْءَةٌ, q. v.; or
all signify] vehement hatred; in which sense the
first is expl. by AO: (TA:) or ↓ شَنَآءَةٌ signifies
hatred mixed with enmity and evilness of disposition. (Ham p. 108)
شَنُؤَةٌ: see شَنُوْءَةٌ, in three places.
شَنَآءَةٌ: see شَنْءٌ, in two places.
-A2-  Also, and
↓ شَنَائِيَةٌ, epithets applied to a man, Rendered hateful, or an object of hatred, evil in disposition. (Lth,
O, TA.) [See also the latter word voce شَنْآن;
and see مَشْنُوْءٌ, and مِشْنَآءٌ.]
شَنُوْءَةٌ The removing oneself far, or keeping
aloof, from unclean things; (S, K, TA;) and the
continual doing so, or the continual purification
of oneself; as also ↓ شَنُؤَةٌ; and accord. to the K,
شُنُوْءَةٌ, but this is not found elsewhere. (TA.) ―
-b2-
Hence, (S,) أَزْدُ شَنُوْءَةَ, the appellation of a tribe of
El-Yemen; (S, K; *) sometimes called أَزْدُ شَنُوَّةَ:
(ISk, S, K:) [or] this tribe was so called because
of شَنْآن among them; (K, TA;) i. e. because of
mutual hatred that occurred among them: (TA:)
[whence it seems that شَنُوْءَةٌ signifies also Hatred:]
or because of their removing far from their
[original] district: or, accord. to El-Khafájee,
because of their high lineage, and good deeds;
from the phrase رَجُلُ شَنُوْدَةٍ, meaning A man of
pure lineage and of manly virtue; and AO says
the like. (TA.) ―
-b3-  [And accord. to Reiske, as
stated by Freytag, (who has written it ↓ شَنُؤَةٌ in
all its senses,) it is expl. by Meyd as meaning
What is esteemed sordid, of words and of actions.]
-A2-  Also One who removes himself far, or keeps
aloof, from unclean things; (K, TA;) and so
↓ شَنُؤَةٌ. (TA.) Thus both of these words are
epithets, as well as substs. (TA.)
شَنِيْئَةٌ: see شَنْءٌ.
شَنْآن, of which the fem. is شَنْآنَةٌ and شَنْأَى, [so
that one may say either شَنْآنٌ or شَنْآنُ,] is an
epithet applied to a man; (K;) [signifying either
Hating or (like مَشْنُوْءٌ) hated; the former meaning seeming to be indicated by what immediately
precedes it in the K; but the latter appears from
what here follows to be the right meaning, and
perhaps it may be that which is meant in the K;]
as also ↓ شَنَانِئَةٌ or ↓ شَنَائِيَةٌ [q. v. voce شَنَآءَةٌ]:
so accord. to different copies of the K. (TA.) ―
-b2-
In the Kur v. 3 and 11, it is accord. to some an
inf. n., and some read there شَنَآن: [see 1, first
sentence:] accord. to others, it is an epithet, signifying مُبْغَضٌ or بَغِيضٌ [i. e. Hated or odious].
(TA.) ―
-b3-  شَنْآنُ الشِّتَآءِ, in a trad. of Kaab, is said
to be a metaphorical expression for بَرْدُ الشِّتَآءِ
(tropical:)  [The cold of winter]; because it is hated: or, as
some say, by the بَرْد thereof is meant ease and
repose: and the meaning intended is either
mutual hatred or ease and repose. (TA.)
شَنَائِيَةٌ: see شَنَآءَةٌ, and شَنْآن.
شَنَانِئَةٌ: see شَنْآن.
شَانِئٌ Hating, or a hater, (Fr, S, Mgh, Msb,
TA,) and an enemy: (Fr, TA:) fem. with ة.
(Mgh, Msb.) ―
-b2-  لَا أَبَا لِشَانِئِكَ, as also لَا أَبَ لِشَانِئِكَ,
(S, O, [but in my two copies of the S لِشَانِيكَ,
which perhaps expresses the general pronunciation, and in the TA لا ابا لشانئك and لا ابا لشانيك,])
means لِمُبْغِضِكَ [i. e., lit., May there be no father
to thy hater]; and is said by ISk to be a metonymical expression for لَا أَبَا لَكَ [q. v., lit. an imprecation, but generally meant as an expression of
praise]. (S, O, TA.)
شَوَانِئُ المَالِ means [Camels, or the like,] not
avariciously retained; as though hated, and therefore liberally given away: (IAar, K, TA:) شوانئ
being app. an act. part. n. [in the pl.] used in the
sense of a pass. part. n., like the instances in
مَآءٌ دَافِقٌ and عِيشَةٌ رَاضِيَةٌ. (MF, TA.)
مَشْنَأٌ, applied to a man, (A'Obeyd, S, O,) like
مَشْنَعٌ [in form, and perhaps in meaning],
(A'Obeyd, TA,) Foul, or ugly, in aspect; as also
↓ مِشْنَآءٌ: (S, O:) or foul, or ugly, (K, TA,) in
face, (TA,) even if made an object of love [by
good qualities]: (K, TA:) [originally an inf. n.,
and therefore] used alike as sing. (S, O, K) and
dual (S, O) and pl. (S, O, K) and masc. and
fem.: (K:) so says Lth: (TA:) or one who hates
men; (K;) and so ↓ مِشْنَآءٌ, accord. to 'Alee Ibn-
Hamzeh El-Isbahánee: (TA:) or ↓ this last signifies one whom men hate: or it may be well
rendered one who does much for which he is to be
hated; for it is one of the measures of the act.
part. n. [used in an intensive sense]. (A'Obeyd,
K.)
مِشْنَآءٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in
three places.
مَشْنُوْءٌ, applied to a man, (S,) Hated, (S, and
so in some copies of the K, [see also شَنْآن,]) or
rendered hateful, or an object of hatred, (so
accord. to other copies of the K,) even if beautiful, or comely; (S, K;) and مَشْنُوٌّ and مَشْنِىٌّ
signify the same. (K in art. شنو.)
مَشْنِيْئَةٌ, occurring in a trad. of 'Áïsheh, [A kind
of food that is supped, or sipped;] i. q. حَسَآءٌ and
تَلْبِينَةٌ: [see these two words:] said by IAth to be
irregularly formed from مَشْنُوْءَةٌ, by changing the
ء into ى [so that the word becomes مَشْنُويَةٌ, and
then, by rule, مَشْنِيَّةٌ, which is mentioned in the
TA, in art. شنو, as occurring thus in a trad.,] and
then by restoring the ء [in the place of the second
ى], the meaning being hated. (TA.)
