-b2-  See also 2. ―
-b3-  شَادُوا الدِّينَ (assumed tropical:)  They strengthened
and exalted the religion: from شَادَ in the first of
the senses expl. above: (Har p. 5:) [or rather
from this verb as syn. with شَيَّدَ and أَشَادَ.] ―
-b4-
See also 4. ―
-b5-  As inf. n. of شَادَ in the phrase
شَادَ بِالإِبِلِ, aor. as above, (TK,) شِيَادٌ signifies
(assumed tropical:)  The calling camels, (Ibn-'Abbád, O, K, TA,)
as also ↓ إِشَادَةٌ, (Ibn-'Abbád, O,) raising the voice
in doing so. (TA.) ―
-b6-  Also, (K,) as inf. n. of
the same verb, (TK,) (assumed tropical:)  The rubbing perfume with
the skin; (K;) as also ↓ تَشَيُّدٌ; in some copies of
the K, ↓ تَشْيِيدٌ: (TA:) [the former of these two
seems to be the right; and the meaning seems to
be, the rubbing the skin with perfume; for,]
accord. to AA, one says بِهٰذَا الطِّيبِ ↓ تَشَيَّدْ,
meaning Rub thy skin with this perfume. (O.)
-A2-  شَادَ, (said of a man, TA,) aor. as above, (K,)
inf. n. شَيْدٌ, (TA,) also signifies He perished, or
died. (K.)

شيّدهُ, (A, L, Msb, TA,) inf. n. تَشْيِيدٌ, (L,
Msb, TA,) He raised it high; (A, Msb, TA;)
namely, a palace, (A,) or a building; (Msb,
TA;) as also ↓ اشادهُ, (A, L, TA,) and ↓ شَادَهُ:
(A: [this last is app. included with the two other
verbs, in the A, as having this meaning, which is
confirmed, as pertaining to it, by an explanation
of its pass. part. n., مَشِيدٌ, q. v.:]) or شيّدهُ [implies a repetition of the act of building: (see
مَشِيدٌ:) or] signifies he built it firmly, or strongly,
and raised it high. (L.) ―
-b2-  See also 1.
4
اشادهُ: see 2. ―
-b2-  Hence, (L,) إِشَادَةٌ signifies
(tropical:)  The raising the voice in saying a thing (Lth, S,
L, K) [of any kind, or] such as one's companion
dislikes; like تَنْدِيدٌ. (Lth, L.) See also 1. You
say, اشاد صَوْتَهُ and بِصَوْتِهِ (tropical:)  He raised his voice.
(A.) And اشاد بِهِ (tropical:)  He proclaimed it, or cried
it, raising his voice; namely, a stray, or any other
thing: (As, L:) (tropical:)  he made it known; (AA, S, A,
K; *) namely, a stray. (S, K.) And اشاد بِذِكْرِهِ
(tropical:)  He raised his good fame, by praising him;
raised a good report of him: (S, * A, L:) and he
raised his ill fame, by dispraising him; raised an
evil report of him: and اشادهُ and ↓ شَادَهُ he raised
his notoriety or fame. (L.) And اشاد عَلَيْهِ (tropical:)  He
published against him something disliked, disapproved, or odious: one says, اشاد عَلَيْهِ قَبِيحًا
and بِقَبِيحٍ (tropical:)  [He published against him something
bad, evil, abominable, or foul]. (A.) ―
-b3-  And
إِشَادَةٌ also signifies (tropical:)  The act of destroying: (K,
TA:) from the same word as syn. with تَنْدِيدٌ.
(TA.)

تَشَيَّدَ see 1, in two places.
شَيْدٌ, a Pers. word, [or rather of Pers. origin,
from شَيْدَا,] Possessed; or mad, or insane: or
intoxicated. (TA.)
شِيدٌ Anything with which a wall is plastered,
(S, A, K,) consisting of gypsum and the like;
(A, K;) J says, of gypsum or بَلَاط; but this last
word is a mistake, [probably originated by an
early transcriber of the S,] for مِلَاط, i. e. mud, or
clay: (K:) or [peculiarly] gypsum. (Msb.) ―
-b2-
Az says that some of the Arabs sometimes call
thus A حِصْن [i. e. fortress, fort, or fortified
place]. (TA.)
مَشِيدٌ Plastered with شِيد; and so, as some say,
↓ مُشَيَّدٌ: (T:) or built with gypsum: (Msb:) or
made with شيد, (S, A, K,) i. e. gypsum; and so,
some say, ↓ مُشَيَّدٌ: (A:) or the latter signifies
raised high, or made lofty; (A 'Obeyd, S, A, K;)
and so the former, applied to a place, (A,) or
building: (TA:) the former has this meaning in
the Kur xxii. 44: (Jel:) J says in the S, Ks
says, مَشِيدٌ is applied to a sing., from the saying
in the Kur, [ubi suprà,] وَقَصْرٍ مَشِيدٍ; and ↓ مُشَيَّدٌ,
to a pl., from the saying in the same, [iv. 80,]
فِى بُرُوجٍ مُشَيَّدَةٍ: but this is a mistake: what Ks
says is that مُشَيَّدَةٌ, with ة and teshdeed, is a pl.
[i. e. a lexicological, not a grammatical, pl.] of
مُشَيَّدٌ: (IB, K: *) or the saying of Ks [if as quoted
in the S] may be expl. accord. to the opinion of
those who hold that مَشِيدٌ and مُشَيَّدٌ both signify
plastered with شِيد, on the supposition that the
Arabs did not use مَشِيدَةٌ as applied to a pl., but
only to a sing.: (Az, L:) [for] Fr says that the
pass. part. n. of the unaugmented verb only is
used when applied to a sing. and not denoting
repetition, or muchness; but either this or the
pass. part. n. of the verb of the measure فَعَّلَ may
be used when applied to a sing. and denoting
repetition, or muchness, and when applied to a
pl.: thus you say كَبْشٌ مَذْبُوحٌ [“ a slaughtered
ram ”]; but not مُذَبَّحٌ; but you may say ثَوْبٌ
مُخَرَّقٌ [as meaning “ a garment in which holes
have been repeatedly made,” or “ in which many
holes have been made,” or “ much pierced with
holes,” as well as ثَوْبٌ مَخْرُوقٌ meaning “ a garment in which a hole has been made,” or “ in
which holes have been made,”] and كِبَاشٌ مُذَبَّحَةٌ
[“ slaughtered rams ”]: and hence you may say
↓ قَصْرٌ مُشَيَّدٌ; because تَشْيِيدٌ denotes building, and
the act of building is repeated, and a building
becomes high by degrees. (L.)
مُشَيَّدٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in
four places.
