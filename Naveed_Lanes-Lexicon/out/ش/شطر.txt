شَطْرٌ The half of a thing; (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K;)
as also ↓ شَطِيرٌ: (TA:) pl. [of pauc.] أَشْطُرٌ (S, K)
and [of mult.] شُطُورٌ. (K.) It is said in a prov.,
اُحْلُبْ حَلَبًا لَكَ شَطْرُهُ [Milk thou a milking of
which half shall be for thee]. (S.) And one says
شَعَرٌ شَطْرَانِ Hair [half] black and [half] white.
(A.) Accord. to Ibráheem El-Harbee, (O,) the
saying of the Prophet, مَنْ مَنَعَ صَدَقَةً فَإِنَّا آخِذُوهَا
وَشَطْرَ مَالِهِ [Whoso refuses to render a poor-rate,
verily we take it from him, and half of his property], thus related by Bahz, is a mistake, and
the right wording is, وَشُطِرَ مَالُهُ, meaning and his
property shall be divided into two halves, and the
collector of the poor-rate shall have the option
given him and shall take that rate from out of the
better of the two halves, as a punishment for the
man's refusal of the rate; (O, K;) but it is said
that this law was afterwards abrogated: (O:)
Esh-Sháfi'ee, however, says that, in the old time,
when one refused the poor-rate of his property, it
was taken from him, and half of his property was
taken as a punishment for his refusal; and he
adduces this trad. as evidence thereof; but says
that in recent times, only the poor-rate was taken
from him, and this trad. was asserted to be abrogated. (TA. [More is there said on this subject,
but I omit it as unprofitable.]) ―

فَوَضَعَ شَطْرَهَا means (assumed tropical:)  [And He remitted] part, or
somewhat, thereof; (K;) i. e., of the prayer.

-b5-  Either the fore pair or the
hind pair of the teats of a she-camel: she has two
pairs of teats, a fore pair and a hind pair, and
each pair is thus called: (S, K:) and either of the
two teats of a ewe or she-goat: (IAar, TA:) pl.
أَشْطُرٌ. (S, TA.) Hence the saying, (S,) فُلَانٌ
حَلَبَ الدَّهْرَ أَشْطُرَهُ (tropical:)  Such a one has known, or
tried, varieties of fortune: (S, * TA:) has experienced the good and evil of fortune; (S, K,
TA;) its straitness and its ampleness: being
likened to one who has milked all the teats of a
camel, that which yields plenty of milk and that
which does not; the fore pair being the good;
and the hind pair, the evil: or, as some say,
أَشْطُر means streams, or flows, of milk: and [in
like manner] one says, حَلَبَ الدَّهْرَ شَطْرَيْهِ. (TA.)
And, as is said in the “ Kámil ” of Mbr, one says
of a man experienced in affairs, فُلَانٌ قَدْ حَلَبَ
أَشْطُرَهُ (tropical:)  Such a one has endured the difficulties
and [enjoyed] the ampleness of fortune, and
managed his affairs in poverty and in wealth:
lit., has milked his pairs of teats, one pair after
another. (TA.) ―
-b6-  Also A direction in which
one looks or goes or the like. (S, A, Msb, K.)
One says, قَصَدَ شَطْرَهُ He went in his, or its,
direction; towards him, or it. (S, A.) And it is
said in the Kur [ii. 139 and 144 and 145],
فَوَلِّ وَجْهَكَ شَطْرَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ Then turn thou
thy face in the direction of the Sacred Mosque.
(Fr, S.) The noun in this sense has no verb
belonging to it: or one says, شَطَرَ شَطْرَهُ [expl.
above: see 1]. (K.) ―
-b7-  Also Distance, or remoteness. (TA.)
شُطُرٌ: see شَطِيرٌ [of which it is both a syn. and
a pl.].

(S, K,) or vessel, (A, K,) half full. (S, A, K.)
شَطُورٌ A ewe, or she-goat, having one teat
longer than the other; (S, O, K;) like حَضُونٌ in
this sense [and perhaps in others also, agreeably
with what is said of شِطَارٌ in the first paragraph of
this art.]: (S in art. حَضن:) and (so in the S and
O, but in the K “ or ”) one having one of her
teats dried up: (S, O, K:) and a she-camel
having two of her teats dried up; for she has four
teats. (S, O.) And A garment, or piece of cloth,
having one of the two extremities of its breadth
longer than the other. (O, K.) ―
-b2-  See also the
next paragraph.
شَطِيرٌ: see شَطْرٌ, in two places.
-A2-  Also Distant,
or remote; (As, S, A, Mgh, Msb, K;) applied to
a town, or country, (As, S,) an abode, (A, Mgh,
Msb,) and a tribe. (A.) And so ↓ شُطُرٌ in the
phrase نَوًى شُطُرٌ [A distant tract, or region,
towards which one journeys]: (S, K:) so too
↓ شَطُورٌ in the phrase نِيَّةٌ شَطُورٌ [which may mean
as above, (like نِيَّةٌ شَطُونٌ,) or a remote, or farreaching, intention, or aim, or purpose]. (TA.)
―
-b2-  Also A stranger; (S, O, Msb, K;) because
of his remoteness from his people; (TA;) as in a
verse cited voce إِذًا: (S, O:) or one who is alone,

in anger: (see 1, last sentence:) or] one who
disagrees with his family, (Msb,) and who
wearies them by his wickedness (S, Msb, K) and
baseness (Msb) and guile: (TA:) i. q. خَلِيعٌ
[meaning as above, and having other similar
meanings; generally vitious, or immoral; bad,
evil, wicked, or mischievous]: (A:) accord. to
some, it is post-classical: Aboo-Is-hák says that
it signifies one who takes a wrong course: it is
also expl. as signifying one who outstrips; like
the [messenger called] بَرِيد, who takes a long
journey in a short space of time: and hence, [as a
conventional term of the mystics,] it is applied to
one who outstrips, and is quick, in attaining
nearness to God: or as meaning one who has
wearied his family, and withdrawn far from
them [n spirit], though with them [bodily], because of their inviting him to carnal lusts, and
accustomed ways [of the world]: (TA:) [in the
present day, it is applied to a sharper, or clever
thief: and to any clever, or cunning, person:] pl.
شُطَّارٌ. (TA.)
مَشْطُورٌ [Halved. ―
