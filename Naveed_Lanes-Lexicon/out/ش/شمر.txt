شمّر, (S, A, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَشْمِيرٌ, (S, K,)
He raised, (S, Msb, K,) or tucked up, or contracted,
(A,) his garment, (Msb, K,) or his waist-wrapper,
(S,) [or his sleeve,] or his skirts. (A.) One says,
شمّر عَنْ سَاقِهِ [He raised, or tucked up, his garment, or waist-wrapper, or skirts, from his shank].
(S.) [And in like manner, ↓ تشمّر signifies He
raised, or tucked up, his garment, &c.: for] one
says also, تشمّر عَنْ سَاعِدَيْهِ [He tucked up his
sleeves from his fore arms]. (TA.) It is said in
a prov., شَمَّرَ ذَيْلًا وَادَّرَعَ لَيْلًا i. e. [lit.] He contracted, or drew up, his [or a] skirt [and clad
himself with night as with a tunic]: (TA:) or
شَمِرْ ذَيْلًا وَادَّرِعْ لَيْلًا, meaning (tropical:)  Use thou prudence, or precaution, or good judgment, and
journey all the night. (S and K in art. درع.) ―
-b2-
[Hence,] (assumed tropical:)  He strove, or laboured, exerted himself or his power or ability, employed himself
vigorously or laboriously or with energy, or took
extraordinary pains, (AA, Msb, TA,) and was
quick, (AA, TA,) فِى الأَمْرِ [in the affair]; as
also ↓ شَمَرَ, inf. n. شَمْرٌ: (TA:) and فِى العِبَادَةِ [in
religious service]: (Msb:) and فِى سَيْرِهِ [in his
pace, or journeying]; like تَجَرَّدَ and اِنْجَرَدَ. (L
and TA in art. جرد.) Also, (K,) inf. n. as above;
(TA;) and ↓ شَمَرَ, (K,) aor.
شَمُرَ, inf. n. شَمْرٌ; (TA;)
and ↓ انشمر, and ↓ تشمّر; (K;) (assumed tropical:)  He passed along
striving, or exerting himself, or vigorously: or
he passed along with a proud and self-conceited
gait; (K;) [and] ↓ مَرَّ يَشْمُرُ, inf. n. as above, has
the latter meaning. (S.) And شمّر فِى الأَمْرِ (assumed tropical:)  He
was, or became, light, or active, (S, Msb, K,)

became vehement; like كَشَفَتْ عَنْ سَاقٍ]. (A.)
―
-b3-  Also He contracted a thing; syn. قَلَّصَ;
(TA;) [and so, perhaps, ↓ شَمَرَ; for] الشَّمْرُ signifies تَقْلِيصُ الشَّىْءِ, like التَّشْمِيرُ: (K:) [or the
author of the TA may have misunderstood this
explanation in the K, and the meaning may be it
(a thing) contracted, or became contracted; for
قَلَّصَ is trans. and also (like قَلَصَ) intrans.: that
شمّر has this latter meaning, whether it have also,
or have not, the former, is shown by the statement
that] one says, شَمَّرَتِ الشَّفَةُ meaning قَلَصَت [i. e.
The lip became contracted, or became contracted
upwards]: (M in art. قلص:) and ↓ تشمّر [in like
manner] signifies it (a thing) contracted, or became contracted; syn. تَقَلَّصَ. (TA.) ―

IAar, S, A, K;) and in like manner, a hawk;
(A;) and he discharged, or shot, an arrow: (As,
IAar, S, A, Msb:) and hence, (As, S,) (tropical:)  he sent,
sent forth, or sent away, (As, S, M, A, K,) a
thing. (M, A.) [See also سَمَّرَ.] And شمّر الإِبِلَ,
inf. n. as above; (TA;) and ↓ اشمرها; (K;) (assumed tropical:)  He
hastened the camels; made them to hasten; syn.
أَكْمَشَهَا, [which seems to be either syn. with, or a
mistranscription for, كَمَّشَهَا, (see سَمَّرَ,)] and
أَعْجَلَهَا. (O, K, TA.) ―
-b5-  And شَمَّرْتُ النَّخْلَ (tropical:)  I
cut off the fruit of the palm-trees; syn. صَرَمْتُهُ;
(A, TA;) or so ↓ شَمَرْتُهُ, (Ibn-'Abbád, O,) [for]

-b3-  See also 2

raised, or tucked up, or contracted; and so signifies ↓ انشمر.] ―
