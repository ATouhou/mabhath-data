(TA.)
شَيْطَان [i. e. شَيْطَانٌ or شَيْطَانُ, accord. to different authorities, as shown below, A devil; and
with the article ال, the devil, Satan;] is, accord.
to some, from شَاطَ, (Msb, K, TA,) as signifying
“ it was, or became, null, void, of no account; ”
and the like: (Msb, TA:) or “ he perished: ”
(K, TA:) or “ he went away: ” or “ it burned,”
or “ became burnt: ” two reasons given for this
derivation are, that among the names of the devil
are المُذْهَبُ and البَاطِلُ: and another is this; that
several read, in the Kur xxvi. 210, الشَّيَاطُونَ
[instead of الشَّيَاطِينُ]: but some say that it is from
شَطَنَ, signifying “ he became distant,” or “ remote: ” Sb gives both of these derivations:
respecting the former of which, it should be observed that if from شاط as signifying “ it burned,”
or “ became burnt,” it is proper; but if from the
same in any of the other senses mentioned above,
it is tropical: and if belonging to this art., it is
imperfectly decl., being of the measure فَعْلَان:
(S in art. شطن, in which see it:) [but in the
Kur-án it is always perfectly decl.: and SM says
that] it is perfectly decl., unless used as a proper
name; in the latter case being imperfectly decl.
(TA.)
شِيَاطٌ The smell of a piece of cotton burning, or
burnt. (S, K.)
-A2-  See also مِشْيَاطٌ.
شَائِطٌ and شَاطٍ, like هَائِرٌ and هَارٍ, [the latter being
formed by transposition from the former, شَاطٍ and
هَارٍ being for شَاطِىٌ and هَارِىٌ,] Flesh-meat [&c.]
burning, or being burnt. (TA.)
تَشْيِيطٌ Flesh-meat roasted, (K,) or made good,
and roasted, (TA,) for a company of men: (K:)
a subst., like تَمْتِينٌ. (K, TA.) [In the CK, for
اِسْمٌ كَالتَّمْتِينِ, we find واسمٌ كالتَّمْتِينِ.]
مِشْيَاطٌ (tropical:)  A she-camel that quickly becomes fat:
(As, S, A, K:) applied also to a he-camel: (TA:)
pl. مَشَايِيطُ; (S, K;) in some of the copies of the
S, مَشَايِطُ: and you say also ↓ إِبِلٌ شياط [app. a
mistake for مِشْيَاطٌ, which is fem., like إِبِلٌ, as well
as masc.]: AA says that مشايط, [or مَشَايِيطُ,]
applied to camels, signifies assigned for slaughter;
from شَاطَ said of a person's blood. (TA.)
مُسْتَشِيطٌ (tropical:)  A fat camel. (K.) [See 10.] ―
