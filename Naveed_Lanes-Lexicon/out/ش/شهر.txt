شَهْرٌ The new moon, when it appears: (IF, A,
Mgh, O, Msb, K:) so called because of its conspicuousness. (Mgh, Msb.) This is the original
signification. (Mgh.) [See the last sentence of
this paragraph.] You say, رَأَيْتُ الشَّهْرَ, meaning
I saw the new moon of the month. (Mgh.)
Hence it is said in a trad., صُومُوا الشَّهْرَ, meaning
Fast ye the first day of the lunar month. (Lh,
TA.) And hence the trad., إِنَّمَا الشَّهْرُ تِسْعٌ وَعِشْرُونَ,
meaning The utility of watching for the new
moon is on the nine and twentieth night. (L,
TA.) [Or the meaning is, that the lunar month
is a period of nine and twenty nights.] ―
-b2-  Also
The moon: or the moon when conspicuous, and
near to being full. (K.) ―
-b3-  And [A lunar month;]
a certain well-known number of days: so called
because made manifest by the moon: (ISd, K:)

(Msb;) and so called because of its being manifest: (Msb, TA:) pl. [of pauc.] أَشْهُرٌ (Msb, K)
and [of mult.] شُهُورٌ. (S, Msb, K.) The following

[to which the epithet الحَرَامُ is often added]:
2. صَفَرٌ [to which the epithet الخَيْرُ is often added]:
3. رَبِيعٌ الأَوَّلُ: 4. رَبِيعٌ الآخِرُ [or الثَّانِى]: 5.

epithet المُبَارَكُ is appropriated]: 10. شَوَّالٌ [to
which the epithet المُكَرَّمُ is frequently added]:
11. ذُو القَعْدَةِ: and 12. ذُو الحِجَّةِ: [see the second

[But authors differ respecting some of these names,
as will be seen in other articles.]) أَشْهُرٌ مَعْلُومَاتٌ,
said, in the Kur [ii. 193], to be the period of the
pilgrimage, for by الحَجُّ, which immediately
precedes, is meant وَقْتُ الحَجِّ, (Mgh, Msb,) or
زَمَانُ الحَجِّ, (Msb,) applies to Showwál and Dhul-Kaadeh and ten days of Dhu-l-Hijjeh, (Mgh,
Msb,) accord. to Aboo-Haneefeh (Mgh) and
most of the learned, part of Dhu-l-Hijjeh being
called a month tropically, as is often done by the
Arabs in similar cases, relating to time; for ex.
when they say, مَا رَأَيْتُهُ مُذْ يَوْمَانِ, the period of
separation having been a day and a part of a day:
(Msb:) or [and] nine days of Dhu-l-Hijjeh with the
night preceding the day of the sacrifice, accord. to
Esh-Sháfi'ee: (Mgh:) or [and] all Dhu-l-Hijjeh,
accord. to Málik: (Mgh, Msb:) [in these two explanations the two months next preceding being
meant to be included:] or Showwál and Dhu-l-
Kaadeh and Dhu-l-Hijjeh and Moharram, accord.
to Aboo-'Amr Esh-Shaabee. (Msb.) ―
-b4-  Also (assumed tropical:)  A
learned man: (O, K:) [because of his celebrity:]
pl. شُهُورٌ. (O, TA.) ―
-b5-  [And accord. to the K, it
signifies also The like of a nail-paring: but this
is app. a mistake, perhaps originating from a
mutilated transcript of what here follows:] a poet
says, describing camels,
أَبْدَأْنَ مِنْ نَجْدٍ عَلَى ثِقَةٍ
وَالشَّهْرُ مِثْلُ قُلَامَةِ الظُّفْرِ
[They went forth from Nejd in a state of confidence, the new moon being like the nail-paring].
(O.)
شُهْرَةٌ a subst. from الاِشْتِهَارُ, (Mgh,) signifying

good sense]. (A.) And صَارَ شُهْرَةً, (K in art. دول,)

a man. (TK in that art.)
بِرْذَوْنٌ شِهْرِىٌّ A برذون [or hackney] between the
رَمَكَة [or mare of mean breed] and the horse of
generous breed: one says, لَمْ يَرْكَبِ الشِّهْرِيَّةَ and
الشَّهَارِىَ [He did not ride hackneys of the sort
above mentioned]: (A:) or شِهْرِيَّةٌ signifies بَرَاذِين
[or hackneys]; and its pl. is شَهَارٍ: (Mgh:) or a
sort of بَرَاذِين [or hackneys]; (Lth, O, K;) a
horse of which the dam is Arabian but not the
