شقح1
شَقَحَ النَّخْلُ, and ↓ شقّح, The palm-trees
were, or became, goodly with their fruit. (TA.)
[See also 4.]
-A2-  شَقَحَ اللّٰهُ فُلَانًا, [inf. n. شَقْحٌ,]
accord. to AZ, is syn. with قَبَحَهُ اللّٰهُ [i. e. God
removed such a one far from good, or prosperity,
&c.; or may God remove &c.]: (TA:) [or, as
may be inferred from what follows, the former of
these verbs is used by some as an imitative sequent to the latter of them:] and accord. to Sb,
(TA,) شَقُحَ, (K, TA,) inf. n. [شُقْحٌ and] شَقَاحَةٌ,
(TA,) is syn. with قَبُحَ [i. e. He, or it, was, or
became, bad or evil, foul or ugly, &c.]: (K, TA:)
[but in this case also it seems that the former of
these verbs may be used by some as an imitative
sequent to the latter of them: for] one says,
قَبْحًا لَهُ وَشَقْحًا [May removal far from good, or
prosperity, &c., betide him], (S, O, K,) in which
شَقْحًا is an imitative sequent to قَبْحًا, or syn.
therewith; (S, K;) and [in like manner] قُبْحًا
لَهُ وَشُقْحًا; (O, K;) and, of a man, قَبُح وَشَقُحَ,
inf. n. of the latter as above and in like manner of
the former; (S;) and جَآءَ بِالقَبَاحَةِ وَالشَّقَاحَةِ [He
did, or said, what was bad or evil, &c.]: (K:)
and ↓ هُوَ قَبِيحٌ شَقِيحٌ [He is bad or evil, foul or
ugly, &c.]: (S, * O, K: *) and ↓ قَعَدَ مَقْبُوحًا مَشْقُوحًا
[He sat, or remained, far removed from good, or
prosperity, &c.]: in like manner: (K:) but Sb
intimates that ↓ شَقيِحٌ is not an imitative sequent,
by his stating that the Arabs say شَقِيحٌ وَذَمِيمٌ
[Bad, or evil, &c., and blamed, &c.; or, more
probably, شَقِيحٌ وَدَمِيمٌ, meaning foul and ugly]:
(L, TA:) and [it is said that] ↓ شَقِيحٌ signifies
Recovering (نَاقِهٌ [for which Freytag appears to
have read نَاقَة]) from disease; (O, K, TA;) and
hence one says, فُلَانٌ قَبِيحٌ شَقِيحٌ [as though
meaning Such a one is unsightly, being just
recovering from disease]: (TA:) and accord. to
AZ, ↓ مَشْقَوحٌ is [not an imitative sequent, but]
syn. with مَقْبُوحٌ: (L, TA:) in the phrase abovementioned, مَشْقُوحًا is said in the 'Ináyeh to mean
broken: or far removed: (TA:) or it means
reviled. (O.)
-A3-  [As indicated above,] شَحَقَهُ,
aor.
شَقَحَ, (Lh, O, K,) inf. n. شَقْحٌ, (Lh, O,) also
signifies He broke it. (Lh, O, K.) One says,
لَأَشْقَحَنَّكَ شَقْحَ الجَوْزَةِ بِالجَنْدَلِ, i. e. I will assuredly break [or crush] thee [as in the breaking
of the walnut] with stones: (O, TA: *) or I will
assuredly extract all that thou hast [as in the
extracting of the contents of the walnut by
means of stones]: for شَقَحَ الجَوْزَةَ, inf. n. as
above, means He extracted what was in the
walnut. (TA.)

اشقح النَّخْلُ; (S, A, Mgh, O, K;) as also
↓ شقّح, (S, * A, Mgh, O,) inf. n. تَشْقِيحٌ; (S;) i. q.
أَزْهَى [meaning The palm-trees showed redness, or
yellowness, in their fruit]: (S, A, O, K:) or their
dates became altered from greenness to yellowness:
(Mgh:) the former is said by As to be of the
dial. of El-Hijáz: and ↓ the latter verb is also
said of the [kind of tree called] أَرَاك, meaning it
became coloured in its fruit. (TA.) And اشقح

selling of dates before their becoming in this
state. (S, * A, * O, TA.)

him far away. (O, K. *)
-A3-  أَقْبِحْ بِهِ وَأَشْقِحْ [app.
How foul, or ugly, or the like, is he! as seems to
be shown by what here follows]: IDrd cites,
أَقْبِحْ بِهِ مِنْ وَلَدٍ وَأَشْقِحْ
مِثْلُ جُرَىِّ الكَلْبِ لَا بَلْ أَقْبَحْ
[How foul is he, as offspring, and how ugly!
like the little whelp of the dog; nay, rather, more
foul!]. (O.)
شُقْحٌ [and inf. n. of شَقُحَ, q. v. ―
