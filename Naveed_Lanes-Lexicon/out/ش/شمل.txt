شَرًّا ↓ أَشْمَلَهُمْ [means] عَمَّهُمْ بِهِ [i. e. he, or it,
included them in common, in general, or universally, with, or by, evil]: (K:) but one should not
say, اشملهم خَيْرًا. (TA.) [Whether what precedes,

giving the primary signification of شَمِلَ, is uncertain.] ―

↓ أَشْمَلَت. (O. [In the TA, I find أَشْمَلَت الريح
ذهبت شماليل مثل شَمَّلت: but this, I doubt not,
is a mistranscription of the passage in the O,
which I have here followed; i. e. أَشْمَلَتِ الرِيحُ
هَبَّت شَمالًا مِثل شَمَلَت; or of a similar passage in
which إِذَا هَبَّتْ is put instead of هَبَّتْ alone.])

some say, he wrapped himself with the garment,
and threw [a part of] it upon his left side. (TA.)
[See also 5.] اِشْتِمَالُ الصَّمَّآءِ, which is forbidden
by the Prophet, is, accord. to As, The wrapping
oneself with the garment so as to cover with it his
body, not raising a side thereof in such a manner
that there is in it an opening from which he may
put forth his hand, or arm: (O:) this is also
termed التَّلَفُّعُ: and sometimes one reclines in the
state thus described: (TA:) but A 'Obeyd says,
accord. to the explanation of the lawyers, it is the
wrapping oneself with one garment, not having
upon him another, then raising it on one side and
putting it upon his shoulders: [so says Sgh; and
he adds,] he who explains it thus has regard to
the dislike of one's uncovering himself and exposing to view the pudenda; and he who explains
it as do the lexicologists dislikes one's covering
his whole body for fear of his becoming in a state
in which his respiration would become obstructed
so that he would perish: (O:) or it is one's
covering his whole body with the كِسَآء or with the
إِزَار; (S, Msb;) to which some add, not raising
aught of the sides thereof. (Msb.) [See also art.
صم.] One says also, يَشْتَمِلُ عَلَى السَّيفِ [He
wraps his garment over the sword; or] he covers
the sword with his garment. (S, O.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,
اشتمل عَلَى كَذَا It comprehended, or comprised,
such a thing.] One says, الرَّحِمُ تَشْتَمِلُ عَلَى الوَلَدِ
(assumed tropical:)  The womb comprises [or encloses] the young.
(TA.) [And in like manner one says of a woman,
اشتملت مِنْهُ عَلَى وَلَدٍ (assumed tropical:)  She became with child by
him. And الكِتَابُ يَشْتَمِلُ عَلَى كَذَا وَكَذَا (assumed tropical:)  The
book, or writing, comprises such and such things.
And hence the phrase in grammar, بَدَلُ اشْتِمَالٍ

implication therein.] ―
-b3-  One says also, اشتمل
عَلَيْهِ الأَمْرُ, meaning (tropical:)  The event [such as a misfortune or an evil of any kind beset him, or beset
him on every side, or] encompassed him; (K,
TA;) like as the كِسَآء encompasses the body.
(TA.) ―
-b4-  One says of wine, تَشْتَمِلُ عَلَى العَقْلِ
فَتَمْلِكُهُ وَتَذْهَبُ بِهِ (assumed tropical:)  [It compasses the intellect,
and so takes possession of it, and makes away with
it]: (Ham p. 555:) or تَشْتَمِلُ عَلَى عَقْلِ الإِنْسَانِ
فَتُغَيِّبُهُ (assumed tropical:)  [It compasses the intellect of the man,
and conceals it]; and thus one says of the present
world or its enjoyments (الدُّنْيَا). (TA.) [اشتمل
عَلَى شَىْءٍ often means (assumed tropical:)  He took, or got, possession of a thing; got it, or held it, within his
grasp, or in his possession.] ―
-b5-  [Hence,] one
says, اشتمل عَلَى نَاقَةٍ فَذَهَبَ بِهَا (assumed tropical:)  He mounted a
she-camel and went away with her. (AZ, O.) ―

(Msb,) or فرّق اللّٰه شَمْلَهُ, (S,) i. e. [May God
dissolve, break up, discompose, derange, disorganize, disorder, or unsettle,] their, (Msb,) or
his, (S,) united, or composed, state of affairs;
(S, Msb;) and شَتَّ شَمْلُهُمْ i. e. [May their united,
or composed, state of affairs &c.] become dissolved, broken up, discomposed, &c.: (O, TA:)
and [in the contr. case] one says, جَمَعَ اللّٰهُ شَمْلَهُمْ,
(S, O, Msb, TA,) or شَمْلَهُ, (Mgh,) i. e. [May
God unite, or compose,] their, (S, Msb,) or his,
(Mgh,) disunited, or discomposed, state of affairs
[&c.]. (S, Mgh, Msb.) And ↓ شَمَلٌ signifies the
same: El-Ba'eeth says,
قَدْ يَنْعَشُ اللّٰهُ الفَتَى بَعْدَ عَثْرَةٍ
وَقَدْ يَجْمَعُ اللّٰهُ الشَّتِيتَ مِنَ الشَّمَلْ
[Sometimes, or often, God raises the young man
after a stumble: and sometimes, or often, God
unites, or composes, what is dissolved, or broken
up, of the state of affairs previously united, or
composed]: (S, O:) AZ cites this ex. in his
“ Nawádir: ” (S:) but Aboo-'Omar El-Jarmee
says that he had not heard the word thus except
in this verse: (S, O:) Ibn-Buzurj, however,
cites another verse as presenting an ex. of the
same. (TA.) ―
-b2-  دَخَلَ فِى شَمْلِهَا and ↓ شَمَلِهَا, said
of a he-camel that has become concealed among a
herd of [she-] camels, means He entered amid

has been plucked: but AO used to say that it is
the produce [or spadix] of the male palm-tree,
while not abundant and large. (TA.)

(TA.)
-A3-  And A small quantity (S, K) of dates

applications]; (K;) [or] as meaning a light
quantity of fruit of the palm-tree; (TA;) and the

There is not upon the palm-tree save a small
quantity remaining of its fruit: (S, TA:) or
↓ مَابَقِىَ فِى النَّخْلَةِ إِلَّا شَمَلَةٌ and ↓ شَمَالِيلُ There
remained not upon the palm-tree save somewhat
in a sparse state [of its fruit]: (TA:) and أَصَابَنَا
شَمَلٌ مِنْ مَطَرٍ A small quantity of rain fell upon
us: and رَأَيْتُ شَمَلًا مِنَ النَّاسِ وَالإِبِلِ I saw a
small number of men and of camels. (S.)

the last two expl. by Lth as a كِسَآء having a
sparse villous substance, with which one wraps
himself, smaller than the قَطِيفَة: (TA:) or the
first signifies a small كِسَآء which one wears in
the manner of the إِزَار [or waist-wrapper]: (Msb:)
or with the Arabs it is a مِئْزَر [or waist-wrapper]
of wool or of [goats'] hair, which one wraps
round him: and ↓ مِشْمَلَةٌ, such as is made of two
pieces sewed together, with which a man wraps
himself when he sleeps by night: (Az, TA:) and
this last, accord. to Meyd, signifies a كِسَآء comprising the steel with which one strikes fire, with
the apparatus of this latter: (Har p. 628:) the
pl. of the first is شِمَالٌ (Msb, TA) and شَمَلَاتٌ.
(Msb.) [See also مِشْمَالٌ.] ―
-b2-  [Hence the saying,]
ضَمَّ عَلَيْهِ اللَّيْلُ شَمْلَتَهُ (tropical:)  [The night contracted upon
him its covering of darkness]. (TA.) ―
-b3-  And
أُمُّ شَمْلَةَ (tropical:)  The present world, or its enjoyments;

شَمَلَةٌ: see شَمَلٌ, in two places.
شَمَلٌّ: see شَمَالٌ.
شِمِلٌّ: see شَمْلٌ, near the end of the paragraph.
-A2-  Also, (TA,) and شِمِلَّةٌ; (S, O, K, TA;) the
former applied to a he-camel; (TA;) and the
latter to a she-camel, as also ↓ شِمْلَالٌ and ↓ شِمْلِيلٌ,
(S, O, Msb, K, TA,) which are likewise applied
to a he-camel, (TA,) and ↓ شِمَالٌ; (K;) Light,
active, or agile; (S, O, Msb, K;) or swift. (Msb,
K, TA.) Hence the phrase ↓ طَأْطَأْتُ شِمْلَالِى [I
hastened my light one, or my swift one]: or,
accord. to AA, he means his hand, or arm, called
the شِمَال; [i. e. I lowered my left hand or arm;]
شِمْلَالٌ and شِمَالٌ meaning the same. (S, O.)
شَمَالٌ, (S, O, Msb, K, &c.,) the most common
form of the word, (Msb,) and ↓ شِمَالٌ, [a form
which I think objectionable as likely to cause
confusion, though it is probably the original form,]

(S, O, K, [in one place in the O erroneously
written شَأمَلّ,]) and ↓ شَأْمَلٌ, (S, O, Msb, K,)
which last is formed by transposition, (S, O, Msb,)

and ↓ شَيْمَلٌ and ↓ شَمُولٌ, (O, K,) and ↓ شَمِيلٌ,
(K,) and ↓ شَمَلٌ, (S, O, Msb, K,) and ↓ شَمْلٌ, (S,
Msb, K,) the last said by ISd not to have been
heard except in the poetry of El-Ba'eeth, (TA,)
and ↓ شَمَلٌّ, (MF, TA,) [every one of these] used
as a subst. and as an epithet, (K,) [so that one
says رِيحُ الشَّمَالِ &c. as well as رِيحٌ شَمَالٌ &c.
and شَمَالٌ &c. alone; The north wind: or a
northerly wind:] the wind that is the opposite to
the جَنُوب: (Msb:) the wind that blows from the
direction of the قُطْب [or pole-star]: (S:) or the
wind that blows from the direction of the حِجْر
[which is on what is called the north, but what is
rather to be called the north-west, side of the
Kaabeh]: (M, K:) or the wind that blows from
the direction of the right hand of a person facing
the Kibleh [by which is meant the angle of the
Black Stone; i. e., correctly speaking, from the
north]: (Th, M, K:) or, correctly, the wind that
blows from between the place of sunrise and the
constellation of the Bear (بَنَات نَعْش): or from
between the place of sunrise and the place of
setting of the constellation of the Eagle (النَّسْر
الطَّائِر): (IAar, K:) [i. e. the wind that blows
from some point of the north-east quarter, or
nearly so: but it was probably thus named as
being the wind that blows from the direction of
the شِمَال (or left side) of a person facing the
rising sun; and therefore the north wind or a
northerly wind:] it seldom, or never, blows in the
night: (K:) when it blows for seven days upon
the people of Egypt, they prepare the graveclothes, for its nature is deadly: it is cold and
dry: (TA:) [see also نَكْبَآءُ:] the pl. of شَمَالٌ is
شَمَالَاتٌ (S, O, K) and شَمَائِلُ, which is anomalous,
as though pl. of شَمَالَةٌ: (S, O:) الأَشَامِل also
occurs, coupled with الأَجَانِب, in a verse of Et-
Tirimmáh; and [as أَجَانِبُ is a reg. pl. of أَجْنُبٌ,
which is a pl. of جَنُوبٌ,] ISd thinks that they
formed from شَمْلٌ the pl. أَشْمَلٌ; and then from
this last, the pl. أَشَامِلُ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] one
says, ↓ أَصَبْتُ مِنْ فُلَانٍ شَمَلًا i. e. رِيحًا [(assumed tropical:)  I perceived from such a one an odour, app. meaning a
foul odour]. (TA.)
شِمَالٌ, (S, O, Msb, K, &c.,) applied to one of
the hands or arms, (S, Msb,) The left; contr. of
يَمِينٌ; (S, O, Msb, K;) as also ↓ شِيمَالٌ, (K, TA,
[in the CK, الشَّمال and الشّمال are erroneously
put for الشِّمَال and الشِّيمَال,]) the latter thought by
ISd to be used only by poetic license, for شِمَالٌ,
(TA,) and ↓ شِمْلَالٌ, (AA, S, O, K,) this last not
known to Ks nor to As: (TA:) of the fem.
gender: (S, O, Msb:) pl. [of pauc.] أَشْمُلٌ, (S,
O, Msb, K,) because it is fem., (S, O,) and [of
mult.] شَمَائِلُ, (S, O, Msb, K,) which is anomalous, (S, O,) and شُمُلٌ, and شِمَالٌ like the sing.
(K.) ―

شَمَال disperses the clouds: (TA:) or it means

called the شَمَال blows the clouds, they delay not
to become cleared away, and to depart: (O:) or,
accord. to IAar, it means مَأْخُوذٌ بِهَا ذَاتُ الشِّمَالِ
