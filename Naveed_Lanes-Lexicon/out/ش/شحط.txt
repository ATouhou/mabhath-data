شَحِطَ, aor.
شَحَطَ, (K,) inf. n. شَحَطٌ; (TA;) It was,
or became, distant, or remote: (S, K:) or شَحْطٌ
and شَحَطٌ signify the being distant, or remote, in
all states or circumstances. (TA.) You say,
شَحَطَ المَزَارُ The place of visiting was, or became,
distant, or remote. (S.) And لَا أَنْسَاكَ عَلَى شَحْطِ
الدَّارِ I will not forget thee notwithstanding the
distance of the dwelling. (TA.) And El-'Ajjáj
says,
وَالشَّحْطُ قَطَّاعُ رَجَآءِ مَنْ رَجَا
[And distance is the severer of the hope of him
who hopeth]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  شَحَطَ فِى السَّوْمِ He went
far, or far from what was right, and exceeded
the due limit, in the demanding of a price. (TA.)
―
-b3-  Hence, (TA,) شَحَطَ البَعِيرَ فِى السَّوْمِ, (K,

(K:) and شَحِطَ signifies the same; (K;) or is
thought to do so by ISd. (TA.) Hence, also, what
is said in a trad., by Rabee'ah, respecting a man
emancipating a portion of a slave: يَكُونُ عَلَى
المُعْتِقِ قِيمَةُ أَنْصِبَآءِ شُرَكَآئِهِ يُشْحَطُ الثَّمَنُ ثُمَّ يُعْتِقُ
كُلَّهُ [The value of the portions of his copartners
shall be imposed upon the emancipater;] the
price of the slave shall be carried to the utmost;
[then he shall emancipate the whole of him:] or
the meaning is, the price of the slave shall be
collected; from شَحَطَ الإِنَآءَ, which see below.

-b2-  شَوَاحِطُ الأَوْدِيَةِ,

شَوْحَطٌ Certain trees, (K,) a species of the trees
of the mountains, (S,) meaning of the mountains
of the سَرَاة, [the mountain-range extending from
near 'Arafát to Nejrán in El-Yemen,] for there
they grow, (TA,) of which bows are made: (S,
K:) AHn says, One acquainted with [the kind
of trees called] the شوحط has informed me that
it grows in the manner of the أَرْز [or pine-tree],
many rods growing from one stem; its leaves
are thin and long, and it has a fruit like the long
grape, [the word here rendered “ grape ” is عنبة,
but it has been altered in the MS., and may
therefore be incorrect,] except that its extremity
is more slender, and it is soft, and is eaten:
(TA:) or i. q.  نَبْعٌ: (IB:) or a species of the
نَبْع, (K,) of which bows are made: (TA:) or
the شوحط and نبع and شِرْيَان are one; the name
varying according to the excellence of their places of
growth; what is upon the summit of the mountain
being called نبع; what is upon its base, or foot,
or lowest or lower part, شريان; and what is in
the depressed tract by its base, شوحط: (Mbr,
Az, K:) IB says the same with respect to the
نبع, but that the شوحط is that which is upon the
lowest part of the mountain; and this is confirmed
by what is said by AZ and others: El-Ghanawee
El-Aarábee says, the نبع and شوحط and سَرَآء are
one: as to the شريان, no one holds it to be of the
نبع except Mbr: Aboo-Ziyád says that bows are
made of the شريان, and they are good, but of a
black colour tinged with redness: and AHn says
in one place, that the نبع and شوحط are yellow
in the wood, heavy in the hand; and when they
become old, they become red: (TA:) the n. un. is
with ة. (K.)
