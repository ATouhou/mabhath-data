شأو1
شَأَوْتُ القَوْمَ, (AZ, S,) aor.
شَاُ^َ, (JM, PS,)
or
شَاَ^َ, (Ham p. 786,) inf. n. شَأْوٌ, (AZ, S, K,) I
preceded, or outwent, the people, or party. (AZ,
S, K. *) Accord. to [several of] the copies of the
K, شَآءَهُ i. e. like شَاعَهُ in measure, which is incorrect, [in other copies ↓ شَآءَاهُ, agreeably with
what is said in the S,] signifies He strove, or
contended, with him to precede him, or outgo him:
or he preceded him, or outwent him: but in the
S it is said, شَآءَاهُ, of the measure فَاعَلَهُ, signifies he
strove, or contended, with him to precede him, or
outgo him: and شَآءَهُ like شَأَاهُ, [the former belonging to art. شوأ and] formed by transposition, signifies he preceded him, or outwent him; and both
of these are used by the poet (El-Hárith Ibn-Khálid El-Makhzoomee, TA) in his saying,
مَرَّ الحُدُوجُ وَمَا شَأَوْنَكَ نَقْرَةً
وَلَقَدْ أَرَاكَ تُشَآءُ بِالأَظْعَانِ
this [passage in the S], however, is taken from
what is said by A'Obeyd, in [his work] “ ElGhareeb el-Musannaf,” which is as follows:
شَآءَنِى الأَمْرُ, like شَاعَنِى [in measure], and شَآنِى,
like شَعَانِى, mean the affair, or event, grieved
me; and thus in the verse of El-Hárith Ibn-Khálid, which he cites; and the same is said in
the T on the authority of IAar, who says that
the poet has used two dial. vars.: [accordingly
the verse may be rendered, The camels with their
saddles upon them passed along and they grieved
thee not at all; but I see thee that thou art
grieved by the women borne in the camel-vehicles:]
it is said in the M, شَآءَنِى الشَّىْءُ means the thing
preceded me, or outwent me: and also the thing
grieved me: formed by transposition from شَآنِى,
as is proved by its having no inf. n.: IAar says
that they are two dial. vars. because of his not
being a grammarian. (TA.) [See also 8.]
-A2-
And شَأَوْتُ البِئْرَ, (Lh, TA,) or شأوت مِنَ البِئْرِ, (S,)
inf. n. شَأْوٌ, (K, TA,) I drew forth the earth from
the well: (S, K: *) or I drew forth a basketful of
earth (شَأْوًا) or two basketfuls of earth (شَأْوَيْنِ)
from the well. (Lh, TA.)

شَآءَاهُ: see 1. يُشَاوِى occurs in a verse of
Milhah El-Jarmee, meaning يُسَابِقُ, from شَأْوٌ
meaning طَلَقٌ: one says شَأَاهُ, aor. يَشْأَاهُ, meaning
سَبَقَهُ: but the verb of the measure regularly formed
from الشَّأْوُ is شَآءى; so that يشاوى is formed by
transposition and by the change of the ء into ى.
(Ham p. 786.)

تَشَآءَى مَا بَيْنَهُمَا, (S, K, TA, [in the CK,
erroneously, تَشاوَى,]) like تَشَاعَى [in measure],
(S,) The space between them two became farextending. (S, K.) ―
-b2-  And تشآءى القَوْمُ The people,
or party, became scattered, or dispersed. (S, K.)

اِشْتَأَى He preceded, or outwent: (S, K:)
so says El-Mufaddal. (S.) ―
-b2-  And He gave ear,
hearkened, or listened. (S, K.)
شَأْوٌ The utmost extent, term, limit, point,
reach, or goal. (S, Msb, K.) ―
-b2-  And A heat, or
single run to a goal or limit: so in the saying,
عَدَا شَأْوًا (S) or جَرَى شَأْوًا (Msb) [He (a horse,
TA) ran a heat]. ―
-b3-  And i. q. هِمَّةٌ: thus in the
saying, إِنَّهُ لَبَعِيدُ الشَّأْوِ (assumed tropical:)  [Verily he is far-aiming,
or far-aspiring, in purpose, desire, or ambition]:
(Lh, TA:) and سَأْوٌ is a dial. var. thereof. (TA.)
-A2-  Also A [basket such as is termed] زَبِيل; and
so ↓ مِشْآةٌ: (K:) or ↓ زَبِيل in
which the earth of a well is taken forth; of the
measure of مِشْعَاةٌ; and the pl. is مَشَآء ٍ: (S:) and
شَأْوٌ signifies, (S,) or signifies also, (K,) the earth
that is taken forth from a well (S, K) with the
like of the مِشْآة, (as in a copy of the S,) or such
as fills the مشْآة: (so in another copy of the S
[agreeably with what next follows]:) a زَبِيل of
the earth of a well. (As, T, TA.) ―
-b2-  And hence,
i. e. as being likened to a زبيل of the earth of a
well, (assumed tropical:)  The dung that the he-ass and the she-ass
casts forth: (As, T, TA:) or the dung of the she-camel; (M, K;) but the more approved word is
[سَأْوٌ,] with س. (M, TA.)
-A3-  Also The nose-rein
(زِمَام) of a she-camel. (Lth, K.)
مِشْآةٌ; see the next preceding paragraph, in two
places.
مُشْتَأ ٍ [part. n. of 8, q. v.: ―
-b2-  and] i. q. مُخْتَلِفٌ
[app. as meaning Disagreeing, differing, or discordant]. (TA.)
