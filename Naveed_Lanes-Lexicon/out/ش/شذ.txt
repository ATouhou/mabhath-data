that which is mentioned by the leading writers on
inflection, and the latter anomalous, (TA,) and

Msb, K) and شَذٌّ, (M, L, K,) It (a thing, M, L)

(S, M, A, L, K,) to which it pertained, (M, L,)
or from other things: (Msb:) it (anything) was,
or became, apart, or alone: and he (a man) was,
or became, apart from his companions, or alone:
(Lth, L:) and (assumed tropical:)  he [app. a beast] took fright, and
ran away. (Msb.) You say, شَذَّ عَنْهُ It was, or

speech in respect of analogy, or rule; deviated
from common, or constant, analogy, or rule; was

anomalous, abnormal, or irregular: and it (the
same) deviated from the common, or constant,
course of speech in respect of usage; deviated
from common, or constant, usage; was extraordinary, or exceptional, as to usage; or was unusual: [the verb is used absolutely to express each
of these meanings; the context in general showing
clearly which meaning is intended: the former is
that which is most frequently intended: and] the
former meaning is also expressed by the phrase
شَذَّ فِى القِيَاسِ or عَنِ القِيَاسِ: and the latter, by
the phrase شَذَّ فِى الاِسْتِعْمَالِ. (Mz, 12th نوع.)

اشذّهُ; (S, M, K;) and ↓ شذّذهُ; (K;) and
↓ شَذَّهُ, aor.
شَذُ3َ, only; (M, K;) but As disallows
this last form of the verb; (IJ, L;) He, or it,
caused it to be, or to become, apart, (S, L,) to
fall, or go, or come, out, or forth, from the
generality of things, or the general assemblage,
main body, bulk, or common mass, (S, M, L, K,)
to which it pertained: (M, L:) and the first
signifies he removed it, and put it far away;
namely, a thing: (K:) and he set him, or exposed
him, apart from his companions, or alone: (IJ,
L:) and he scattered, or dispersed, it. (IKtt.)
A poet says,
فَأَشَذَّنِى لِمُرُورِهِمْ فَكَأَنَّنِى
غُصْنٌ لِأَوَّلِ عَاضِدٍ أَوْ عَاصِفِ
[And he, or it, (perhaps meaning fortune,) exposed me apart from my companions, to their
passing by, or by reason of their passing away,
so that I was as though I were a branch that
should become a prey for the first lopper or
stormy wind]. (IJ, L.) And one says of a she-camel, اشذّت الحَصَى She scattered, or dispersed,
the pebbles [with her feet]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  اشذّ also
signifies نَادٍّ ↓ جَآءَ بِقَوْلٍ شَاذٍّ (assumed tropical:)  [He said what
deviated from the common course of speech]. (K,
TA.)
شَذَّان: see شَاذٌّ, in four places.
شِذَّانٌ The [species of lote-tree called] سِدْر. (K.)
شَاذٌّ A thing that is, or becomes, apart, (S, L,
Msb,) and that falls, or goes, or comes, out, or
forth, from the generality of things, general
assemblage, main body, bulk, or common mass,
(S, L,) to which it pertains: (L:) anything apart,
or alone: and a man apart from his companions,
or alone: (Lth, L:) and [app. a beast] taking
fright, and running away: (Msb:) شُذَّانٌ is a pl.
thereof, like as شُبَّانٌ is of شَابٌّ; [and so is شُذَّاذٌ,
agreeably with analogy;] and ↓ شَذَّان is used in
a similar sense, but is an epithet of the measure
فِعْلَان, not a pl. of شَاذٌّ. (L.) مَا يَدَعُ فُلَانٌ شَاذًّا وَلَا
نَادًّا إِلَّا قَتَلَهُ [Such a one does not leave any one
apart from his companions, nor any one taking
fright and running away, but he slays him,] is
said of a courageous man whom no one encounters without his slaying him. (IAar, L.) And
one says شُذَّانُ قَوْمٍ Those, of a people, who have
become apart, or separate, from their companions.
(L, from a trad.) And شُذَّاذُ النَّاسِ Those who are
among a people but do not belong to their tribes
(S, L) nor to their places of abode: (L:) and
those who are scattered, or dispersed, of people;
(A, L;) as also النَّاسِ ↓ شَذَّانُ, (S, L,) and شُذَّانُهُمْ.
(L.) And قَوْمٌ شُذَّاذٌ A people not among their
own tribe nor in their own places of abode: (L,
K: *) or a people among another people, not
among their own tribes nor in their own places of
abode. (M, TA.) And شُذَّاذُ الآفَاقِ The strangers.
(Har p. 352.) And جَاؤُوا شُذَّاذًا They came few
in number. (L, K. *) And الإِبِلِ ↓ شَذَّانُ and
شُذَّانُهَا Those that are scattered, or dispersed, of
the camels. (L.) And شُذَّانُ الحَصَى (M, L) and
الحَصَى ↓ شَذَّانُ (S, IJ, M, L, K) What are scatterred, or dispersed, of pebbles; (S, L, K;) what
have flown about, and become scattered or dispersed, thereof: (M, L:) and in like manner one
says of other things, (L, K,) or of similar things.
(M, L.) ―
-b2-  Applied to a word, form or measure,
construction, or government, it signifies (tropical:)  Deviating from the common, or constant, course of
speech in respect of analogy, or rule; deviating
from common, or constant, analogy or rule;
extraordinary, or exceptional, as to rule; or
anomalous, abnormal, or irregular: such a word,
&c., though itself admitted if agreeable with
common usage, is not taken as an example to be
imitated: also, applied to the same, deviating
from the common, or constant, course of speech in
respect of usage; deviating from common, or
constant, usage; extraordinary, or exceptional, as
to usage; unusual: [used absolutely to express
each of these significations; the context in general
showing clearly which signification is meant: the
former is that which is most frequently intended:]
a word, &c., may be شاذّ in respect of usage but
agreeable with common analogy or rule; as the
pret. of يَذَرُ and يَدَعُ; and the regular phrase
مَكَانٌ مُبْقِلٌ, the epithet more commonly heard
being بَاقِلٌ: and شاذّ in respect of analogy, or rule,
but agreeable with common usage; as أَخْوَصَ
الرِّمْثُ, and اِسْتَصْوَبْتُ الأَمْرَ: and شاذّ in respect of
analogy, or rule, and of usage, together; as ثَوْبٌ
مَصْوُونٌ, and مِسْكٌ مَدْوُوفٌ: (Mz, 12th نوع: [and
the like is said, but less fully, in the Msb:]) the
pl. masc. is شُذَّاذٌ; and pl. fem. شَوَاذُّ. (Mz, ib.)
See 4, last sentence. [See also the contr. مُطَّرِدٌ:
and see شَذَّ, latter part.] ―
-b3-  Applied to a tradition,
(assumed tropical:)  Having a single ascription, attested by a [single]
sheykh, whether he be trustworthy or not: in
the latter case, not accepted: in the former case,
one hesitates respecting it, and does not adduce it
as an argument, or evidence. (KT.)
