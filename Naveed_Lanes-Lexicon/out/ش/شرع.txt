فُلَانٌ يَشْتَرِعُ شِرْعَتَهُ [meaning Such a one
originates, or embraces, or follows, his way of
religion] is similar to the phrases يَفْتَطِرُ فِطْرَتَهُ and
يَمْتَلُّ مِلَّتَهُ; from شِرْعَةُ الدِّينِ and فِطْرَتُهُ and مِلَّتُهُ.
(TA.)
شَرْعٌ, originally an inf. n.: ―
-b2-  then applied as a
name for A manifest, a plain, or an open, track,
or road, or way: ―
-b3-  and then, metaphorically, to
The divine way of religion; so says Er-Rághib;
(TA;) syn. with شَرِيعَةٌ, q. v. (Msb.) ―
-b4-  In the
saying مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ شَرْعِكَ, (so in the K,) or مررت
بِرَجُلٍ شَرْعُكَ مِنْ رَجُلٍ, (so in the S and O, [for
هُوَ شَرْعُكَ,]) with kesr and with damm to the ع [of
شرعك], (TA,) i. e. [I passed by a man] sufficing
thee [as a man], (S, O, K,) the meaning is, of the
sort to which thou directest thyself and which
thou seekest (فِيهِ وَتَطْلُبُهُ ↓ تَشْرَعُ): (S, O:) and the
word in this sense is used alike as sing. and pl.
(S, O, K) and dual, because it is [originally] an
inf. n. (S, O.) You say, شَرْعُكَ هٰذَا [and هٰذَانِ
and هٰؤُلَآءِ] i. e. Sufficient for thee [is this and are
these two and are these]. (S: and the like is said
in the Mgh.) And it is said in a prov.,
شَرْعُكَ مَا بَلَّغَكَ المَحَلَّا
thus correctly, for it is a hemistich; not المَحَلَّ,
as in the S and K; (TA;) i. e. Sufficient travel-ling-provision for thee is that which will cause
thee to reach the place [of alighting] to which thou
repairest: (K, TA:) applied to the case of being
content with little. (S, K.) ―
-b5-  See also شَرَعٌ, in
two places. ―
-b6-  And see شِرْعَةٌ.
شِرْعٌ [in the CK, erroneously, شَرْع,] The like of
a thing; as also ↓ شِرْعَةٌ: (K, TA:) [but the former
is masc. and ↓ the latter is fem.; for] one says,
هٰذَا شِرْعُ هٰذَا This is the like of this; and so هٰذِهِ
هٰذِهِ ↓ شِرْعَةُ: and هٰذَانِ شِرْعَانِ these two are likes.
(S, O, TA.) [The pls., or rather coll. gen. ns. and
pls., following this meaning in the K belong to
شِرْعَةٌ and شَرْعَةٌ in another sense; as is shown by
exs. in the O and TA.]
-A2-  Also The chords of the
بَرْبَط, (O, K, TA,) which is the [Persian] عُود
[or lute]. (TA.) [In this sense, a coll. gen. n.:]
see its n. un. شِرْعَةٌ. ―
-b2-  And hence, as being likened
thereto, (TA,) (tropical:)  The [thong called] شِرَاك of a
sandal. (O, K, TA.) It is related in a trad. that
a man said, إِنِّى أُحِبُّ الجَمَالَ حَتَّى فِى شِرْعِ نَعْلِى
(O, TA) i. e. (tropical:)  [Verily I love elegance, even] in

شَرَعٌ: see شَرِيعَةٌ.
-A2-  One says, النَّاسُ فِى هٰذَا
الأَمْرِ شَرَعٌ and ↓ شَرْعٌ, (S, Msb, K,) the latter a
contraction of the former, (Msb,) allowed by Kr
and Kz, but disallowed by Yaakoob, (IDrst,
TA,) The people are in this affair equals: (S,
Msb, K:) in this sense, used alike as sing. and
pl. and fem. (S, TA) and masc.: (TA:) [of
شَرَعٌ] Az says that it seems to be pl. [or quasi-pl.
n.] of ↓ شَارِعٌ, like as خَدَمٌ is of خَادِمٌ; i. e., [the
phrase means] the people enter into this affair
(يَشْرَعُونَ فِيهِ) together. (TA.) One says also,
النَّاسُ شَرَعٌ وَاحِدٌ and واحد ↓ شَرْعٌ, meaning The
people are one sort. (K.)
شَرْعَةٌ: see the next paragraph, in two places.
شِرْعَةٌ: see شَرِيعَةٌ, in two places. ―

-b2-  Also, (S, O, K,) and ↓ شَرْعَةٌ,
(K,) A string, or chord: (S, O, K, TA:) or such
as is slender: or while continuing stretched upon
the bow; (TA;) and so ↓ شِرَاعٌ; (Lth, O, K;) or
upon the lute; and so ↓ شِرَاعٌ: (TA:) the pl. [or
rather coll. gen. n.] (of ↓ شِرْعَةٌ, S, O, [i. e. of this
n. un. meaning the “ chord of a lute,” as is shown
by exs. in the O and TA,]) is ↓ شِرْعٌ (S, O, K)
and (that of ↓ شَرْعَةٌ, TA) ↓ شَرْعٌ, (O, K, TA,) like
as تَمْرٌ is of تَمْرَةٌ, (O, TA,) and [the pl. properly
so termed] (of شِرْعَةٌ, S, O) شِرَعٌ, and pl. pl. شِرَاعٌ:
(S, O, K:) and the pl. of ↓ شِرَاعٌ as a sing. syn.
with شِرْعَةٌ is شُرُعٌ. (TA.)
شَرَعَةٌ i. q. سَقِيفَةٌ [i. e. A roof, or covering, such
as projects over the door of a house &c.; or a
place roofed over]: pl. أَشْرَاعٌ. (O, K.)
[

or legitimate.]
شُرَاعٌ A plant, or herbage, full-grown, (O, K,
TA,) that satiates the camels. (TA.)

-A2-  The شِرَاعٌ of a ship or
boat (S, Mgh, O, Msb) is called in Pers. بَادْبَان
[i. e. A sail]; (MA, Mgh, KL;) i. q. قِلْعٌ; (MA,
TA;) a thing like a wide مُلَآءَة [q. v.], (O, K,
TA,) of cloth or of matting, (TA,) [raised, or
attached,] upon a piece of wood [i. e. a mast or a
yard]; which is beaten upon by the wind (تُصَفِّقُهُ
الرِّيحُ,) and causes the ship, or boat, to go along:
(O, K, TA:) so called because it is raised (يُشْرَعُ
i. e. يُرْفَعُ) above the ship, or boat: (TA:) pl.
أَشْرِعَةٌ and شُرُعٌ; (O, K;) the former a pl. of pauc.
(O.) ―
-b2-  And hence, as being likened thereto,
(TA, [and the same is implied in the S and O,])
(tropical:)  The neck of a camel. (S, O, K, TA.) Sometimes
they said of a camel, رَفَعَ شِرَاعَهُ, meaning (tropical:)  He
raised his neck: (S, O, TA.) ―
-b3-  One says also
رَجُلٌ شِرَاعُ الأَنْفِ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  A man having the
nose extended, and long. (TA. [See أَشْرَعُ.]) ―

of their thickness, are fit for the sewing of leather

شَرَاعَةٌ Courage; (O, K;) as an attribute of a
man. (O.)
شَرِيعَةٌ and ↓ مَشْرَعَةٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and ↓ مَشْرُعَةٌ
(Msb, K) and ↓ مَشْرَعٌ (TA) and ↓ شَرَعٌ (O, TA *)
and مَآءٍ ↓ شِرَاعُ (TA) A watering-place; a resort
of drinkers [both men and beasts]; (S, O, K,
TA;) a place to which men come to drink therefrom and to draw water, (Msb, * TA,) and into
which they sometimes make their beasts to enter,
to drink: (TA:) but the term ↓ مشرعة, (Az,
Msb,) or شريعة, (TA,) is not applied by the
Arabs to any but [a watering-place] such as is
permanent, and apparent to the eye, (Az, Msb,
TA,) like the water of rivers, (Msb,) not water
from which one draws with the well-rope: (Az,
Msb, TA:) the pl. of شَرِيعَةٌ is شَرَائِعُ; and that of
↓ مَشْرَعَةٌ or ↓ مَشْرَعٌ [or of both] is مَشَارِعُ; which
is also expl. as meaning gaps, or breaches, in the
banks of rivers or the like by which men or beasts
come to water: (TA:) and [in like manner it is
said that] شَرِيعَةٌ signifies a place of descent to
water: (Lth, TA:) or a way to water. (Bd in
v. 52.) ―
-b2-  And hence, (Lth, Kr, Msb, TA, and
Bd ubi suprà,) الشَّرِيعَةُ, (Lth, Kr, S, Msb, K, &c.,)
as also ↓ الشِّرْعَةُ, (Msb, K, &c.,) and ↓ الشَّرْعُ,
(Msb,) signifies likewise الدِّينُ; (Msb, and Bd
ubi suprà;) because it is a way to the means of
eternal life; (Bd ibid.;) or because of its manifestness; (Msb;) [i. e.] The religious law of God;
(Lth, Kr, S, O, K, * TA;) consisting of such ordinances as those of fasting and prayer and pilgrimage (Lth, Kr, TA) and the giving of the poorrate (Kr, TA) and marriage, (Lth, TA,) and
other acts (Lth, Kr, TA) of piety, or of obedience
to God, or of duty to Him and to men: (Kr,
TA:) pl. as above. (Msb.) شَرِيعَةٌ signifies also
[A law, an ordinance, or a statute: and] a
religion, or way of belief and practice in respect
of religion: (Fr, TA:) and a way of belief or
conduct that is manifest (Ibn-'Arafeh, Mgh, K)

شُرَاعِىٌّ, as an epithet applied to A spear-head
and a spear, of Shuráa, (TA,) which was the
name of a certain man who made spear-heads and
spears, (K, TA,) as they assert: but IAar says
that it may be a reg. rel. n. from شُرَاعٌ, or an
irreg. rel. n. from some other name of which the
radical latters are شرع: and [SM says also that,]
applied to a spear, it signifies long: (TA:) or
↓ شِرَاعِىٌّ, thus applied, has this meaning, a rel. n.
[from شِرَاعٌ]. (S, O.) شُرَاعِيَّةٌ and ↓ شِرَاعِيَّةٌ [in the
CK without teshdeed], applied to a she-camel,
signify (tropical:)  Long-necked; (O, K, TA:) thus expl.
by ISh: but Az thinks the latter to be the more
probably correct; the neck being likened to the
شِرَاع of the ship or boat, because of the height
thereof. (O.)
شِرَاعِىٌّ; and its fem., with ة: see the next preceding paragraph.
شَرَّاعٌ A seller of the flax called شَرِيع. (IAar, K.)

TA:) or directing themselves, or repairing,
(شَارِعَاتٌ,) from the deep water to the bank, or

same: (TA:) or شُرَّعًا in the Kur vii. 163, referring to fish, means appearing upon the surface
of the water. (Bd, Jel. *) ―
-b4-  Also, applied to a
place of alighting, or an abode, (مَنْزِلٌ,) Situate

applied to a house (دَارٌ) signifies the same; (K;)
or having its door [opening] upon such a road;

passengers]: (Mgh, * TA:) and دُورٌ شَارِعَةٌ houses
having their doors opening into the streets: or
دُورٌ شَوَارِعُ, as expl. by IDrd, houses upon one open
road. (TA.) It is said in a trad., كَانَتِ الأَبْوَابُ
شَارِعَةً إِلَى المَسْجِدِ The doors were opening towards

-b5-  And Anything near (K,
TA) to a thing, or overlooking it: whence شَارِعَةٌ

or يَشْرَعُ فِيهِ النَّاسُ, Mgh, TA) in common, or in

meaning of مَشْرُوعٌ [or مَشْرُوعٌ فِيهِ]; (Msb;) or as
meaning ذُو شَرْعٍ مِنَ الخَلْقِ [having an entering of people]: (TA:) or it signifies a manifest,
