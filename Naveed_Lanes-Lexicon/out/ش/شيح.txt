شيح1
شَاحَ: see 4. ―
-b2-  [Also, accord. to Freytag,
on the authority of the “ Kitáb el-Addád,” He
was brave, or bold: thus having two contr. significations. ―
-b3-  Another meaning assigned to it by
him, in common with شَايَحَ and أَشَاحَ, as on the
authority of the K, i. e. “ Diligens fuit,” is a mistake.]
2
شيّحهُ, (O,) inf. n. تَشْيِيحٌ, (K,) He cautioned
him; or made him to fear, or be in fear. (O, K. *)

looked at his adversary, or antagonist, and

عَلَى حَاجَتِهِ [for the thing that he wanted]; (K;)
as also ↓ شايح, (S, A, K,) inf. مُشَايَحَةٌ and شِيَاحٌ;
and ↓ شَاحَ: (K:) or he was cautious and in fear,
endeavouring to repel death. (L.) ―
-b2-  But in the
dial. of Hudheyl, (S,) He strove, laboured, toiled,

he turned away his face. (A.) ―
-b5-  اشاح also signifies He advanced, or came forward; syn. أَقْبَلَ.
(Fr, O, TA.) [Thus it has two contr. meanings.
See also the part. n., مُشِيحٌ.] ―
-b6-  And He defended
what was behind his back. (IAth, TA.) [See,
again, the part. n.] ―
-b7-  اشاح بِذَنَبِهِ, said of a horse,
He let his tail hang down loosely. (Lth, S.) F, in
the K, following Az and Sgh, says that this is
a mistranscription of the verb, for اساح; but his
assertion requires proof. (MF.) [See the latter
verb, in art. سيح.]
-A2-  اشاحت الأَرْضُ The land
produced the plant called شِيح. (AHn, O, K.)
شِيحٌ Cautious, or fearing; (A, K;) as also
↓ شَائِحٌ, (A, TA,) and ↓ مُشِيحٌ: (As, O:) or this
last, cautious, or fearing, and at the same time
striving, labouring, toiling, or exerting himself:

of the second also] شِيَاحٌ: (S, O.)
-A2-  Also [The

species of wormwood;] a certain plant, (AHn,
S, A, O, K,) well known, (AHn, O, K,) of several
species, (AHn, O,) of some [species] whereof
brooms are made, (L,) [and which is also used
for fumigation,] the leaves of which are [of the
kind called] هَدَب; (AHn, O, L;) it has a sweet
odour, but its taste is bitter; is pasture for horses
and camels; and the places of its growth are the
plains and the meadows: (AHn, O, L:) pl.
شِيحَانٌ. (Fr, O, L.)
-A3-  Accord. to the K, [probably on the authority of Lth,] it signifies also A
[garment of the kind called] بُرْد, of El-Yemen:
but Az says that there is no kind of garment so
called: the correct word is سَيْحٌ, with [the unpointed] س [and with fet-h]. (TA.)
شَيْحَانُ [and probably with tenween also]: see
شِيحٌ. ―
-b2-  Also Very jealous; (S, O, K;) because
such is cautious for his wives, or women under

↓ شَائِحٌ. (K.) ―

(As, O, K,) Tall: (O, K:) or goodly in tallness.

-b4-  And the former, That makes, or utters, a
low sound in running; [so I render يَتَهَمَّسُ عَدْوًا
in the K and TA; in the O and in my MS. copy
of the K, يَتَهَمَّشُ; but the former I think the
right reading; app. by reason of quickness, or
swiftness; for it is added,] quickness, or swiftness,
is meant thereby: (O, TA: *) mentioned by Az,
on the authority of Khálid Ibn-Jembeh. (TA.)
[In this sense it seems to be with tenween: for]
شَيْحَانَةٌ [is its fem. and] means A quick, or swift,
she-camel. (S, O.) ―
-b5-  Also A horse strong in
spirit; syn. شَدِيدُ النَّفْسِ; (O, K, TA; in the
CK, النَّفَسِ [i. e. in breath];) and so ↓ شِيحَانٌ:
thus expl. by Skr. (O.)
شِيحَانٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in
two places.
شِيَاحٌ Mutual caution or fear. (And The
act of striving, labouring, toiling, or exerting oneself, in anything. (K.) [But in both of these
senses it seems to be an inf. n. of 3, q. v.]
-A2-  Also
(K) Drought, dearth, scarcity. (O, K.)
شَائِحٌ: see شِيحٌ, in two places: ―
-b2-  and see also
شَيْحَانُ.
مُشِيحٌ: see شِيحٌ, in two places. It is also expl.
as meaning Striving, labouring, toiling, or exerting himself, and persevering in his work: (A:)
and striving &c., and hastening, or going quickly.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  Also Advancing, or coming forward, to
one. (Fr, O, K.) ―
-b3-  And Defending what is behind one's back. (Fr, O, K.)
مُشَيَّحٌ is expl. as meaning Striped; applied to
a garment: but Az says that there is no such
word, so applied: the correct word is مُسَيَّحٌ, with
[the unpointed] س. (TA.)
مَشِيحَى: see the following paragraph.
مَشِيحَآء: see the following paragraph.
مَشْيُوحَى: see the following paragraph.
مَشْيُوحَآءُ (S, O, K) and ↓ مَشِيحَى (O, K) A
state of haste: (S, O, K:) or a state of confusion:
(K:) the latter meaning mentioned in the L:
(TA:) you say, هُمْ فِى مَشْيُوحَآءَ مِنْ أَمْرِهِمْ (S, O,
K) and فى مَشِيحَى من امرهم (O, K) They are
in a state of haste in respect of their affair:
(S, O, K:) or in a state of confusion in their
affair: (L, K:) as having the latter meaning,
Ibn-Málik says that it is مَشِيجَآء, with ج and
medd, of the measure فَعِيلَآء, not مَفْعِلَآء; but this
requires consideration: Ibn-Umm-Málik and
others, following AHei, say that ↓ القَوْمُ فِى مَشِيحَآءَ
مِنْ أَمْرِهِمْ means the people, or party, are in a
state of striving, labour, toil, or exertion, and
determination, or resolution, in respect of their
affair. (TA.)
-A2-  مَشْيُوحَآءُ also signifies A land
that produces the plant called شِيح; (S, O, K;)
and so ↓ مَشْيُوحَى: (O, K:) or it signifies many
plants of the kind so called: thus in the T, on the
authority of As and A 'Obeyd, and so says AHn,
as is stated [in the O and] in the R; (TA;)
AHn saying further that it is like مَشْيُوخَآء meaning a company of شُيُوخ [or elderly men], and
مَعْيُورَآء meaning a herd of عُيُور [or asses], &c.;
(O;) [so that it is a quasi-pl. n.;] but this is
disallowed by El-Mufaddal Ibn-Selemeh. (TA.)
