شغل1
شَغَلَهُ, (S, O, Msb, K,) aor.
شَغَلَ, (O, K, MS,)
inf. n. شَغْلٌ (Msb, K) and شُغْلٌ, (K,) the latter
on the authority of Sb, (TA,) He, or it, (a man,
S, or an affair, Msb,) busied him, occupied him,
or employed him; (K;) i. q. أَلْهَاهُ [signifying as
above; and particularly he, or it, busied him, &c.,
so as to divert him from (عَنْ) something; or
diverted him from a thing by busying him, &c.]:
(S and Msb and K in art. لهو, and Bd and Jel in
xv. 3, &c.:) [↓ شغّلهُ signifies he, or it, busied
him, &c., much; i. e.] with teshdeed it denotes
muchness: (Bd in xlviii. 11:) ↓ اشغلهُ is a good
dial. var. of شَغَلَهُ; or is rare; or bad: (K:)
accord. to IDrd [and J], (O,) one should not say
أَشْغَلْتُهُ; (S, O;) for it is bad: (S:) accord. to IF,
they scarcely ever say أَشْغَلْتُ, [thus in the O, but
in the Msb ↓ اِشْتَغَلَ,] but it is allowable: (O:)
none of the leading lexicologists is known to have
pronounced it good. (TA.) [Hence the saying,
شَغَلَتْ سَعَاتِى جَدْوَاىَ (see art. سعو and سعى),
or, as some relate it, شغلت شِعَابِى جدواى (see
art. شعب).] See another ex. voce شَاغِلٌ. One
says also شُغِلَ بِهِ, (Msb, K,) meaning تَلَهَّى [i. e.
He was, or became, busied, &c., by it], (Msb,)
and به ↓ اشتغل [meaning the same]; (Az, Msb,
K;) and شُغِلْتُ عَنْكَ بِكَذَا [I was, or became,
busied, &c., so as to be diverted from thee, by such
a thing], (S, O,) and ↓ اِشْتَغَلْتُ [in the same
sense]: (S:) and عَنْهُ ↓ تشاغل, (TA,) which likewise signifies تَلَهَّى [meaning as expl. above, or
he busied himself, &c., so as to divert himself
from him, or it]: (TA in art. لهو, and Bd and
Jel in lxxx. 10:) some disallow ↓ اِشْتَغَلَ, in the
form of an active verb, but say اُشْتُغِلَ, in the form
of a pass. verb; but it is originally quasi-pass of
أَشْغَلْتُهُ, like as are اِحْتَرَقَ and اِكْتَهَلَ of أَحْرَقْتُهُ
and أَكْهَلْتُهُ; [though why of أَشْغَلْتُهُ rather than
of شَغَلْتُهُ, I do not see:] Az mentions the usage
of its act. and pass. part. ns.: (Msb:) accord. to
AHát and IDrd, one should not say ↓ اِشْتَغَلَ;
but IF mentions, as transmitted from the Arabs,
اُشْتُغِلَ فُلَانٌ بِالشَّىْءِ, and the pass. part. n. (O.)
―
-b2-  One says also, نَحْنُ نَشْغَلُ عَنْكَ المَرْتَعَ (assumed tropical:)  [We
occupy the place of pasturage so as to keep it
from thee], and المَآءَ [the water]; meaning, it is
sufficient for us without being more than sufficient.
(S in art. شفه.) And شُغِلَ عَنْكَ مَا عِنْدَنَا (assumed tropical:)  [What
we had was employed so as to be kept from thee].
(JK in that art.)

شَغَّلَ see the preceding paragraph.
4
اشغلهُ: see 1. ―
-b2-  مَا أَشْغَلَهُ [meaning How
much is he busied! &c.], (Th, S, K,) denoting
wonder, (Th, TA,) is anomalous, because one
does not [regularly] form a verb of wonder from
one in the form of a pass. verb. (Th, S, K.)
6
تشاغل عَنْهُ: see 1. [Accord. to Golius,
تشاغلوا signifies They occupied one another, on
the authority of the KL; in which, however, I
find only تَشَاغُلٌ expl. as meaning خودرا بچيزى
مشغول كردن i. e. To make oneself busied, &c.,
with a thing.]
8
إِشْتَغَلَ see 1, in five places. ―
-b2-  One says also,
اِشْتَغَلَ فِيهِ السَّمُّ The poison crept into him, or
pervaded him; syn. سَرَى: and اشتغل فِيهِ الدَّوَآءُ
The medicine entered into him, and produced an
effect upon him, or showed its effect upon him;
syn. نَجَعَ. (TA.)
شَغْلٌ an inf. n. of 1. (K, Msb.) See the next
paragraph.
-A2-  And see also شَغْلَةٌ.
شُغْلٌ and ↓ شَغْلٌ and ↓ شُغُلٌ (S, O, Msb, K)
and ↓ شَغَلٌ (S, O, K;) Business, occupation, or
employment; (PS;) contr. of فَرَاغٌ: (K:) [and
particularly business, &c., that diverts one from a
thing:] or an occurrence that causes a man to
forget, or neglect, or be unmindful: (Er-Rághib,
TA:) pl. [of pauc.] أَشْغَالٌ (S, O, K) and [of
mult.] شُغُولٌ: (K:) شُغْلٌ is mentioned by Sb as
an instance of an inf. n. having a pl., namely,
أَشْغَالٌ; like عَقْلٌ and مَرَضٌ. (TA in art. مرض.)
[See also أُشْغُولَةٌ.]
شَغَلٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
شَغِلٌ Busy, or busied, occupied, or employed:
(K:) [and particularly busy, &c, so as to be
diverted from a thing:] thought by ISd to be a
possessive epithet [meaning ذُو شُغْلٍ], because it
has no verb to which it is conformable: (TA:)
it is an epithet applied to a man, from الشَّغْلُ [or
الشُّغْلُ]: (IAar, in O:) and ↓ مَشْغُولٌ signifies the
same; (Msb, TA;) and ↓ مُشْتَغِلٌ (Az, Msb, K)
and ↓ مُشْتَغَلٌ, (Az, IF, O, Msb, K,) the latter
[said to be] extr. [meaning anomalous, for
اُشْتُغِلَ is not mentioned by F]. (K.)
شُغُلٌ: see شُغْلٌ.
شَغْلَةٌ Reaped grain or wheat, collected together,
in the place where it is trodden out; syn. بَيْدَرٌ
and كُدْسٌ (IAar, O, K) and عَرَمَةٌ; (IAar, O;)
as also ↓ شَغَلَةٌ: (IAth, TA:) pl. [or coll. gen. n.]
of the former ↓ شَغْلٌ, (O, K, TA, [in the CK,
erroneously, شُغَلٌ,]) like as تَمْرٌ is of تَمْرَةٌ. (O,
TA.)
شَغَلَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.
شَغَّالٌ signifies كَثِيرُ الشُّغْلِ [i. e. Having much
business or occupation or employment; or who
busies or occupies or employs himself much].
(TA.)
شَاغِلٌ act. part. n. of شَغَلَهُ; [Busying, occupying, or employing; &c.;] (S, Msb;) applied to a
man, (S,) or to an affair. (Msb.) [Hence,] one
says, عَنْكَ الشَّوَاغِلُ ↓ شَغَلَتْنِى [Busying affairs
busied me, or have busied me, so as to divert me
from thee]: the last word being pl. of شَاغِلٌ.
(TA.) شُغْلٌ شَاغِلٌ [lit. Busying business, or the
like,] has an intensive meaning: (K:) the latter
word in this case is a corroborative, as in لَيْلٌ
لَائِلٌ. (S.)
أَشْغَلُ [More, and most, busy &c.]. أَشْغَلُ مِنْ
ذَاتِ النِّحْيَيْنِ [More busy than she who was the
owner of the two skins of butter] is a prov. [mentioned in the TA]: she was a woman of [the
tribe of] Teym-Allah: she used to sell clarified
butter, in the Time of Ignorance; and Khowwát
Ibn-Jubeyr El-Ansáree came to her, demanding
to buy clarified butter of her, and saw no one
with her, and he bargained with her: so she
untied a skin, and he looked at it: then he said
to her, “Hold thou it until I look at another: ”
and she said, “Untie thou another skin: ” and he
did so, and looked at it, and said, “I desire
other than this; therefore hold thou it: ” and she
did so: and when her hands were [thus] occupied,
he assaulted her, and she was unable to repel the
him. (Meyd.)
أُشْغُولَةٌ an instance of the measure أُفْعُولَةٌ from
الشُّغْلُ [similar to أُلْهُوَّةٌ and أُلْهِيَّةٌ, and to أُلْعُوبَةٌ,
&c.; app. meaning A thing with which one is
busied, &c.: and also syn. with شُغْلٌ]. (O, K.)
مَشْغَلَةٌ A thing that causes one to be busied,
&c.: (K, * TA:) pl. مَشَاغِلُ. (TA.)

1
شَغِىَ, aor.
1َ2َ3َ, inf. n. شَغًا, [signifies accord.
to some] He (a man) had a tooth, or teeth,
exceeding the other teeth: and [accord. to others,
agreeably with what is said to be the right
meaning of شَاغِيَة below,] he had a tooth, or
teeth, differing in the manner of growth from the
other teeth. (S.) [And] شَغِيَتِ السِّنُّ, aor.
1َ2َ3َ; (Msb,
K;) and شَغَت, aor.
1َ2ُ3َ; (K;) inf. n. (of the former,
Msb, TA) شَغًا (Msb, K, TA) and [of the latter]

(TA;) [accord. to some] The tooth exceeded the
other teeth: (Msb:) and [accord. to others]
(Msb) the tooth differed from the other teeth
(Msb, K, TA) in an absolute sense, (TA,) or in
respect of its place of growth, (Msb,) or in its
manner of growth, in length, and shortness, and
receding, and projecting: (K, TA:) or, accord. to
the A, شَغًا signifies the differing in respect of the
manner of growth and of collocation: or the
upper teeth's not falling upon the lower: (TA:)
or, as IF says, the advancing of the upper teeth
beyond the lower. (Msb.) The epithet applied
to a man is ↓ أَشْغَى; and to a woman, شَغْوَآءُ; and

↓ شَاغِيَةٌ; (S, Msb;) which last is said by Az to
have two meanings; one whereof is exceeding [the
other teeth]; and the other, being longer and
larger, and differing in respect of the place [or
more probably the manner] of its growth from
those next to it: (Msb:) or, accord. to a marginal
note in the S, in the handwriting of Aboo-Zekereeyà, this signifies differing in the manner of
its growth from the manner of growth of the
others, whether exceeding or not exceeding: or,
accord. to a marginal note in the copy of Aboo-Sahl El-Harawee, crooked; not exceeding. (TA.)
