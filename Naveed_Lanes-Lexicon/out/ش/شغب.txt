شغب1
شَغَبَ عَلَيْهِمْ, (S, A, Msb, K,) and بِهِمْ, (S,
Msb, K,) and فِيهِمْ, (TA,) and شَغَبَهُمْ, (S, Msb,
K,) aor.
شَغَبَ, (A, Msb, K,) inf. n. شَغْبٌ, (S, * A, * K, *
TA,) with which شَغَبٌ is syn., (A, K,) a syn. sometimes used, (A,) or this latter is not allowable, (S,
K,) as some say, (K,) and is ascribed by IAth to the
vulgar, and said by El-Hareeree in the “ Durrat
el-Ghowwás ” to be a mistake, but IB says in the
commentaries on the “ Durrah ” that it is correct,
mentioned by IDrd, and MF says that it is
mentioned by IJ, as well as by Z in the A;
(TA;) and one says also شَغِبَ عليهم, [and it
seems to be implied that one says likewise شَغِبَ
بهم, and شَغِبَهُمْ,] aor. as above, (S, K,) inf. n.
شَغَبٌ; (S, TA;) but this latter form of the verb,
with kesr, is of weak authority; (S, * TA;)
[whence it seems that شَغَبٌ is correct as inf. n. of
شَغِبَ, but disallowed by some who knew not this
form of the verb;] He excited, or stirred up, (S,
A, Msb, K, TA,) [against them, or] among them,
(Msb,) evil, or mischief, (S, A, Msb, K, TA,) and
conflict, faction, sedition, or discord, and contention, or altercation, and opposition: (TA:) and [it
is said that] تَشْغِيبٌ is like شَغْبٌ signifying the exciting, or stirring up, evil, &c.; (K, TA;) [but]
↓ شغّب, inf. n. تَشْغِيبٌ, signifies he excited, or
stirred up, evil, &c., much, or often. (O.) A trad.
mentioned in [the first paragraph of] art. شعب is
quoted by IAth thus: مَا هٰذِهِ الفْتْيَا الَّتِى شَغَبَتْ
فِى النَّاسِ [What is this judicial decision which
has excited evil, &c., among the people?]. (TA.)
―
-b2-  [See also شَغْبٌ below.] ―
-b3-  The saying of
'Amr Ibn-Kameeäh,
فَإِنْ تَشْغِبِى فَالشَّغْبُ مِنِّى سَجِيَّةٌ
means (tropical:)  And if thou oppose, or contravene, me,
and do that which is not agreeable to me, [know
that opposition, &c., is a natural disposition of
mine; عَلَىَّ being understood after تشغبى, as appears from what here follows.] (TA. [See also
3, and 6.]) Accord. to El-Báhilee, ذَاتُ شَغْبٍ
[applied to a she-ass] means (tropical:)  Having the quality
of opposing or contravening [the male]: so in
the saying of El-'Ajjáj,
كَأَنَّ تَحْتِى ذَاتَ شَغْبٍ سَمْحَجَا
قَوْدَآءَ لَا تَحْمِلُ إِلَّا مُخْدَجَا
(tropical:)  [As though beneath me were a she-ass] such as
opposes or contravenes [the male], long-bodied,
long-necked, [that would not bear in her womb
aught save a fœtus imperfectly formed;] meaning, لَا تُؤَاتِبهِ وَتَشْغَبُ عَلَيْهِ [i. e. that she (the
beast that he was riding) would not comply with
his desire, and was contravening him]. (TA.)
[Accord. to J,] ذَاتُ شَغْبٍ وَضِغْنٍ, [in the TA
وصغب, and so in a copy of the A, an evident
mistranscription,] applied to a she-ass that has
not conceived during a year or two years or some
years, means (tropical:)  Refractory, or incompliant, to
the strong, or bulky, male. (S: there expl. by the
words إِذَا وَحِمَتْ وَاسْتَصْعَبَتْ عَلَى الجَأْبِ [which
have been misunderstood by Golius, and rendered by him, and by Freytag after him, as applied to a woman, and meaning respuens maris
congressum, aut picâ laborans].) ―
-b4-  And شَغَبَ
signifies also (assumed tropical:)  He declined, or deviated, from the
right way or course: (Sh, TA:) or شَغَبَ عَنِ
الطَّرِيقِ, aor.
شَغَبَ, (K,) inf. n. شَغبٌ, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  He
declined, or deviated, from the road or way. (K.)

شاغبهُ, (S, A, K, TA,) inf. n. مُشَاغَبَةٌ and
شِغَابٌ, (TA,) He acted with him in an evil
manner; treated him with enmity, or hostility;
contended in altercation with him; or did evil to
him, obliging him to do the like in return: (A,
K, TA:) he opposed, or contravened, him. (TA.)
6
طَلَبْتُ مِنْهُ كَذَا فَتَشَاغَبَ وَامْتَنَعَ (tropical:)  I sought,
or demanded, of him such a thing, and he manifested incompliance (تَعَاصَى), and refused. (A,
TA.)

cries or shouts or noises: (Ham p. 505:) or much
clamour and confused or indistinct speech, leading,
or conducing, to evil, or mischief. (Har p. 311.)
One says شَغْبُ الجُنْدِ [The clamour, &c., of the
army]. (S, and Ham ubi suprà.) ―
-b3-  [Hence,
app., this word, or the next, is used by some postclassical writers as signifying The plaintive cry of
the بُلْبُل. (See De Sacy's Chrest. Ar., sec. ed.,
iii. 500 — 502.)]
