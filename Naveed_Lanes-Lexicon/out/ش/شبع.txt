order that he may be thought to be a devotee, not
being so: or, as some say, the person who wears
a shirt to the sleeves of which he attaches two
other sleeves in order to make it appear that he
is wearing two shirts: or [the wearer of the garments of the false witness; for] it is said that
there used to be in the tribe the man of goodly
exterior, and when false witness was needed, he
bore [such] witness, and was not rejected, because
of the goodliness of his apparel. (Mgh.) [See
also art. زور, in which this trad, is cited with a
small variation.]
