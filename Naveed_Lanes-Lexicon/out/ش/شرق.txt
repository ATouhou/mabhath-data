these days were so called because the flesh of the
victims was therein cut into strips, and dried in
the sun, or spread in the sun to dry: (S, M, Mgh,
O, Msb, K: *) or because the victims were not
sacrificed until the sun rose: (IAar, S, O, K:) or
from the prayer of the day of sacrifice, which
they follow: (Mgh:) or because they used to say,
[on that day,] (S, M, O,) in the Time of Ignorance, (M,) ثَبِيرْ كَيْمَا نُغِيرْ ↓ أَشْرِقْ, (S, M, O,)
which means Enter thou upon the time of sunrise, Thebeer, (addressing one of the mountains
of Mekkeh, M, * Mgh,) that we may push, or

Haneefeh used to hold that التَّشْرِيق means التَّكْبِير
[i. e. the saying اَللّٰهُ أَكْبَرْ]; but none beside him
has held this opinion. (TA.) It is said in a trad.

[There are three things, with the beauty of which
the world is made to shine; the sun of the bright
early morning, and Aboo-Is-hák, and the moon]:
but there is no proof in this, because [the right
reading may be تُشْرِقُ, and so] الدنيا may be an
agent; therefore the making the verb trans. [in
this sense] is said to be post-classical, though it is
mentioned by the author of the Ksh. (MF, TA.)
―
-b3-  It signifies also He entered upon the time of

come to thee every day that the sun rises: or, as
some say, شَارِقٌ signifies the upper limb (قَرْن) of
the sun: (M:) and one says, لَا آتِيكَ مَا ذَرَّ شَارِقٌ

O, TA.) And also The place of sunrise and the
place of sunset; [or the east and the west;] (M,
O;) the former being thus made predominant
because it denotes existence, whereas the latter

at El-Azárik (a certain water in the بَادِيَة, TA
in art. زرق)], Keep thou [to pure milk, and] to
the sun [or the places of sunshine] in winter: but
[ISd says,] in my opinion, المَشَارِق is here pl. of
↓ مُشَرَّقٌ applied to flesh-meat that is “ [cut into
strips and] spread in the sun [to dry]; ” and this
is confirmed by his saying بالمحض, each of them
being food. (M.)
مُشْرِقٌ: see شَرِقٌ. ―
