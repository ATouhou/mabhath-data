شقص2
شقّصهُ, (L, TA,) inf. n. تَشْقِيصٌ, (L, Mgh,
K,) He divided it into parts, or portions:
(Mgh:) or he cut it up, and separated its members (A, L, K *) into just portions among the
sharers; (L, K; *) namely, a slaughtered animal,
(K,) or particularly a slaughtered sheep or goat,
and a pig: (L, A, TA:) or he divided it (namely,
a pig,) into parts or portions, and members, for
eating and selling. (Mgh.) Hence the trad. مَنْ
بَاعَ الخَمْرَ فَلْيُشَقِصِ الخَنَازِيرَ (L, A) He who sells
wine, let him cut up swine and divide their
members, as is done to a sheep or goat when its
flesh is sold: meaning, he who holds the selling
of wine to be lawful, let him hold the selling of
swine to be so; for they are equally forbidden.
(L, TA.)

and نَصِيبٌ, (A, Mgh, K,) and شِرْكٌ, (A, K,)
which signifies the same as نَصِيبٌ; (Sh, on the
authority of Khálid;) as also ↓ شَقِيصٌ; (Sh, M,
Mgh, K;) like نِصْفٌ and نَصِيفٌ: (M:) as, for
instance, in property; (IDrd;) and of a slave:
(TA:) or a certain share not divided: (EshSháfi'ee, TA:) or if divided it may also be thus
called: (Az, TA:) pl. [of pauc.] أَشْقَاصٌ (M, Msb)

having such a نصل, (Lth, IF, K,) with which
wild animals are shot; (Lth;) but Az says that
this explanation is at variance with what has been
heard from the Arabs: (TA:) or it signifies, (M,)
or signifies also, (K,) a long نصل; (M, K;) not
a broad one: (M:) or an arrow having such a
نصل; (M;) with which wild animals are shot:
(K:) or a long and broad نصل: (S:) or it is of
half the size of a نصل, and is worthless; children

[-head], and is used for shooting at objects of the
chase and any other thing: (TA:) pl. مَشَاقِصُ. (S.)
مُشَقِصٌ A butcher. (A, K.)
