شفع1
شَفَعَهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.
شَفَعَ, (Msb, K,)
inf. n. شَفْعٌ, (S, Msb,) He made it to be a شَفْع;
(S, K, TA;) meaning (TA) he made it (a single
thing) to be a زَوْج [i. e. he made it to be one of a
pair or couple; and sometimes, he made it to be a
pair or couple together]: (Mgh, TA:) or he
adjoined it to, or coupled it with, that which
was a single thing: (Msb:) accord. to Er-Rághib,
الشَّفْعُ signifies the adjoining a thing to its like.
(TA.) You say, كَانَ وِتْرًا فَشَفَعْتُهُ, (S,) or كَانَ
وِتْرًا فَشَفَعْتُهُ بِآخَرَ i. e. [It was a single thing, and]
I made it to be one of a pair, or couple, with
another. (Mgh. [In Har p. 194, I find the
phrase بآخر ↓ كان وترا فشفّعه, expl. in like
manner; but شفّعه thus used I do not find in any
lexicon: it may, however, be correctly thus used;
for تشفّع, which has the form, app. has also
the signification, of its quasi-pass.]) [And شُفِعَ
المِلْكُ بِمِلْكٍ آخَرَ The possession (here meaning
house, or piece of land,) was coupled by purchase
with another possession: and شُفِعَ بِهِ مِلْكٌ It
had a possession coupled with it by purchase: see
شُفْعَةٌ.] You say also, شَفَعْتُ الرَّكْعَةَ I made the
ركعة to be two. (Msb.) And a poet says,
مَا كَانَ أَبْصَرَنِى بِغِرَّاتِ الصِّبَى
فَالْيَوْمَ قَدْ شُفِعَتْ لِىَ الْأَشْبَاحُ
[How clear was my sight with the inadvertencies
of youth! but to-day, objects have become doubled
to me]: i. e., I see the object [as] two objects, by
reason of the weakness and dispersedness of my
sight. (O, K. *) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] one says of a she-camel, (S, O,) and of a ewe, or she-goat, (O,)
شَفَعَتْ, (S, O,) inf. n. شَفْعٌ, (S,) meaning She
became such as is termed شَافِعٌ [q. v.]: (S, O:)
she is thus termed لِأَنَّ وَلَدَهَا شَفَعَهَا أَوْ شَفَعَتْهُ
[because her young one has made her to be one of
a pair, or couple, with itself, or because she has
made it to be one of a pair or couple, with
another that is in her belly], (S, O, K,) inf. n.
شَفْعٌ, or the inf. n. in this case is شِفْعٌ, with kesr.
(O, K.) ―
-b3-  One says also, إِنَّهُ لَيَشْفَعُ عَلَىَّ بِالعَدَاوَةِ,
(K,) or لِى, (O,) i. e. (tropical:)  Verily he aids [another,
becoming to him one of a pair, by enmity] against
me, and acts injuriously to me [conjointly with
another]. (O, K, TA.) Accord. to Er-Rághib,
يَشْفَعُ means He joins himself to another, and
aids him, becoming to him one of a pair, or a
شَفِيع [i. e. an intercessor], in doing good or evil,
so that he aids him, or partakes with him, in
[procuring] the benefit or the harm thereof; and
thus it means in the saying in the Kur [iv. 87],
مَنْ يَشْفَعْ شَفَاعَةً حَسَنَةً [and in what follows the
same]: (TA:) or these words mean Whoso adds
a [good] deed to a [good] deed: (O, K:) or, as
some say, the شفاعة here is a man's instituting,
or prescribing, to another, a way of good or evil,
so that he [the latter] imitates him, and thus
becomes as though he were to him one of a pair.
(TA.) [But accord. to the expositors in general,
and accord. to the general usage of the inf. n.
شَفَاعَةٌ as distinguished from شَفْعٌ, what is here
meant is Intercession.] ―
-b4-  [Hence also,] شَفَعَ لَهُ
إِلَى فُلَانٍ, (S, * K, * TA,) or الى الأَمِيرِ, (MA,)
aor.
شَفَعَ, (K, TA,) inf. n. شَفَاعَةٌ; (MA, K, TA;)
and لَهُ ↓ تشفّع, (MA,) or فِيهِ ↓ تشفّع; (S, TA;)
He made petition, or intercession, for him [to
such a one, or to the prince or the like; thus
adjoining himself to him as an aider]: (MA,
TA:) and شَفَعَ بَيْنَ النَّاسِ [He interceded between
the people], inf. n. شَفَاعَةٌ: (Jel in iv. 87:) and
شَفَعْتُ فِى الأَمْرِ, (Msb,) inf. n. شَفَاعَةٌ (IKtt, Msb,
TA) and شَفْعٌ, (Msb, [but the latter is scarcely to
be found elsewhere thus used,]) I pleaded, [or
interceded,] in the affair, or case, [in favour of
another,] for some means of access or ingratiation,
or some right or due: (IKtt, * Msb, TA: *) شَفَاعَةٌ
is mentioned, but not explained, in the K: (TA:)
as distinguished from شَفْعٌ meaning as expl.
above, it signifies the joining oneself to another
as an aider to him or a petitioner respecting him
[or for him]; and in most instances the former
person is one of higher station than the latter:
(Er-Rághib, TA:) or the speaking of the شَفِيع
[or intercessor] to the king [or some other person]
respecting some object of want which the speaker
asks for another person: it is also expl. as signifying the passing over without punishment, or the
forgiving, [or rather the asking, or requesting,
the passing over &c., (for the word طَلَبُ, probably accidentally omitted by the transcriber at
the commencement of the explanation, should
doubtless be supplied,)] of sins, crimes, or misdeeds. (TA.) Hence, in a trad., ↓ اِشْفَعْ تُشَفَّعْ
[Intercede thou: thou shalt have thine intercession accepted]. (TA.) The saying in the Kur [ii.
117], وَلَا تَنْفَعُهَا شَفَاعَةٌ [Nor shall intercession
profit it] means that it shall have no شَافِع [or
intercessor] for his شَفَاعَة [or intercession] to
profit it; being a denial of the شَافِع; (Ibn-
'Arafeh, O, K;) and the same is the case in the
Kur lxxiv. 49, (Ibn-'Arafeh, O, TA,) and xx.
108. (TA.) شَفَعَ, inf. n. شَفْعٌ and شَفَاعَةٌ, also
signifies He prayed, or supplicated: and thus
Mbr and Th explain the words of the Kur [ii.
256], مَنْ ذَا الَّذِى يَشْفَعُ عِنْدَهُ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ [Who is he
that shall pray, or supplicate, in his presence,
except by his permission?]. (TA.) ―
-b5-  Accord. to
El-Kutabee, (Mgh,) [i. e.] El-Kuteybee, (TA,) one
says also, of a neighbour of one who desires to
sell a dwelling [or land] شَفَعَ إِلَيْهِ فِى مَا بَاعَ, meaning He made a demand to him, i. e. to the latter,
respecting that which he sold [for the right of
pre-emption]: and of the latter person, ↓ فَشَفَّعَهُ
[and he admitted his right of pre-emption, i. e.]
and he pronounced him to have a better right, or
title, or claim, [as a purchaser,] to that which
was sold, that he whose connexion was more
remote. (Mgh, TA. *)
-A2-  شَفَعَ, inf. n. شَفْعٌ, signifies also He, or it, was, or became, tall, or high.
(TA.)
-A3-  And شُفِعَ, like عُنِىَ, He (a man) was
smitten by the [evil] eye. (IKtt, TA. [But see
شُفْعَةٌ, last sentence.])
2
شَفَّعَ see 1, near the beginning. ―
-b2-  شَفَّعْتُهُ فِيهِ,
inf. n. تَشْفِيعٌ, I accepted his intercession (شَفَاعَتَهُ)
[for him]. (S, * O, K.) See, again, 1, in the last
quarter of the paragraph. ―
-b3-  And see another signification of the verb in a later part of the same
paragraph.
5
تشفّع [signifies It was made a pair or
couple, accord. to the K voce وِتْرٌ; this word
being there expl. as meaning مَا لَمْ يَتَشَفَّعْ مِنَ العَدَدِ:
but in the M and A, in the same place, instead of
يَتَشَفَّعْ, we find يُشْفَعْ]. ―
-b2-  تشفّع لَهُ, and فِيهِ: see 1,
near the middle of the paragraph. ―
-b3-  [It is said
in the TA that تَشَفَّعَهُ also is quasi-pass. of
اِسْتَشْفَعَ بِهِ: but تَشَفَّعَهُ is evidently, here, a mistranscription, app. for تَشَفَّعَ, meaning He was
granted intercession.]
-A2-  Also He became a
شَافِعِىّ [i. e. a follower of the Imám Esh-Sháfi'ee]
in persuasion: but this is post-classical. (TA.)
10
اِسْتَشْفَعْتُهُ إِلَى فُلَانٍ I asked him to make
intercession for me (أَنْ يَشْفَعَ لِى) to such a one.
(S, O, K. *) And اِسْتَشْفَعْتُ بِهِ I sought, or demanded, intercession (الشَّفَاعَةَ) [by means of him].
(Msb.) A poet, cited by Aboo-Leylà, says,
زَعَمَتْ مَعَاشِرُ أَنَّنِى مُسْتَشْفِعٌ
لَمَّا خَرَجْتُ أَزُورُهُ أَقْلَامَهَا
i. e. Companies of men asserted me to be seeking
intercession (زَعَمُوا أَنِى أَسْتَشْفِعُ) for the object of
eulogy, [when I went forth repairing to visit
him,] by means of their writing-reeds (بِأَقْلَامِهِمْ),
meaning by their letters (بِكُتُبِهِمْ). (O, TA.)
شَفْعٌ contr. of وِتْرٌ; (S, Mgh, O, K;) i. q. زَوْجٌ
[i. e., like زَوْجٌ, it signifies One of a pair or
couple; and sometimes, but rarely, a pair or
couple together; and sometimes, (see for instance
زَكَا) an even number, a number that may be
divided into two equal numbers]: (O, K:) also
one with which another is made to be a pair or
couple: (TA:) [and, as will be seen in what
follows, one with which an odd number is made
to be an even number:] pl. شِفَاعٌ, (TA,) and app.
أَشْفَاعٌ, whence الصَّلَاةُ بَيْنَ الأَشْفَاعِ, meaning
التَّرَاوِيح [q. v. voce تَرْوِيحَةٌ]. (Mgh.) ―
-b2-  الشَّفْعُ
also signifies The day of the sacrifice; (O, K;)
thus in the words of the Kur [lxxxix. 2] وَالشَّفْعِ
وَالْوِتْرِ; by الوتر being meant the day of 'Arafát:
(O:) or in this instance it means the creatures of
God, (O, K,) because of the saying in the Kur
[li. 49], “and of everything we have created two
of a pair; ” (K;) الوتر meaning God: (O, K:) or
Adam's wife; الوتر meaning Adam, who was
made a pair with her: (I'Ab, O, TA:) or Adam's
children: (TA:) or the two days after the sacrifice; الوتر meaning the third day: (O, TA:) or
God; [and الوتر, those who compose an odd
number;] because of the saying in the Kur [lviii.
8], “there can be no secret discourse of three,
but He is the maker of them, with Himself, to
be four: ” (K:) or the meaning of الشَّفْعُ وَالوِتْرُ is
the prayers; of which some are شَفْع [i. e. an even
number of rek'ahs], and some are وِتْر [i. e. an odd
number of rek'ahs]: (O, TA:) [for] it is said that
all the numbers consist of شَفْع [i. e. even] and وِتْر
[i. e. odd]. (TA.)
شَفْعَةٌ: see the next paragraph, in two places,
near the end.
شُفْعَةٌ is used in relation to a house and to land;
(S, TA;) and ↓ شُفُعَةٌ, with two dammehs, is a
dial. var. thereof thus used. (TA.) It signifies
A مِلْك [here meaning house, or piece of land,]
that is coupled (مَشْفُوع) [by purchase] with one's
مِلْك [i. e. house, or piece of land, previously
possessed, and adjoining thereto]; (Mgh, Msb; *)
from the phrase كَانَ وِتْرًا فَشَفَعْتُهُ [expl. above, in
the second sentence of this art.]; (Mgh; [and the
like is said in the Msb;]) a noun of the same
class as لُقْمَةٌ; being of the measure فُعْلَةٌ in the
sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ: (Mgh, Msb: *) this
is the primary signification: then it was applied
to denote a particular kind of obtaining possession; (Mgh;) [i. e.] it is also used as meaning the
obtaining possession of that مِلْك [or house, or
piece of land, by purchasing it, and coupling it
with that previously possessed, and adjoining
thereto]; (Msb;) or one's making a demand
respecting that which he seeks [to possess, for the
right of the pre-emption thereof], and adjoining
it to that which he [already] has: (O, K:) and
with the lawyers it signifies the right of obtaining
possession of a piece of land, [i. e. the right of
pre-emption thereof, or of a house,] against one's
co-sharer whose possession is recent, by compulsion, for a compensation: (K:) or the right of
obtaining possession of a piece of land, by compulsion, for [the payment of] what it cost the
[former] purchaser, by reason of partnership or
of [immediate] neighbourship: (KT:) or the
right of [immediate] neighbourship with respect
to [pre-emption of] a house or land. (PS.) [See
1 in art. سقب.] El-Kutabee says, in explaining
this word, in the Time of Ignorance, when a man
desired to sell a house, his neighbour used to
come to him and to make a demand to him (شَفَعَ
إِلَيْهِ i. e. طَلَبَ) respecting that which he sold [for
the right of pre-emption], and he pronounced
him to have a better right, or title, or claim, [as a
purchaser,] to that which was sold, than he whose
connexion was more remote: as though he took
it from الشَّفَاعَةُ: but the [right] derivation is that
first mentioned. (Mgh.) We have not heard,
(Mgh,) or there is not known, (Msb,) any verb
belonging to it [in the classical language]. (Mgh,
Msb.) Esh-Shaabee uses it in the first and in the
second of the senses expl. above, [or nearly so,]
in his saying, مَنْ بِيعَتْ شُفْعَتُهُ وَهُوَ حَاضِرٌ فَلَمْ
يَطْلُبْ ذٰلِكَ فَلَا شُفْعَةَ لَهُ [i. e. He whose claimed
possession to be coupled by purchase with one
already belonging to him is sold when he is present
without his demanding that possession, there shall
be no obtaining possession for him by his purchasing it for that purpose]. (Mgh. [And the
like is said in the Msb.]) Esh-Shaabee says
[also], الشُّفْعَةُ عَلَى رُؤُوسِ الرِجَالِ [The possession
that is coupled by purchase with another possession is apportioned according to the heads of the
men entitled thereto]: i. e., when the house is
shared by a company of men whose shares are
different, and one of them sells his portion, what
is sold to his co-sharers is to be apportioned among
them equally, according to their heads, not according to their [former] shares: (O, K, TA:)
so in the Nh. (TA.) ―
-b2-  شُفْعَةُ الضُّحَى The two
rek'ahs (رَكْعَتَانِ) of the [prayer that is performed in the period of the morning called the]
ضُحَى; as also الضحى ↓ شَفْعَةُ: (O, K:) occurring
in a trad., thus accord. to two different relations.
(O.)
-A2-  Also Diabolical, or demoniacal, possession; or madness, or insanity; (AA, O, K;) and
so ↓ شَفْعَةٌ; the latter expl. in this sense by IAar;
and as syn. with سَفْعَةٌ and شُنْعَةٌ and رَدَّةٌ and نَظْرَةٌ,
[perceived] in the face: [see these words; the
second and third of which generally mean an
unseemliness or ugliness; and so, sometimes, does
the last:] the pl. of شُفْعَةٌ in the sense here expl.
on the authority of AA is شُفَعٌ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And
IF states that it has been said to signify The
[evil] eye, by which one is smitten: but he doubts
its correctness; and thinks that it may be with
the unpointed س. (O.) [See سَفْعَةٌ, not سُفْعَةٌ.]
شُفُعَةٌ: see شُفْعَةٌ, first sentence.
شَفُوعٌ A she-camel that fills two milking-vessels
in one milking. (S, K.) ―
-b2-  See also شَافِعٌ.
شَفِيعٌ i. q. صَاحِبُ شَفَاعَةٍ; (S, K, TA;) i. e.
(TA) An intercessor; as also ↓ شَافِعٌ: pl. of the
former شُفَعَآءُ. (Msb, TA.) [See السُّقَفَآء, in art.
سقف.] ―
-b2-  Also i. q. صَاحِبُ شُفْعَةٍ; (S, K;) [meaning A possessor of the right termed شُفْعَة; or]
one who demands, and is granted, as a neighbour
[or a partner], in preference to him whose connexion is more remote, the right of purchasing
a house [or piece of land] that is to be sold.
(TA.)
شَفَائِعُ Sorts of pasture, or herbage, that grow
two and two: (Ibn-Abbád, O, K:) or twins
(تُؤَام [pl. of تَوْءَم]) of plants. (O, K.)
شَافِعٌ [act. part. n. of 1, q. v. ―
-b2-  Hence], applied
to a she-camel, (tropical:)  Having a young one in her
belly and another following her: (Fr, Sh, S, Mgh,
K, TA:) or applied in this sense to a ewe or she-goat: (K:) or, thus applied, having her young one
with her: (A'Obeyd, S, Mgh:) thus called because
her young one has made her to be one of a pair
[with it], or because she has made it to be one of
a pair [with her]: (A'Obeyd, S, K:) and ↓ شَفُوعٌ,
thus applied, signifies the same as شَافِعٌ: and one
says also, هٰذِهِ شَاةُ الشَّافِعِ, like as one says صَلَاةُ
الأُولَى and مَسْجِدُ الجَامِعِ. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Also A
he-goat, (O, K, TA,) himself: (O:) or a ram:
or such as, when he impregnates, impregnates
with twins. (O, K.) ―
-b4-  عَيْنٌ شَافِعَةٌ An eye [that
makes a thing to appear a pair, i. e.,] that sees
doubly. (O, K.) ―
-b5-  فُلَانٌ يُعَادِينِى وَلَهُ شَافِعٌ means
(tropical:)  Such a one treats me with enmity, and has one
who aids him to do so. (A, TA.) ―
-b6-  See also
شَفِيعٌ and مُشَفَّعٌ.
أَشْفَعُ Tall, or high. (L, TA.)
مُشْفِعٌ A ewe, or she-goat, that suckles any
animal. (IAar, TA.)
مُشَفَّعٌ One whose intercession is accepted:
hence the Kur-án is termed by Ibn-Mes'ood
مُشَفَّعٌ ↓ شَافِعٌ, i. e. An intercessor of which the
intercession will be accepted, for him who follows
it and does according to what is in it, that his
unpremeditated transgressions may be forgiven.
(O, TA.)
مُشَفِعٌ One who accepts intercession. (L, TA.)
مَشْفُوعٌ A possession (مِلْكٌ [here meaning house,
or piece of land,]) coupled [by purchase] with a
man's possession [previously belonging to him,
upon certain conditions expl. voce شُفْعَةٌ]. (Mgh,
Msb.)
-A2-  Also Affected with diabolical, or demoniacal, possession; or with madness, or insanity;
(O, K;) and مَسْفُوعٌ, with the unpointed س, is a
dial. var. thereof. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And مَشْفُوعَةٌ is said
to signify A woman smitten by the [evil] eye:
(IF, O, L: [but see شُفْعَةٌ, last sentence:]) the
masc. is not used in this sense. (L, TA.)
