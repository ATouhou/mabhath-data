Q. 2
تَبَهْرَجَ It (a place) became, or was
made, free to the people in general to pasture
their beasts in it. (IAar, L.)
بَهْرَجٌ an arabicized word, (T, S, Mgh, L, TA,)
from نَبَهْرَهْ, (T, Mgh, L, TA,) which is Persian;
(L, TA;) or, as some say, it is an Indian word,
originally نَبَهْلَهْ, meaning Bad, whence the Persian
نَبَهْرَهْ, and hence the arabicized بَهْرَجٌ; (TA;) applied to a dirhem, as meaning bad; (Kr, S;)
false; (S, El-Marzookee;) adulterated; (Shifá
el-Ghaleel, El-Marzookee;) of bad silver; (A,
Mgh, L, Msb;) with which one cannot buy:
(IAar, TA:) or, as some say, in which the silver
is predominant: or, accord. to IAar, of which
the die has been falsified: (Mgh:) or not coined
in the government-mint: (Lb, TA:) and ↓ مُبْهَرَجٌ
signifies the same, applied to a dirhem; (Lh, A,
Mgh;) and so ↓ نَبَهْرَجٌ; (Lh, El-Marzookee;)
but [Mtr says,] I have not found it with ن, except on the authority of Lh (Mgh;) and IKh
says that it is a word of the vulgar: (TA:) the
pl. [of بهرج] is بَهَارِجُ, and [of نبهرج,] نَبَهْرَجَاتُ.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  Hence, metaphorically, (Mgh,) (tropical:)  Bad;
(S, A, Mgh, L, Msb, K;) and false, or of no
account; (S, A, Mgh, K;) applied to a thing (S,
A, Mgh, L, Msb) of any kind: (A, Mgh, L:) anything rejected; not received or accepted; rejected
as wrong or bad; as also ↓ نَبَهْرَجٌ: (TA:) and a
thing is termed ↓ مُبَهْرَجٌ when it is as though it were
cast away, and not an object of emulous desire or
envy, or not in request. (El-Marzookee, TA.)
You say, كَلَامٌ بَهْرَجٌ (tropical:)  Bad language. (A, L.)
And عَمَلٌ بَهْرَجٌ (tropical:)  A bad action. (A, L.) ―
-b3-
(assumed tropical:)  Allowed or allowable [to any person, to be taken
or let alone, or to be possessed or made use of or
done]; made allowable, free, or lawful. (K.) You
say, دَمٌ بَهْرَجٌ (tropical:)  Blood made to be of no account,
to go for nothing, unretaliated, or uncompensated
by a mulct; allowed to be taken or shed; (A, L;)
as also ↓ مُبَهْرَجٌ. (K.) And مَكَانٌ بَهْرَجٌ (assumed tropical:)  A place
free to the people in general to pasture their beasts
in it. (IAar, L.) And ↓ مَآءٌ مُبَهْرَجٌ (assumed tropical:)  A water
