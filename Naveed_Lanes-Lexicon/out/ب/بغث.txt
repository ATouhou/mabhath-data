بغث1
بَغِثَ, (Msb, K,) aor.
بَغَثَ, (K,) inf. n. بُغْثَةٌ,
(Msb,) or this is a simple subst., and the inf. n. is
بَغَثٌ, (TA,) He (a bird) was, or became, of a
colour resembling that of ashes: (Msb:) or he (a
sheep or goat) was of the mixed colours of those
to which the epithet بَغْثَآءُ is applied. (K, TA.)
[See أَبْغَثُ, and بُغْثَةٌ, and بَغَثٌ.]
بَغَثٌ Dust-colour. (A.) [But see بُغْثَةٌ. Accord.
to the TA, the former is the inf. n. of 1, q. v.]
بُغْثَةٌ Whiteness inclining to خُضْرَة [which here
app. means a dark, or ashy, dust-colour]: (T:)
[or, in a bird, a colour resembling that of ashes:
(see 1:)] or the colour of sheep or goats to which
the epithet بَغْثَآءُ is applied. (K, TA.) [See أَبْغَثُ.]
بَغْثَآءُ: see أَبْغَثُ, of which it is the fem.
بَغَاثٌ (T, S, A, Mgh, Msb, K) and بُغَاثٌ and
بِغَاثٌ; (A, Mgh, K;) only the second of these
three mentioned by Sb; (TA;) but the second
and third asserted to be correct by Yoo; (AZ,
TA;) and the last heard by Az; (TA;) or
neither of these two is allowable; (Msb;) A bird
that does not prey, and such as one does not desire
to make an object of prey because it is not eaten:
(T, Msb:) or small birds that do not prey, such
as sparrows and the like; [a coll. gen. n.;] n. un.
with ة: (Mgh:) or [accord. to Lth,] a certain
dust-coloured bird, (T, A, K,) of the birds of the
water, ash-coloured, and long-necked; as also
↓ أَبْغَثُ; pl. [of the latter] بُغْثٌ and أَبَاغِثُ: (T:)
[but this appears to be wrong; for AM says, in
the T,] Lth makes the بغاث and the ابغث to be
one, asserting them to be of aquatic birds; but in
my opinion, the former is different from the latter:
as to the latter, it is a well-known kind of aquatic
bird, so called because it is of the colour termed
بُغْثَة, i. e. white inclining to خُضْرَة [explained
above, voce بُغْثَةٌ]: but as to the بغاث, it is any
bird that is not one of prey: and the word is said
to be a coll. gen. n., signifying the class of birds
that are objects of prey: (TA:) ISk says that
the بَغَاث is a bird of a colour inclining to that of
dust, (S, Msb, *) a little less than the رَخَمَة [or
vultur percnopterus], (S,) or less than the رخمة,
(Msb,) slow in flight: (S, Msb:) but IB says
that this is a mistake in two points of view; first,
because بغاث is a [coll.] gen. n., of which the
n. un. is with ة, like as is that of حَمَامٌ; and
secondly, because it applies to the class of birds
that do not prey; but the ↓ أَبْغَث is a bird of the
colour of dust, and this may be a bird of prey,
and it may be not a bird of prey: (TA:) AZ
says that بغاث signifies the [species of vulture
called] رَخَم; and the n. un. is with ة others, the
young ones of the رخم and birds of the crowkind: or [birds] like the [hawks called] سَوَادِق
[pl. of سَوْدَقٌ], not predaceous: in the T, it is said
to be [a kind of bird] like the [hawk called] بَاشَق,
that does not prey upon any other bird: (TA:)
or بِغَاثٌ and بُغَاثٌ (ISd, K) and بَغَاثٌ (K) signify
the worst [or most ignoble] of birds, (ISd, K,
[the latter giving this as a second and distinct
signification,]) and such as do not prey: (ISd,
TA:) Fr says, بَغَاثُ الطَّيْرِ signifies the worst of
birds, and such as do not prey; and بُغَاثٌ and
بِغَاثٌ are dial. vars.: (S:) the pl. is بِغْثَانٌ, (Sb,
T, S, Msb, K,) accord. to those who make بغاث a
sing., (Yoo, S, Msb, TA,) or accord. to those who
make the sing. to be with ة; (T, TA;) or those
who apply بَغَاثَةٌ [as a n. un.] to the male and the female make بَغَاثٌ to be pl. [or rather a coll. gen. n.];
(Yoo, S, Msb;) as is done in the case of نَعَامَةٌ and
نَعَامٌ: (Yoo, S:) ISd says that بَغَاثَةٌ, with fet-h,
is the n. un., applied alike to the male and the
female: (TA:) [and Fei says,] it is not allowable
to pronounce this with damm or with kesr to the
first letter: (Msb:) but Yoo asserts both of these
forms to be used: (AZ, TA:) and بغاثة is said to
signify a weak bird. (TA.) It is said in a prov.,
إِنَّ البَغَاثَ بِأَرْضِنَا يَسْتَنْسِرُ (S, A, Msb, K *) Verily
the بغاث in our land becomes [like] a vulture, or
become [like] vultures: (Msb:) applied to the
low person who becomes of high rank: (A:)
meaning (tropical:)  the weak in our land becomes strong:
(Msb:) or he who makes himself our neighbour
becomes mighty, strong, or of high rank, by our
means, (S, K, TA,) acquiring the might, or strength,
of the vulture, after having been low, or mean, in
condition. (TA.)
بَغِيثٌ Wheat (حِنْطَةٌ and طَعَامٌ [both of which
signify the same, though the latter, q. v., has a
a larger application,]) adulterated by being mixed
with barley; (Th, K;) as also غَلِيثٌ and لَغِيثٌ.
(Th, TA.)
بُغَيْثَآءُ [dim. of بَغْثَآءُ fem. of أَبْغَثُ, q. v.,] The
place of the حَقِيبَة [q. v.] in a camel. (K.) [So
called because of its colour, produced by chafing.]
أَبْغَثُ Of a white colour inclining to خُضْرَة
[which here app. means a dark, or ashy, dustcolour]: (T:) [or of a colour resembling that of
ashes: (see 1:)] or dust-coloured: (A:) or of a
colour near to that of dust: (S:) an epithet, like
أَحْمَرُ: [fem. بَغْثَآءُ: and] pl. بُغْثٌ: and sometimes,
when used as a subst., it has for pl. أَبَاغِثُ. (IB,
TA.) You say طَائِرٌ أَبْغَثُ A bird of the colour
above described: (T, S:) whether it be a bird of
prey or not: see بَغَاثٌ in two places: (IB, TA:)
and صَقْرٌ أَبْغَثُ [a hawk of that colour.]; (ISh,
A;) as well as أَحْوَى and أَبْيَضُ; i. e., that wherewith men take game. (ISh, TA.) بَغْثَآءُ applied
to sheep or goats, (S, K,) or, as in some lexicons,
to sheep, (TA,) is like رَقْطَآءُ; (S, K;) [Black
speckled with white; or the reverse;] or in which
are blackness and whiteness, with predominance
of the latter colour: (TA:) or شَاةٌ بَغْثَآءُ and غَنَمٌ
بُغْثٌ signify a sheep or goat, and sheep or goats,
in which are blackness and whiteness. (A.) ―
-b2-  Also,
[as a subst.,] A certain bird, (K, TA,) dustcoloured, in truth different from the بَغَاث, as
shown above: see the latter word: (TA:) pl.
بُغْثٌ and أَبَاغِثُ. (T, TA.) You say, هُوَ مِنْ أَبَاغِثِ
الطَّيْرِ [He is of the birds thus called]. (A.) ―
-b3-
And الأَبْغَثُ signifies The lion; (TS, K;) because
he is of the colour termed بُغْثَةٌ. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And
البَغْثَآءُ (tropical:)  The medley, or mixed or promiscuous
multitude or collection, of men or people; or of
the lowest or basest or meanest sort, or refuse, or
riffraff, thereof; (S, A, K;) the commonalty, or
vulgar, and collective body, of the people. (S.)
One says, خَرَجَ فَلَانٌ فِى البَغْثَآءِ and الغَثْرَآءِ (tropical:)  Such
a one went forth among the medley, &c., of the
people. (A.) And دَخَلْنَا فِى البَغْثَآءِ (tropical:)  We entered
among the commonalty, or vulgar, and the collective body, of the people. (S.)
