بظر1
بَظِرَتْ, [aor.
بَظَرَ, inf. n. بَظَرٌ,] said of a woman,
[She had a بَظْر (q. v.), or a long بَظْر; or] she
was uncircumcised. (Msb.) [But see بَظَرٌ, below.]
―
-b2-  And بَظِر, inf. n. بَظَرٌ, He had what is termed
a بُظَارَة [q. v.] in his upper lip. (S.)
2
بَظَّرَتْ, inf. n. تَبْظِيرٌ, She circumcised a
female. (K.) ―
-b2-  هُوَ يُمِصُّهُ وَيُبَظِّرُهُ (M, K) He
says to him, اُمْصُصْ بَظْرَ فُلَانَةَ: (K:) a prov. of
the Arabs. (TA.)
بَظْرٌ, (Lh, T, S, M, &c.,) also pronounced بَضْرٌ,
(T,) and ↓ بُظَارَةٌ [which see below] (Lh, T, S,
M, K) and ↓ بَظَارَةٌ (M, K) and ↓ بَيْظَرٌ (Lh, T, M,
K) and ↓ بُنْظُرٌ, (K,) A certain thing, (S, M,
Mgh, K,) or piece of flesh, (A,) between the two
sides of the vulva (الإِسْكَتَانِ, S, M, K, or الشُّفْرَانِ,
A, or شُفْرَا الفَرْجِ, Mgh) of a woman, (M, A,
Mgh, K,) which is cut off in circumcision, (A,)
not yet cut off; (S;) a piece of flesh between the two
sides of the vulva (الشُّفْرَانِ) of a woman; i. e.
the prepuce (قُلْقَة) that is cut off in circumcision;
(Msb;) also called كَيْنٌ and رَفْرَفٌ and نَوْفٌ
(Lh, T) and قُنْبٌ [which last properly signifies
the “ prepuce,” or “ sheath,” of a beast or horse
or the like]; (A and K in art. قنب;) and likened
to a cock's comb: (Msb in art. عرف:) [the last
of these explanations plainly shows that what is
meant thereby is the prepuce of the clitoris;
which, it seems, in the Arabian and Egyptian
races, and others throughout Eastern Africa, and
still more so in the Hottentot race, grows to an
extraordinary size; and this may be the reason
why the بظر is described by some travellers as
a caruncle for which we have no name: or it may,
perhaps, be a distinct excrescence from the prepuce of the clitoris: it has been described to me
as a caruncle a little in front of the meatus
urinarius: many of the Egyptians assert that it
is the clitoris itself that is amputated, (as Ludolph
also does in his Comment. to his Ethiop. Hist.
p. 273, finding fault with those who say otherwise;) and they affirm that this is done for the
purpose of lessening the libidinous passion: such,
indeed, appears to be the case in some instances,
but not generally; and it may have led to a misapplication of the term بظر in post-classical times:
an analogous practice, one still more barbarous,
is said to have obtained among an African race
hence called the Colobi: see بَرْبَرُ: Abu-l-Kásim
Ez-Zahráwee speaks of the amputation of the redundance of the بظر when preternaturally large,
and also of an excrescence in the vulva: the
former he describes in such a manner as plainly
shows that he means thereby the clitoris: the
latter, in terms apparently indicating a preternatural elongation of the lower part of the prepuce of the clitoris; as “ an excrescence of flesh
at, or in, the mouth of the vulva, such as fills it
up, and sometimes protrudes externally, like a
tail, wherefore the ancients term it the caudal
disease المرض الذنبى; and this,” he says,
“ should be amputated, like as the بظر is amputated ” when preternaturally large: (Albucasis de
Chirurgia, pp. 314 and 316:) in some of our
medical books, the term “ caudatio ” is defined
as “ an elongation of the clitoris; ” inconsistently
with the foregoing description of “ the caudal
disease: ”] the pl. [of mult.] of بَظْرٌ is بُظُورٌ, (M,
Msb, K,) and [pl. of pauc.] أَبْظُرٌ. (Msb.) يَا ابْنَ
