بقى1
بَقِيَ aor. يَبْقَى, inf. n. بَقَآءٌ (JK, S, Msb, K)
and بَاقِيَةٌ; (Msb; [but see this latter below;])
[and accord. to the CK, بَقًى and بَقْىٌ; but this
is a mistake; وَبَقَى و بَقْيًا being there erroneously
put for بَقَى بَقْيًا, explained by what here follows;]
and بَقَى, [by some written بَقَا,] (JK, S, Msb, K,)
aor. as above, (JK,) inf. n. بَقْىٌ, (K,) of the dial.
of Belhárith Ibn-Kaab, (TA,) or of that of Teiyi,
(JK, S, TA,) who in like manner say بَقَتْ instead
of بَقَيَتْ, (S, TA,) and the like is done in other
verbs of the same class, (S, Msb,) whether the
kesreh and the ى be original, as in بَقِىَ and نَسِىَ
and فَنِىَ, or accidental, as in the pass. verbs هُدِىَ
and بُنِىَ; (Msb;) [He, or] it, namely, a thing,
remained, continued, lasted, endured: and was,
or became, permanent, or perpetual; or continued,
lasted, or existed, incessantly, always, endlessly,
or for ever: syn. دَامَ, and ثَبَتَ; (Msb;) contr.
of فَنِىَ: (K:) بَقَآءٌ signifies a thing's remaining,
continuing, lasting, or enduring, in its first state,
to a period determined by the will of God, either
with respect to its corporeal substance, as in the
case of a heavenly orb, or with respect to its kind
only, as in the case of the human and other
animal races; and the continuing, lasting, or
existing, for ever, either by self, as in the instance
of God alone, or otherwise, and thus either with
respect to the corporeal substance, as in the case
of an inhabitant of Paradise, or with respect to
kind only, as in the case of the fruits of the inhabitants of Paradise. (Er-Rághib, TA.) [Hence,]
دَارُ البَقَآءِ [The abode of everlasting existence;] the
world to come. (T in art. دور.) The verb is said
of a thing; and in like manner of a man, as in
بَقِىَ زَمَانًا طَوِيلًا, i. e. He lived [or continued in
life] a long time. (S.) [You say also, بَقِىَ عَلَى
حَالِهِ He, or it, remained, or continued, in his,
or its, state, or condition; i. e., as he, or it, was.
And بَقِىَ عَلَى الشِّدَّةِ He endured, or bore up
against, difficulty, distress, or adversity.] And
بَقِى مِنَ الشَّىْءِ بَقِيَّةٌ [A remain, remainder, remnant, relic, or residue, of the thing remained.]
(S.) And بَقِىَ مِنْهُ كَذَا Such a thing remained,
over and above, and behind, thereof; as also
↓ تبقّى. (Msb.)
-A2-  بَقَاهُ, with ى and with و for
the last radical, (K,) first pers. بَقَيْتُهُ (Lh, S) and
بَقَوْتُهُ, (Lh, TA,) aor. of the former
بَقِىَ, (S,) inf. n.
بَقْىٌ, [of the former verb,] (K,) He looked at
him, or it: (Lh, S, K:) or [so in the K, but in
the S “ and,”] he watched, or observed, him, or
it: (S, K:) and بَقَيْتُهُ I looked, watched, or
waited, for him, or it; (TA in art. بقو;) as also
بَقَوْتُهُ; (K in that art.;) but the former is the
more approved. (TA in that art.) [See also art.
بقو.] You say also, فُلَانٌ يَبْقِى الشَّىْءَ بِبَصَرِهِ Such
a one looks at the thing, and watches, or observes,
it. (JK.) And it is said in a trad., بَقَيْنَا رَسُولَ اللّٰهِ
We looked, watched, or waited, for the Apostle
of God. (S.)

بَقَّىَ see 4, in two places.

ابقاهُ (S, Msb, K) and ↓ بقّاهُ and ↓ تبقّاهُ (S,
K) all signify the same, (S,) and ↓ استبقاهُ likewise, (K,) He made, or caused, [and he suffered,]
him, or it, to remain, continue, last; to be, or
become, permanent, or perpetual; to continue,
last, or exist, incessantly, always, endlessly, or
for ever; he continued it; he perpetuated it.
(Msb, K *) You say, ابقاهُ اللّٰهُ [God preserved
him, or prolonged his life; or may God preserve
him, or prolong his life; or] God made him, or
caused him, or may God make him, or cause him,
to continue in life. (S.) And أَبْقَى أَصْلَ الشَّىْءِ
وَجَعَلَ ثَمَرَهُ فِى سَبِيلِ اللّٰهِ He made the thing itself
to remain unalienable, not to be inherited nor
sold nor given away, and assigned the profit
arising from it to be employed in the cause of
God, or of religion. (TA in art. حبس.) And
أَبْقَيْتُ مَا بَيْنَنَا I was sparing of marring, i. e.,
forbore from marring much, or exceedingly, that
[state of union or amity] which subsisted between
us. (K.) And نَعْلَيْكَ وَابْذُلْ قَدَمَيْكَ ↓ بَقِّ [Pre-
serve thou, or spare thou, thy sandals, and use
freely, or unsparingly, thy feet]: a prov. (Meyd.
See Freytag's Arab. Prov. i. 149.) And ↓ تَبَقَّهْ
وَتَوَقَّهْ Preserve thou the soul (النَّفْسَ ↓ اِسْتَبْقِ),
expose it not to destruction, [meaning preserve
thyself,] and guard against evils, or calamities:
a trad.: the ه in each verb is that of pausation.
(TA.) [And ابقى مِنَ الشَّىْءِ بَقِيَّةً He left, or
reserved, of the thing, a remain, remainder, remnant, &c.:] and مِنَ الشَّىْءِ ↓ استبقى He left a
portion of the thing; (S, K;) as also ↓ تبقّى;
whence the prov., used to incite to liberality,
↓ لَا يَنْفَعُكَ مِنْ زَادٍ تَبَقٍّ Leaving a portion of travel-ling-provision will not profit thee. (JK.) [And
ابقى الشَّىْءِ and ↓ استبقاهُ He reserved the thing
for a future time or use &c.] And ↓ استبقاهُ as
meaning [He spared him; he let him live;] he
left him alive; (S, K;) [as also ابقاهُ; for] men
say to their enemies when the latter have overcome, أَبْقُونَا وَ لَا تَسْتَأْصِلُونَا [Spare ye us, and
destroy us not entirely]: (TA:) [or ابقاهُ, in a
case of this kind,] and ابقى عَلَيْهِ and ↓ استبقاهُ
signify He pardoned him, [and forbore to slay
him,] when slaughter was his due: (TA:) and
↓ استبقاهُ signifies also He pardoned, or forgave,
his fault, wrong action, or lapse into sin, and
preserved his love, or affection. (JK, TA. *) And
[hence,] أَبْقَيْتُ عَلَى فُلَانٍ signifies also I showed
mercy to such a one [by sparing him, or letting
him live, or by pardoning him, or otherwise];
had mercy on him; pitied, or compassionated,
him; syn. أَرْعَيْتُ عَلَيْهِ and رَحِمْتُهُ. (S.) One says,
لَا أَبْقَى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْكَ إِنْ أَبْقَيْتَ عَلَىَّ [May God not
show mercy to thee if thou show mercy to
me: a prov., said in derision to one who affects
to show mercy when unable to take revenge].
(S, Meyd.) And لَا تُبْقِ إِلَّا عَلَى نَفْسِكَ [Show not
mercy save to thyself: another prov., similar to
the former]. (Meyd.) And it is said, in a trad.,
of the fire [of Hell], لَا تُبْقِى عَلَى مَنْ تَضَرَّعَ إِلَيْهَا,
i. e. It will not pity [him who abases himself to
it: or rather it will not spare &c.: and in like
manner, لَا تُبْقِى وَلَا تَذَرُ, in the Kur lxxiv. 28, is
generally understood as meaning It (namely,
Hell,) will not spare, nor leave unburned]. (TA.)

إِسْتَبْقَىَ see 4, in seven places. [See also a usage
of this verb in art. حى, conj. 10, second sentence.]
لَقٍى بَقًى: see بَقَاقٌ.
بَقْيَةٌ: see بَقِيَّةٌ.
بَقْوَى: see بُقْيَا, in five places.
بُقوَى: see بُقْيَا, in two places.
بَقْيَا: see what next follows.
بُقْيَا (JK, S, Msb, K, &c.) and ↓ بَقْيَا (TA) and
↓ بَقْوَى (JK, S, Msb, K) and ↓ بُقْوَى (Th, K) and
↓ (JK, K,) the ↓ third and ↓ fourth with ى
changed into و, like as و is changed into ى in
دُنْيَا and عُلْيَا and قُصْيَا, (ISd, TA,) [substs. in the
sense of إِبْقَآءٌ, inf. n. of 4, signifying The making,
or causing, and suffering, to remain, continue,
last, &c.; preservation of a person in life, and of
a thing in being; and the sparing, letting live, or
leaving alive;] substs. from أَبْقَاهُ: (Msb, K:) or
[the showing mercy by sparing or letting live, or
by pardoning, or otherwise; having mercy; pitying, or compassionating;] substs. from أَبْقَيْتُ عَلَى
فُلَانٍ. (S.) Thus one says of a pilgrim, that he
put gum, or something glutinous, upon his head,
and so caused his hair to become compacted,
بُقْيَا عَلَيْهِ to preserve it in the state in which it was
(expl. by إِبْقَآءً عليه), lest it should become shaggy,
or dishevelled, &c. (L in art. لبد.) And one says,
نَشَدْتُكَ اللّٰهَ وَالبُقْيَا and ↓ البَقْوَى [I conjure, or beg,
or beseech, thee by God and by the preservation
of thy life]. (JK.) And مَا لِى عَلَيْه رَعْوَى وَلَا
↓ بَقْوَى [I have no mercy nor pity to bestow upon
him]. (JK. [There expl. by the words أَىْ أَرْعَيْتُ
عَلَيْهِ وَأَبْقَيْتُ; but أَىْ is evidently a mistranscription for مِنْ, i. e. from.]) A poet (El-La'een ElMinkaree, TA) says,
فَمَا بُقْيَا عَلَىَّ تَرَكْتُمَانِى
وَلٰكِنْ خِفْتُمَا صَرَدَ النِّبَالِ
[And it was not to show mercy by sparing me
that ye two left me; but ye feared the transpiercing of the arrows]. (S.) And another says,
on his having refused to accept an offer of seven
bloodwits,
أُذَكَّرُ بِالبُقْيَا عَلَى مَنْ أَصَابَنِى
وَبُقْيَاىَ أَنِّى جَاهِدٌ غَيْرُ مُؤْتَلِى
i. e. Am I required [or exhorted or reminded] to
show mercy to him who slew my relation, when
the mercy that I show to him is that I am
labouring to slay him, and not falling short, or
being remiss: by بقياى is meant إِبْقَائِى عَلَيْهِ;
though الإِبْقَآء is not الجَهْد: the meaning is, that
this is done by me in lieu of that: البُقْيَا is a subst.
from الإِبْقَآء, syn. therewith; and the و prefixed
to it is a denotative of state. (Ham p. 119. [This
verse is also cited in the TA, but with the substitution of ↓ بِالبَقْوَى and وَبَقْوَاى for the corresponding words above.] ↓ البَقِيَّةَ is said by men to their
enemies when the latter have overcome; meaning
[We ask, or beg, the being spared, or mercy, or
quarter; a verb, whereby it is governed, being
understood: or] أَبْقُونَا وَلَا تَسْتَأْصِلُونَا [spare ye us,
and destroy us not entirely]. (TA.)
بَقِيَّةٌ A remain, remainder, remaining portion,
remnant, relic, residue, or the remains, or rest,
of a thing; (KL, PS, &c.;) a subst. from
بَقِىَ as signifying “ it remained over and above,”
and “ it remained behind: ” pl. بَقَايَا and بَقِيَّاتٌ:
(Msb:) ↓ بَاقِيَةٌ, also, [pl. بَوَاقٍ and بَاقِيَاتٌ,] has
the same meaning as بَقِيَّةٌ; (TA;) [i. e., as explained above; and so has ↓ بَاقٍ, for شَىْءٍ بَاقٍ &c.]
You say, بَقِىَ مِنَ الشَّىْءِ بَقِيَّةٌ [explained before:
see 1]. (S.) [And هُمْ بَقِيَّةُ السَّيْفِ, and بَقَايَا السَّيْفِ,
They are those who have been spared by the
sword]. ―
-b2-  [Hence,] فُلَانٌ مِنْ بَقِيَّةِ القَوْمِ Such a
one is of the best of the people, or company of
men: because a man reserves the most excellent
of the things that he produces. (Bd in xi. 118.)
And فُلَانٌ مِنْ بَقِيَّةِ أَهْلِهِ Such a one is of the most
excellent of his people, or family. (Ham p. 78.)
And فُلَانٌ بَقِيَّةُ القَوْمِ Such a one is the best of the
people, or company of men: pl. بَقَايَا. (Kull
p. 96.) ―
-b3-  أُولُو بَقِيَّةٍ, in the Kur xi. 118, hence
means Persons possessed of excellence: [see a
phrase mentioned voce بَلَلٌ:] or possessing a relic
of judgment and intelligence: (Bd:) or persons
of religion and excellence: (Jel:) or persons of
understanding (K, TA) and discrimination: (TA:)
or persons of obedience: (TA:) or having the
quality of preserving themselves (Az, Bd, K, *)
from punishment, (Bd,) by their holding the
approved religion: (Az, TA:) and this last explanation is confirmed by another reading, which is
↓ اولوا بَقْيَةٍ [possessing a quality of watching, or
observing, and hence, of guarding, or preserving];
بَقْيَة being the inf. n. of un. of بَقَاهُ, aor. يَبْقِيهِ,
signifying “ he watched,” or “ observed,” &c.,
“ him,” or “ it. ” (Bd.) See also بُقَيَا, in two
places. بَقِيَّةٌ is also a subst. from أَبْقَيْتُ مَا بَيْنَنَا
[explained before: see 4: app. meaning Forbearance from marring much, or exceedingly, the state
of unity, or of amity, subsisting between two persons, or parties: and such may be its meaning in
the phrase above-mentioned (اولوا بقيّة)]. (K.) ―
-b4-
بَقِيَّةُ اللّٰهِ, in the Kur xi. 87, [after the command,
in the next preceding verse, to give full measure
and weight,] means God's sustenance that remains
for you after your giving full measure [and
weight]: (Jel:) or that which God has preserved
for you, of what is lawful, (Fr, Bd,) after [your]
keeping aloof from that which he has forbidden
you: (Bd:) or the good state, or condition, remaining for you: (Zj, K:) or the fear (مُرَاقَبَة)
of God; accord. to some: (Fr, TA:) or the
obedience of God, and (as Aboo-'Alee says, TA)
the looking for his recompense: (K, TA:) or
بَقِيَّةٌ and ↓ بَاقِيَةٌ signify any religious service
whereby one seeks to obtain the recompense of
God; and such is the meaning of the former in
this instance. (Er-Rághib, TA.) ―
-b5-  See also بَاقِيَةٌ.
بَاقٍ part. n. of بَقِىَ [in all its senses; Remaining,
continuing, lasting, or enduring: and permanent,
or perpetual; or continuing, lasting, or existing,
incessantly, always, endlessly, or for ever: &c.:
see 1]. (Er-Rághib, TA.) البَاقِى, a name of God,
[as also, pleonastically, البَاقِى الأَبَدِىُّ, means The
Everlasting, or] He whose existence will have no
end. (TA.) See also بَقِيَّةٌ. ―
-b2-  البَاقِى also signifies
The حَاصِل [or net produce, or perhaps simply
the produce,] of the [tax termed] خَرَاج, and the
like. (Lth, JK, TA.)
بَاقِيَةٌ: see بَقِيَّةٌ, first sentence. ―
-b2-  البَاقِيَاتُ الصَّالِحَاتُ
[in the Kur xviii. 44, and xix. 79,] means Any
righteous, or good, work, (K, TA,) of which the
recompense remains: (TA:) or acts of obedience,
(Bd and Jel in xix. 79,) or good works, (Bd in
xviii. 44,) of which the fruit remains for ever:
(Bd in both those places, and Jel * in the former:)
and, as included therein, [so Bd, but in the K
“ or,”] the five prayers; (Bd, K;) and the performance of the pilgrimage; and the keeping the
fast of Ramadán; (Bd in xviii. 44;) and [so
Bd, but in the K “ or,”] the saying, سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ
وَ الحَمْدُلِلّٰهِ وَ لَا إِلَّا اللّٰهُ وَ اللّٰهُ أَكْبَرُ; (Bd and Jel
in xviii. 44, and K;) to which some add, وَ لَا حَوْلَ
وَ لَا قُوَّةَ إِلَّا بِاللّٰهِ: (Jel ibid.:) or, accord. to Er-Rághib, the correct meaning is any religious
service whereby one seeks to obtain the recompense
of God: see also بَقِيَّةٌ, last explanation. (TA.)
―
-b3-  بَاقِيَةٌ is sometimes put in the place of an
inf. n.; (S, K;) or it is an inf. n.; (Msb;) syn.
with بَقَآءٌ; (S, Msb, TA;) with which ↓ بَقِيَّةٌ, also,
is syn. (TA in art. سرع.) So in the Kur [lxix. 8],
فَهَلْ تَرَى لَهُمْ مِنْ بَاقِيَةٍ [And dost thou see them to
have any continuance?]; (S, TA;) so says Fr:
(TA:) or, as some say, the meaning is, بَقِيَّةٍ [i. e.
a remnant]: (TA:) or جَمَاعَةٍ بَاقِيَةٍ [a company
remaining]: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or نَفْسٍ بَاقِيَةٍ [a
soul, or person, remaining]: (Bd, Jel:) or the ة
is an intensive affix; (Jel;) [or a restrictive to
unity;] i. e. one remaining; (Jel, TA;) and this
is also allowable and good: one says, likewise,
مَا بَقِيَتْ بَاقِيَةٌ وَ لَا وَ قَاهُمْ مِنَ اللّٰهِ وَاقِيَةٌ [One remaining remained not, nor did one preserver preserve
them from God]. (TA.)
أَبْقَى Longer continuing. (Bd and Jel in xx. 74,
&c.) ―
-b2-  هُوَ أَبْقَى الرَّجُلَيْنِ means أَكْثَرُ إِبْقَآءً عَلَى
قَوْمِهِ [He is the more merciful, or pitiful, or
compassionate, of the two men, towards his
people]. (TA.)
نَاقَةٌ مُبْقِيَةٌ A she-camel [that retains some milk;]
that does not exhaust her copious supply of milk.
(JK.) ―
-b2-  مُبْقِيَاتُ الخَيْلِ, (K,) or rather المُبْقِيَاتُ
مِنَ الخَيْلِ, (TA,) The horses whose running continues after the running of other horses has
ceased: (M, K:) or, that reserve somewhat of
their running. (T, TA.) ―
-b3-  And المُبْقِيَاتُ The
places that retain some of the pools in which
water has collected, and do not drink it up.
(TA.)
