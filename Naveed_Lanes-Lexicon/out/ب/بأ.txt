بأR. Q. 1
بَأْبَأَهُ, (Lth, T, S, M, K,) and بأبأ بِهِ,
(Fr, M, K,) inf. n. بَأْبَآَةُ (Lth, T, M) and بَئْبَآءٌ;
(Fr, M;) [as also بأَبِى; see art. بِأَبِى أَنْتَ;] He said to
him, بِأَبِي, (Fr, M,) or بأَبَا, (M,) or بِأَبِى أَنْتَ,
(Lth, T, K,) [all meaning With my father mayest
thou be ransomed! or] meaning أَفْدِيكَ بِأَبِى [I
will ransom thee with my father]; (Lth, T;) or
he said to him, بِأَبِى أَنْتَ وَأُمِّى [With my father
mayest thou be ransomed, and with my mother!
or I will ransom thee &c.; see art. ابو]; (S;) the
current phrase of the Arabs being that which
includes both parents: (TA:) i. e., a man said so
to another man, (Lth, T, M,) or to a child; (Fr,
S, M;) and in like manner to his horse, for having
saved him from some accident: (IAar, T:) the
verb is derived from بِأَبِى. (Lth, T, M.) Hence
البِأَبْ, in an ex. cited voce أَبٌ, in art. ابو, q. v.;
(M;) or البِئَبْ; (TA in art. ابو;) or البِيَبْ. (S
in that art.) ―
-b2-  And [hence,] بَأبَؤُوهُ They made a
show of treating him with graciousness, courtesy,
or blandishment; as also عَلَيْهِ ↓ تَبَأْبَؤُوا. (M.) ―
-b3-
[Hence also,] ↓ بَأْبَآءٌ, with medd, [used as an
inf. n.,] A woman's dandling, or dancing, of her
child. (AA, T.)
-A2-  بَأْبَأَ also signifies He (a child)
said ↓ بَأْبَأْ (M, K) [in some copies of the K written
بَابَا, both meaning Papa, or Father,] to his father.
(M.) [Accord. to the TA, the verb is trans. in
this sense, as in the senses before explained; but
I think that بَأْبَأَهُ has been there erroneously put
for بَأْبَأَ.] ―
-b2-  And He (a stallion [meaning a stallion-camel]) reiterated the sound of the letter ب
[or b] in his braying. (M.) ―
-b3-  [And hence, perhaps,] ↓ بَأْبَأٌ [or, more probably, ↓ بَأْبَآءٌ, with medd,
agreeably with analogy, used as an inf. n.,] The
chiding of the cat, or act of chiding the cat;
(AA, T, Sgh;) also termed غَسٌّ. (AA, T.)
-A3-
Also He hastened, made haste, or sped: and
↓ تَبَأْبَأْنَا we hastened, &c.: (marginal note in a
copy of the S:) or ↓ تَبَأْبَأَ signifies he ran. (ElUmawee, T, K.)
R. Q. 2
see above, in three places.
بَأْبأْ and بَأْبَأٌ: see R. Q. 1, in two places.
بُؤْبُؤٌ The source, origin, race, root, or stock,
syn. أَصْلٌ, (AA, Sh, T, S, M, K,) of a man, (Sh,
T,) whether noble or base. (AA, T.) You say,
هُوَ كَرِيمُ البُؤْبُؤِ He is of generous, or noble,
origin; lit., generous, or noble, of origin. (TK.)
And فُلَانٌ فِىبُؤْبُؤِ الكَرَمِ Such a one is of [a race]
the source (أَصْل) of generosity, or nobleness. (S.
[In the PS, من is here put in the place of فى:
but فى is often used in phrases of the same kind
and meaning as that above, in the sense of مِنْ.])
IKh cites from Jereer,
فِى يُؤْبُؤِ المَجْدِ وَبُحْبُوحِ الكَرَمْ
[Of a race the source of glory, and the very heart
of generosity, or nobleness]: but Aboo-'Alee El-
Kálee quotes the words thus;
فِى ضِئْضِئِ المَجْدِ وَ بُؤْبُوْءِ الكَرَمْ
[which may be rendered, of a race the source of
glory, and the very root of generosity]; whence
it appears that بُؤْبُوءٌ is a dial. var. of بُؤْبُؤٌ in the
sense here given. (TA.) ―
-b2-  The middle of a
thing; (K;) [and app. the heart, or very heart,
thereof; the middle as being the best part of a
thing;] like بُحْبُوحٌ. (TA.) ―
-b3-  [Hence, perhaps,]
The pupil, or apple, or the image that is seen
reflected in the black, (عَيْر AA, T, or إِنْسَان K,)
of the eye. (AA, T, K.) Whence the saying,
هُوَ أَعَزُّ عَلَىِّ مِنْ بُؤْبُؤِ عَيْنِى [He is dearer to me
than the apple of my eye; a saying common in
the present day, with the substitution of إِنْسَان
for بُؤْبُؤ]. (TA.) ―
-b4-  A generous, or noble, (ISk,
T,) or a clever, an ingenious, or an accomplished,
or a well-bred, or an elegant, (M, K,) and a light,
an active, or a sprightly, (M,) lord, master, chief,
or personage: (ISk, T, M, K:) fem. with ة.
(IKh, TA.) ―
-b5-  Also, (AA, T, S, * [but I find it
only in one of three copies of the S,]) or ↓ بُؤْبُؤْءٌ,
and ↓ بَأْبَآءٌ, (K,) the last from the M, (TA, [but
it is not in the M as transcribed in the TT,]) A
learned man (AA, T, S, K) who teaches; (AA,
T;) but the teaching of others is not a condition
required in the application of the epithet; (TA;)
like سَرْسُورٌ. (S [in which this last word is evidently given as a syn.: but in the K it is given
to show the form, only, of بُؤْبُوْءٌ].) ―
-b6-  Also The
body of a locust, (K,) without the head and legs.
(TA.) ―
-b7-  And, accord. to the K, The head, or
uppermost part, of a vessel in which [the collyrium
called] كُحْل is kept: but it will appear, in art.
يأ, that this is [perhaps] a mistranscription for يُؤْيُؤٌ.
(TA.)
