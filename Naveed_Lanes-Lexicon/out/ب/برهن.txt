برهنQ., or, as some say, Q. Q., 1.
Q. 1
بَرْهَنَ He adduced,
(T, Z, Msb,) or established, (S, K, and Ham p. 7,)
the بُرْهَان, (T, Z, Msb, K,) i. e. the evidence or
proof [&c.]; (T, S, Msb, &c.;) or he adduced
his evidence or proof [&c.]; (T, Msb;) عَلَيْهِ
[against him, or it, or (as in اِسْتَدَلَّ عَلَيْهِ) of it],
(S, K, and Ham p. 7,) and لَهُ [to him, or for
him]: (Ham ubi suprà:) but this verb is said
by Az and Z, on the authority of IAar, to be
post-classical; the correct word, they say, being
أَبْرَهَ: (Msb:) this they assert on the ground of
the opinion that بُرْهَانٌ [q. v.] is of the measure
فُعْلَانٌ; but J holds the ن to be a radical. (TA.)
بُرْهَانٌ An evidence, or a proof: (T, S, Msb, K,
and Ham p. 7:) and a demonstration; i. e. the
manifestation of an evidence or proof: (Msb:)
or a decisive and manifest evidence or proof:
(TA:) or the firmest, strongest, or most valid,
evidence or proof; which is such as ever necessarily implies truth, or veracity, as its consequence,
or concomitant; for evidences, or proofs, are of
five sorts; whereof this is one; another is that
which ever necessarily implies falsity, or falsehood, as its consequence, or concomitant; another,
that which is nearer to truth, or veracity; another,
that which is nearer to falsity, or falsehood; and
another, that which is intermediate between these
two: (Er-Rághib, TA:) [pl. بَرَاهِينُ:] some say
that the ن in this word is augmentative; (Msb, and
Ham p. 7;) that it is of the measure فُعْلَانٌ, from
البره [app. البَرْهُ] signifying the “act of cutting:”
(Ham ubi suprà:) others, that it is radical: Az
mentions both of these opinions: J confines
himself to the latter opinion: Z, to the former,
saying, on the authority of IAar, that the word
is derived from بَرَهْرَهَةٌ, meaning “white,” [or
“fair in complexion,”] applied to a girl: (Msb:)
Abu-l-Fet-h [i. e. IJ] says that he holds it to be
of the measure فُعْلَالٌ, like قُرْطَاسٌ and قُرْنَاسٌ, the
ن not being augmentative, as is shown by the
verb above mentioned: (Ham ubi suprà:) but [it
has been stated above that] this verb is said, on
the authority of IAar, to be post-classical. (Msb,
TA.)
