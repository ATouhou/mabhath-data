بندقQ. 1
بَنْدَقَ He made a thing into بَنَادِق [meaning bullets, or little balls], (Mgh, K,) or like
بنادق (TA.)
-A2-  [In post-classical Arabic, He
shot a bullet, or bullets, from a cross-bow or
other weapon.] ―
-b2-  بندق إِلَيْهِ (assumed tropical:)  He looked sharply,
or intently, at him, or it. (Ibn-'Abbád, K.)
بُنْدُقٌ [The hazel-nut; or hazel-nuts; so in the
present day;] a certain thing that is eaten;
(Msb;) i. q. جِلَّوْز: (IDrd, K:) or, as some say,
like جلّوز; brought from an island; the best
whereof is the fresh, heavy, white, and sweet
in taste; the old being bad: it is beneficial
as a remedy for palpitation, parched with
anise-seed; and for poisons, and wasting of the
kidneys, and burning of the urine; and with
pepper, it excites the venereal faculty; with
sugar, it removes cough; and the shell thereof,
burnt, and applied as a collyrium, sharpens the
sight: (TA:) they assert that the suspending
it upon the upper arm preserves from scorpions,
(K,) i. e., from their stinging: (TA:) the moistening of the top of the head of a child with the
powder of it when burnt, together with oil, removes the blueness of its eyes and the redness of
its hair: and the Indian kind thereof is an antidote very beneficial to the eyes: (K, TA:) but
in some copies of the K, [and so in the CK,]
instead of لِلْعَيْنَيْنِ, we here find لِلْعِنِّينِ [for the
impotent in respect of the venereal faculty]:
(TA:) [it is said in the Msb that most hold the
ن to be augmentative: but this is not the case;
for] the word is Persian [arabicized, from فُنْدُقْ]:
(K:) [it is a coll. gen. n.:] n. un. with ة: pl.
بَنَادِقُ. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  [Hence, Bullets, i. e.] certain
things that one shoots, (S, Msb, K,) made of clay:
(Msb:) n. un. with ة: (S, Msb, K:) the latter
signifies a piece of clay, made round, which one
shoots, or casts; or i. q. جُلَاهِقٌ: (Mgh:) it is
said in the Shifá el-Ghaleel to be an arabicized
word: (TA:) pl. as above. (S, Msb.) [See a
prov. voce حِدَأَةٌ. Hence قَوْسُ البُنْدُقِ The crossbow. In modern Arabic, بُنْدُق is also applied to
Balls of any kind of the size of hazel-nuts: n. un.
with ة.]
بُنْدُقِىٌّ A garment, or piece of cloth, of fine,
delicate, or thin, linen. (Sgh, K.) [SM says,]
It is most probably, in my opinion, so called in
relation to the land of البُنْدُقِيَّة [or Venice]. (TA.)
[In modern Arabic, A Venetian sequin: pl.
بَنَادِقَةٌ.]
بُنْدَقَانِىٌّ [app. a post-classical word,] A maker
of cross-bows (قِسِىّ البُنْدُق). (El-Makreezee's
Khitat, art. خطّ البندقانيّين.)
