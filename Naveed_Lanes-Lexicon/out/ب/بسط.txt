بَسْطٌ, (S, M, Msb,) contr. of تَبْسيِطٌ; (M, TA;) as

also ↓بسّطهُ: (K:) and he made it wide, or
ample: these are the primary significations; and
sometimes both of them may be conceived; and
sometimes, one of them: and the verb is also
used, metaphorically, as relating to anything
which cannot be conceived as composed or constructed: (B:) and بَصْطٌ is the same as بَسْطٌ, (S,
and K in art. بصط,) in all its meanings. (K.)
You say, بَسَطَ الثَّوْبَ [He spread, spread out,
expanded, or unfolded, the garment, or piece of

(M, TA.) بَسْطُ اليَدِ and الكَفِّ is sometimes used
to denote assaulting and smiting: [as in the last

بِالسُّوْءِ (tropical:) [And they will stretch forth towards you
their hands and their tongues with evil]; (TA;)
i. e., by slaying, (Bd, Jel,) and smiting, (Jel,)
and reviling. (Bd, Jel.) And sometimes to denote
giving liberally: (TA:) [as in] بَسَطَ يَدَهُ فِى الإَنْفَاقِ
(tropical:) He [stretched forth his hand, opened, or] was
liberal or bountiful or munificent [in expenditure]:
(Msb:) see بَسِيطٌ, below. (TA.) And sometimes
to denote taking, or taking possession, or seizing:
as in the saying, (TA,) بُسِطَتْ يَدُهُ عَلَيْهِ (tropical:) [His
hand was stretched forth against him]; i. e. he
was made to have dominion over him by absolute
force and power. (K, TA.) And sometimes to
denote seeking, or demanding: [as in بَسَطَ كَفَّيْهِ
فِى الدُّعَآءِ (tropical:) He expanded his two hands in supplication; a common action, in which the two hands
are placed together like an open book upon a desk
before the face, in supplicating God:] see بَاسِطٌ,

(tropical:) I displayed, or laid open, to him my state, or
case, or affair; syn. فَرَشْتُهُ إِيَّاهُ: (A in art. فرش:)

بَسَطَ قَلْبَهُ (assumed tropical:)  It dilated his heart: see remarks on
قَبْضٌ and بَسْطٌ, as used by certain of the Soofees,
near the end of 1 in art. قبض. And] بَسَطَهُ, alone,
[signifies the same; or] (tropical:) it rejoiced him; rendered him joyous, or cheerful: (M, K, TA:)
because, when a man is rejoiced, his countenance
becomes unwrinkled (يَنْبَسِطُ), and he becomes
changed [and cheerful] in [its] complexion: it is
wrongly said, by MF, to be not tropical: that it
is tropical is asserted by Z, in the A: MF also
says that it is not post-classical; and in this he is
right; for it occurs in a saying of Mohammad:
thus in a trad. respecting Fátimeh, يَبْسُطُنِى مَا
يَبْسُطُهَا What rejoices her rejoices me: (TA:)
[see also قَبَضَهُ, where this saying is cited according
to another relation:] ↓أَبْسَطَنِى [as signifying (tropical:)  it
rejoiced me] is a mistake of the vulgar [obtaining
in the present day]. (TA.) ―

aversion; boldly; in a free and easy manner; or
cheerfully]: (TA:) he met him laughingly, or
smilingly, so as to show his teeth. (So accord. to
