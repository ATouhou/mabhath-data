بَعَدَ, inf. n. بَعَدٌ; (L, K;) and ↓ ابعد,
inf. n. إِبْعَادٌ, which is also trans.; (Msb;) and
↓ تباعد; (S, Msb, K;) and ↓ استبعد; (S, K, &c.;)

off, or aloof: he went, or removed, or retired, or
withdrew himself, to a distance, or far away,
or far off: he alienated, or estranged, himself:
he stood, or kept, aloof: contr. of قَرُبَ: (S, L:)
[but بَعُدَ generally has the first of these significations; and ↓ ابعد, the others, as also ↓ تباعد
and ↓ استبعد:] it is the general opinion of the
leading lexicologists that بَعِدَ, as well as بَعُدَ, is
thus used; but some deny this; and some assert
that they may be employed alike, but that بَعُدَ is
more chaste than بَعِدَ thus used. (TA.) [You
say also, of a desert, and a tract of country, and
the like, بَعُدَ, meaning It extended far.] And
زَيْدٌ عَنِ المَنْزِلِ ↓ ابعد, meaning ↓ تباعد [i. e. Zeyd
went, or removed, to a distance, or far, from the
place of alighting or abode]. (IKt, Msb.) And
مِنِّى ↓ تباعد, and ↓ ابتعد, and ↓ تبعّد, [He went, or
removed, to a distance, or far, from me; he alienated, or estranged, himself from me; he shunned,
or avoided, me;] (A;) and عَنِّى ↓ تباعد [and بَعُدَ
عنّى signify the same]. (Msb in art. كشح.)
And ↓ إِذَا أَرَاذَ أَحَدُكُمْ الحَاجَةِ أَبْعَدَ, (L, Msb,)
a trad., (Msb,) meaning When one of you desires
to accomplish that which is needful, (i. e. to ease
nature,) he goes far, or to a great distance. (L.)
And فِى المَذْهَبِ ↓ أَبْعَدْتُ, meaning ↓ تَبَاعَدْتُ,
(Msb,) I went far, or to a great distance, to the
place of ease, i. e., to ease nature. (L.) ―
-b2-  [بَعُدَ
referring to a saying or the like, and an event,
means It was far from being probable or correct;
it was improbable, extraordinary, or strange:
(see بَعِيدٌ, and see also 10:) often occurring in
these senses.] And فِى نَوْعِهِ ↓ ابعد It reached the
utmost point, or degree, in its kind, or species.
(IAth.) And ابعد فِى السَّوْمِ He exceeded the
due bounds in offering a thing for sale and demanding a price for it, or in bargaining for a
thing. (A.) ―
-b3-  أَخَذَهُ مَا قَرُبَ وَ مَا بَعُدَ Recent and
old griefs took hold upon him: a saying similar
to أَخَذَهُ مَا قَدُمَ وَ مَا حَدُثَ. (Mgh in art. قدم.)
―
-b4-  [بَعُدَ is often used, agreeably with a general
rule, in the manner of a verb of praise or dispraise;
and in this case is commonly contracted into بُعْدَ,
like حُسْنَ; as in the phrase, in a verse of Imrael-Keys, بُعْدَ مَا مُتَأَمَّلى (in which ما is redundant)
Distant, or far distant, was the object of my
contemplation! or (as explained in the EM p. 52)
how distant, &c.!] ―
-b5-  بَعِدَ, aor.
بَعَدَ, inf. n. بَعَدٌ;
(S, L, Msb, K;) and بَعْدَ, aor.
بَعُدَ, inf. n. بُعْدٌ; (L,
K;) also signify He, or it, perished: (S L, Msb:)
he died: (K:) it is the general opinion of the
leading lexicologists that both these verbs are
used as signifying “he perished,” and both occur
in different readings of v. 98 of ch. xi. of the Kur:
the former is said to be used in this sense by some
of the Arabs; and the latter, by others; but some
disallow the latter in this sense; and some say
that the former is more chaste than the latter thus
used: (TA:) or both signify he became far distant
from his home or native country; became a
stranger, or estranged, therefrom: (L, TA:) or
the Arabs say, بَعِدَ الرَّجُلُ and بَعُدَ in the sense of
تباعد, when not reviling; but when reviling, they
say, بَعِدَ, only. (Yoo, TA.) You say, لَا تَبْعَدٌ
وَ إِنْ بَعُدْتَ عَنَّى [Mayest thou not perish though
thou be distant from me!] (A.) [And as an
imprecation against a man, you say, بَعِدْتَ, meaning Mayest thou perish! (See the printed edition
of the Ham, pp. 89 and 90, where بَعِدْتَاىَ هلكت
is an evident mistake for َعِدْتَ أَى هَلَكْتَ.)] And
بُعْدًا لَهُ May God alienate him, or estrange
him, from good, or prosperity! or, curse him!
(A, * K, TA;) i. e. may he not be pitied with
respect to that which has befallen him! like
سُحْقًا لَهُ: the most approved way being to put
بعد thus in the accus. case as an inf. n.; but
the tribe of Temeem say, لَهُ ↓ بُعْدٌ, and سُحْقٌ, like
غُلَامٌ لَهُ. (TA.)

far away, or far off; he placed, or put, at a
distance, or he put, or sent, away, or far away,
or far off, or he removed far away, alienated,

or avoid thou, Zeyd]: and زَيْدًا عَنْكَ ↓ بَاعِدْ
[Remove thou Zeyd far from thee]. (TA, voce

two far extending! may He make a wide separation between them two!]; as also ↓ بَعَّدَ. (TA.)
And بَيْنَ أَسْفَارِنَا ↓ رَبَّنَا بَاعِدْ, or ↓ بَعِّدْ, [O our
Lord, make to be far-extending the spaces between
our journeys! or, put wide distances between our
journeys!] accord. to different readings [in the
Kur xxxiv. 18]: the former of these is the common
reading: Yaakoob El-Hadramee read ↓ رَبُّنَا بَاعَدَ
الخ [Our Lord, He hath made to be far extending &c.]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  أَبْعَدَهُ اللّٰهُ means May God
alienate him, or estrange him, from good, or

استبعدهُ He reckoned it, or esteemed it,
(namely, a thing, K, or a saying, A,) بَعِيد [i. e.

extraordinary, or strange]; (S, A, K;) as also
↓ ابعدهُ. (A.)
-A2-  See also 1, first sentence, in two
places.
بَعْدُ an adv. n. of time, signifying After, or
afterwards: and allowable also, accord. to some
of the grammarians, as an adv. n. of place, signifying after, or behind: (TA:) contr. of قَبْلُ:
(S, A, K:) it is a vague adv. n., of which the
meaning is not understood without its being prefixed to another noun [expressed or implied]; denoting after-time. (Msb.) When it occurs without any complement, (S, K,) a noun or the like
which should be its complement being intended
to be understood as to the meaning thereof but
not as to the letter, (S, * TA,) it is indecl., (S,
K,) because it resembles a particle, (TA,) and
has damm for its termination to show that it is
indecl., since it cannot have damm by any rule
of desinential syntax because it cannot occur as
an agent nor as an inchoative or enunciative.
(S.) Sb, however, mentions [as exceptions to
this rule] the phrases مِنْ بَعْدٍ [Afterwards] and
أَفْعَلُ هٰذَا بَعْدًا [I will do this afterwards], as
having been used by the Arabs. (K, * TA.) [The
latter of these phrases is common in the present
day. Another exception to the rule above-mentioned will be found in what follows.] Accord.
to the primary rule, it is used as a prefixed n.
governing its complement in the gen. case; (S;)
[i. e., it is used in the manner of a preposition;]
and when thus used, it is decl., (K,) because it
does not in this case [always] resemble a particle.
(TA.) You say, جَآءَ زَيْدٌ بَعْدَ عَمْرٍو Zeyd came
after 'Amr. (Msb.) And رَأَيْتُهُ بَعْدَكَ and مِنْ
بَعْدِكَ [I saw him after thee]. (L.) The words
of the Kur [xxx. 3], اللّٰهِ الْأَمْرُ مِنْ قَبْلُ وَ مِنْ بَعْدُ,
meaning To God belonged the command before
that the Greeks were overcome and after that
they had been overcome, [thus read when the
complements of قبل and بعد are intended to be
understood as to the meaning thereof but not as
to the letter,] are also read مِنْ قَبْلِ وَ مِنْ بَعْدِ,
when each complement is intended to be understood as to the meaning and the letter, and also
مِنْ قَبْلٍ وَ مِنْ بَعْدٍ, meaning To God belongeth the
command first and last, [when neither complement
is intended to be understood either as to the letter or
as to the meaning,] but the first of these readings
is the best. (L.) [You say also, بَعْدَ ذٰلِكَ and مِنْ
بَعْدِ ذٰلِكَ After that: and بَعْدَ أَنْ فَعَلْتُ and مِنْ
بَعْدِ أَنْ فَعَلْتُ and بَعْدَ مَا فَعَلْتُ and مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا
فَعَلْتُ After I did, or after my doing, such
a thing: &c.] Also جِئْتُ بَعْدَيْكُمَا, meaning
بَعْدَ كُمَا, I came after you two. (K.) And هٰذَا مِمَّا
لَيْسَ بَعْدَهُ غَايَةٌ فِى الجَوْدَةِ, and فِى الرَّدَآءَة, This is
of the things after, or beyond, which there is not
any extreme degree in respect of goodness, and
in respect of badness: and, by way of abridgement, لَيْسَ بَعْدَهُ [with nothing following this]:
and hence, app., the saying of Mohammad, وَإِنْ
كَانَ لَيْسَ بِالَّذِى لَا بَعْدَ لَهُ, meaning [And though]
it be not in the utmost degree in respect of goodness: بعد being thus used as a decl. noun. (Mgh.)
[
بَعْدِى and the like are also frequently used as
meaning بَعْدَ عَهْدِى and the like; as in the
phrase, قَدْ تَغَيَّرْتَ بَعْدى Thou hast become altered
since I knew thee, or saw thee, or met thee, or
was with thee. And similar to this are many
phrases in the Kur; as, for instance, in ii. 48,]
ثُمَّ اتَّخَذْتُمُ العِجْلَ مِنْ بَعْدِهِ Then ye took to
yourselves the calf as a god, or an object of worship, after him, namely Moses, i. e., after his
having gone away. (Bd.) أَمَّا بَعْدُ (S, K, &c.) is
[an expression denoting transition;] an expression by which an address or a discourse is divided;
(S;) used without any complement to بعد,
which in this case signifies the contr. of قَبْلُ:
(TA:) you say, أَمَّا بَعْدُ فَقَدْ كَانَ كَذَا, meaning
[Now, after these preliminary words, (Abu-l-
'Abbás in TA voce خِطَابٌ,) I proceed to say,
that such a thing has happened: or] after my
prayer for thee: (K:) or after praising God:
(TA:) the first who used this formula was David;
(K;) or Jacob; (TA;) or Kaab Ibn-Lu-eí; (K;)
or Kuss Ibn-Sá'ideh; or Yaarub Ibn-Kahtán.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  You also use the dim. form, saying
↓ بُعَيْدَهُ [A little after him, or it], when you
mean by it to denote a time near to the preceding
time. (Msb.) You say also, بَيْنٍ ↓ رَأَيْتُهُ بُعَيْدَاتِ,
(S, K,) and ↓ بَعِيدَاتِهِ, (K, TA, [in the CK
بُعَيْدَاتِه,]) I saw him a little after a separation:
(S, K:) or, after intervals of separation: (S, L:)
or, after a while. (A'Obeyd, A.) And إِنَّهَا لَتَضْحَكُ
بَيْنٍ ↓ بُعَيْذَاتِ Verily she laughs after intervals.
(L.) [See also art. بين.] ↓ بُعَيْدَات is used only as
an adv. n. of time. (S, L.) ―
-b3-  بَعْدُ also sometimes
means Now; yet; as yet. (TA.) [It is used
in this sense mostly in negative phrases; as, for
instance, in لَمْ يَمُتْ بَعْدُ He has not died yet.
The following is one of the instances of its having
this meaning in affirmative phrases: سُمِّيَ الحَوْلِىُّ
مِنْ أَوْلَادِ البَقَرِ تَبِيعًا لِأَنَّهُ يَنْبَعُ أُمَّهُ بَعْدُ The yearling
of the offspring of cows is called تبيع because he
yet follows his mother: occurring in the Mgh
&c., in art. تبع.] ―
-b4-  It occurs also in the sense
of مَعَ; as in the words of the Kur [ii. 174 and
v. 95], فَمَنِ اعْتَدَى بَعْدَ ذٰلِكَ, i. e., (as some say,
MF,) مَعَ ذلك [And whoso transgresseth notwithstanding that; lit., with that]. (Msb.) ―
-b5-  It has
been said that it also means Before, in time;
thus bearing two contr. significations: that it has
this meaning in two instances; in the Kur
[lxxix. 30], where it is said, وَ الْأَرْضَ بَعْدَ ذٰلِكَ
دَحَاهَا [as though signifying And the earth, before
that, He spread it forth]; and [xxi. 105] where
it is said, وَلَقَدْ كَتَبْنَا فِى الزَّبُورِ مِنْ بَعْدِ الذِّكْرِ
[as though meaning And verily we wrote in the
Psalms before the Kur-án]: (MF, TA:) but Az
says that this is a mistake; that God created the
earth not spread forth; then created the heaven;
and then spread forth the earth: (L, TA:) and
الذكر in the latter of these instances means the
Book of the Law revealed to Moses: (Bd:) or
الزبور means the revealed Scriptures; (Bd, Jel;)
and الذكر, the Preserved Tablet, (Bd,) [i. e.]
the Original of the Scriptures, which is with
God. (Jel.)
بُعْدٌ [as an inf. n. used in the manner of a
subst. signifies] Distance, or remoteness; (S, A,
L, K; *) and so ↓ بَعَدٌ, (L, K,) accord. to most
of the leading lexicologists, (TA, [see بَعْدَ,]) [and
↓ بُعْدَةٌ, for] you say, بَيْنَنَا بُعْدَةٌ, meaning [Between
us two is a distance] of land or country, or of
relationship. (S, K.) ―
-b2-  [Remoteness from probability or correctness; improbability, or strangeness: see بَعُدَ. Hence the phrase, هٰذَا مِنَ البُعْدِ
بِمَكَانٍ This is improbable, or extraordinary, or
strange: often occurring in the TA &c.] ―
-b3-  Also
i. q. ↓ بُعْدٌ: (L, K:) this latter (S, L, Msb, K)
and بُعْدٌ, (L, K,) accord. to most of the leading
lexicologists, as, for instance, in the Kur xi. 98,
(TA, [see بَعِدَ,]) signifying Perdition; (S, L,
Msb;) or death. (K.) ―
-b4-  Judgment and prudence; as also ↓ بُعْدَةٌ: so in the phrase, إِنَّهُ لَذُو
بُعْدٍ, and بُعْدَةٍ, Verily he is possessed of judgment
and prudence: (K:) or penetrating, or effective,
judgment; depth, or profundity; far-reaching
judgment. (TA.) [See also أَبْعَدُ.] ↓ ذُو البُعْدَةِ
also signifies A man who goes to a great length,
or far, in hostility. (L.) ―
-b5-  A cursing; execration; malediction; as also ↓ بِعَادٌ. (K.) You
say, بُعْدٌ لَهُ, as well as بُعْدًا لَهُ: see 1, last sentence
but one. (TA.)

بِعَادٌ: see بُعْدٌ.
بَعِيدٌ Distant; remote; far; far off; (S, L,
K; *) as also ↓ بُعَادٌ, and ↓ بَاعِدٌ: (L, K:) pl. (of
the first, S, L) بُعْدَانٌ (S, L, K) and (of the first
also, L, TA) بُعُدٌ (L, K) and بِعَادٌ (TA) and (of
the first and second, L) بُعَدَآءُ (L, K) and of the
third, ↓ بَعَدٌ, [but this (which is also used as a sing.
epithet, as will be shown in what follows,) is
properly a quasi-pl. n.,] like as خَدَمٌ is of خَادِمٌ.
(S.) As signifying Distant with respect to place,
it is correctly used alike as masc. and fem. and
sing. and dual and pl.; (L, and TA in this art.
and in art. قرب, in which latter see the authorities;) but not necessarily; like its contr. قَرِيبٌ:
(L:) you say, هِىَ بَعِيدٌ مِنْكَ [She is distant from
thee; or it is] as though you said, مَكَانُهَا بَعِيدٌ:
(L:) also مَا أَنْتَ مِنَّا بِبَعِيدٍ [Thou art not distant
from us ], and مَا أَنْتُمْ مِنَّا بِبَعِيدٍ [Ye are not
distant from us]: and in like manner, مَا أَنْتَ
↓ مِنَّا بِبَعَدٍ, and ↓ مَا أَنْتُمُ مِنَّا بِبَعَدٍ. (S, TA.)
[But it receives, sometimes, the fem. form when
used in this sense; for] جَلَسْتُ بَعِيدًا مِنْكَ and
بَعِيدَةٌ مِنْكَ are phrases mentioned as signifying
I sat distant, or remote in place, or at a distance,
or aloof, from thee; مَكَانًا [and نَاحِيَةً or the like]
being understood. (L.) You say also, ↓ مَنْزِلٌ بَعَدٌ
A distant, or remote, place of alighting or abode.
(K.) And تَنَحَّ غَيْرَ بَعِيدٍ (S, K) and ↓ غَيْرَ بَاعِدٍ
and ↓ غَيْرَ بَعَدٍ (K) [Retire thou not far;] meaning be thou near: (S, K:) [or] the second and
third of these phrases mean retire thou not in
an abject, or a mean, or contemptible, or despicable, state. (S, A.) And ↓ اِنْطَلِقْ يَا فُلَانُ غَيْرَ بَاعِدٍ
[Depart thou, O such a one, not far;] meaning
mayest thou not go away! (L.) [And رَأَيْتُهُ مِنْ
بَعِيدٍ I saw him, or it, from afar: and جَآءَ مِنْ
بَعِيدٍ He came from afar: and the like. And
بَعِيدٌ as applied to a desert and the like, meaning
Far extending.] And ↓ بُعْدٌ بَاعِدٌ A far distance.
(K.) [And نِيَّةٌ بَعِيدَةٌ A distant, far-reaching, or
far-aiming, intention, purpose, or design.] And
فُلَانٌ بَعِيدُ الهِمَّةِ [Such a one is far-aiming, or faraspiring, in purpose, desire, or ambition]. (A.)
And هِىَ بَعِيدَةُ العَهْدِ [She was known, or seen, or
met, a long time ago]: in this case, the fem.
form, with ة, must be used. (L.) And قَوْلٌ بَعِيدٌ
[A saying far from being probable or correct; improbable; far-fetched; extraordinary, or strange].
(A.) And أَمْرٌ بَعِيدٌ An extraordinary thing or
affair or case, of which the like does not happen
or occur. (L.) ―
-b2-  Also Distant with respect to
kindred or relationship: in which sense, the word
receives the fem. form, [as well as the dual form,
and pl. forms, like its contr. قَرِيبٌ,] by universal
consent. (TA.) [Its pl.] بُعَدَآءُ signifies Strangers,
that are not relations. (IAth.) You say also,
فُلَانٌ مِنْ بُعْدَانِ الأَمِيرِ [meaning Such a one is
of the distant dependents, or subjects, of the governor, or prince]. (S.) And إِذَا لَمْ تَكُنْ مِنْ قُرْبَانِ
الأَمِيرِ فَكُنْ مِنْ بُعْدَانِهِ [If thou be not of the particular companions, or familiars, of the governor,
or prince, then be of his distant dependents, or
subjects]; i. e., be distant from him, that his evil
may not affect thee. (AZ, A.) ―
-b3-  رَأَيْتُهُ بَعِيدَاتِ
بَيْنٍ: see بَعْدٌ in the latter half of the paragraph.
―
-b4-  See also بَاعِدٌ.
بُعَيْد and بُعَيْدَات: see بَعْدُ in four places.
بَاعِدُ: see بَعِيدٌ in four places. ―
-b2-  Also Perishing: (S, L: [in the K it is implied that it signifies
dying; and so ↓ بَعِيدٌ and ↓ بُعَادٌ:]) or far distant
from his home, or native country; in a state of
estrangement therefrom. (L.)
أَبْعَدُ More, and most, distant or remote; further, and furthest: by poetic licence written أَبْعَدُّ:
(L:) [pl. أَبَاعِدُ; as in the saying,] فُلَانٌ يَسْتَجِرُّ
الحَدِيثَ مِنْ أَبَاعِدِ أَطْرَافِهِ [Such a one draws forth
talk, or discourse, or news, or the like, from its
most remote sources]. (A.) ―
-b2-  More, and most,
extreme, excessive, egregious, or extraordinary,
in its kind. (IAth.) [Hence, perhaps,] إِنَّهُ لَغَيْرُ
أَبْعَدَ [in the CK أَبْعَدٍ] and ↓ بُعَدٍ Verily there is
no good in him: (K:) or, no depth in him in
anything: (IAar:) [or, he is not extraordinary
in his kind: see also بُعْدٌ:] said in dispraising one.
(TA.) And مَا عِنْدَهُ أَبْعَدُ and ↓ بُعَدٌ [He has not
what is extraordinary in its kind: or] he possesses
not excellence, or power, or riches: or he possesses
not anything profitable: (L, K:) said only in
dispraising one: (AZ:) or it may mean he possesses not anything which one would go far to
seek; or, anything of value: or what he possesses,
of things or qualities that are desirable, is more
extraordinary than what others possess. (MF.)
―
-b3-  Remote from good: [which is the meaning
generally intended in the present day when it is
used absolutely as an epithet applied to a man;
but meaning also remote from him or those in
whose presence this epithet is used, both as to
place and as to moral condition:] and, from
continence: (L:) and stupid; foolish; or having
little, or no, intellect or understanding; syn. حَائِنٌ:
(so in a copy of the S and in the L and TA:) or
treacherous, or unfaithful; syn. خَائِنٌ (So in
two copies of the S and in a copy of the A.) It is
used as an allusion to the name of a person whom
one would mention with dispraise; as when one
says, هَلَكَ الأَبْعَدُ [May such a one, the remote
from good, &c., perish!]: with respect to a woman,
one says, هَلَكَتِ البُعْدَى. (En-Nadr, Az.) One
says also, كَبَّ اللّٰهُ الأَبْعَدَ لِفِيهِ, meaning [May
God cast down prostrate such a one, the remote
from good, &c., upon his mouth! or,] cast him
down upon his face! (S.) [It is a rule observed
in decent society, by the Arabs, to avoid, as much
as possible, the mention of opprobrious epithets,
lest any person present should imagine an epithet
of this kind to be slily applied to himself: therefore, when any malediction or vituperation is
uttered, it is usual to allude to the object by the
term الأَبْعَد, or البَعِيد, as meaning the remote
from good, &c., and also the remote from the
person or persons present. See also الأَخِرُ, which
is used in a similar manner.] ―
