بدل1
بَدَلَ, inf. n. بَدَالٌ: see 2, in three places.
2
تَبْدِيلٌ properly signifies [The changing, or
altering, a thing; or] the changing, or altering,
the form, or fashion, or semblance, or the quality,
or condition, [of a thing,] to another form, &c.,
while the substance remains the same; (Th, T,
TA;) or the changing a thing from its state, or
condition; (Ibn-'Arafeh, TA;) or the changing
a thing without substitution: (S:) but the Arabs
have used it also in the sense of ↓ إِبْدَالٌ, (Mbr,
T, TA,) which signifies [the changing a thing by
substitution; exchanging it; replacing it with
another thing; or] the removing, or displacing,
the substance [of a thing], and introducing anew
another substance. (Th, T, TA.) You say, بَدَّلْتُهُ,
inf. n. تَبْدِيلٌ, (M, * Msb, K,) meaning I changed
it, or altered it; (M, K) or I changed, or
altered, the form, or fashion, or semblance, or
the quality, or condition, of it; (Msb;) as in
the phrase, بَدَّلْتُ الخَاتَمَ بِالحَلْقَةِ [I changed, or
altered, the signet-ring into the simple ring], said
when one has melted the former and made of
it a simple ring; (Fr, T, TA;) and بَدَّلَ اللّٰهُ
السَّيِئَّاتِ حَسَنَاتٍ [God changed the evil deeds into
good deeds]; the verb being doubly trans. by
itself because it has the meaning of جَعَلَ and
صَيَّرَ. (Msb. [But see what follows.]) ↓ أَبْدَلْتُهُ
بِكَذَا, [in the S, أَبْدَلْتُ الشَّىْءَ بِغَيْرِهِ, without explanation,] inf. n. إِبْدَالٌ, [I changed it by substituting for it such a thing, or exchanged it for
such a thing, or replaced it with such a thing,]
is said when one has removed the first, and put
the second in its place; (Msb;) as in the phrase,
أَبْدَلْتُ الخَاتَمَ بِالحَلْقَةِ [I changed the signet-ring
by substituting for it the simple ring; exchanged
the signet-ring for the simple ring; or replaced
the signet-ring with the simple ring]; said when
one removes the one, and puts the other in its
place: (Fr, T, TA:) and this verb is also made
doubly trans. by itself, like بَدَّلْتُ, (Msb,) which
is used in the sense of أَبْدَلْتُ [as shown above];
(Mbr, T, TA;) for instance, where it is said, [in
the Kur lxvi. 5,] عَسَى رَبُّهُ إِنْ طَلَّقَكُنَّ أَنْ يُبْدِلَهُ
أَزْوَجًا خَيْرًا مِنْكُنَّ [May-be, his Lord, if he divorce
you, will give him in exchange wives better than
you]; accord to one reading, يُبَدِّلَهُ (Msb.) An
ex. of the latter of these two verbs in the sense
of the former is the saying in the Kur [xxv. 70],
يُبَدِّلُ اللّٰهُ سَيِّآتِهِمْ حَسَنَاتٍ [God will change their
evil deeds by substituting for them good deeds];
i. e. will cancel the evil deeds and put in their
place good deeds: but in the saying in the Kur
[iv. 59], كُلَّمَا نَضِجَتْ جُلُودُهُمْ بَدَّلْنَاهُمْ جُلُودًا
غَيْرَهَا [Whenever their skins are thoroughly burned,
we will change the condition thereof to them into
the condition of other skins], the meaning is, that
the first condition of their skins shall be restored;
so that the substance is one, but the condition is
different. (Mbr, T, TA.) You say also, بَدَّلَهُ اللّٰهُ
مَنَ الخَوْفِ أَمْنًا [God gave him in exchange for
fear, or in lieu of fear, security]. (S.) [And
بَدَّلَهُ بِهِ كَذَا He gave him in exchange for it,
or in lieu of it, such a thing: see Kur xxxiv. 15.
And بدّل مَكَانَهُ كَذَا He gave in exchange for it,
or in lieu of it, such a thing: see Kur vii. 93
and xvi. 103.] بَدَّلَ حُسْنًا بَعْدَ سُوْءٍ, in the Kur
[xxvii. 11], means He hath done good [by way
of exchange after evil]; i. e., repented; (Jel;)
or بَدَّلَ ذَنْبُهُ بِالتَوْبَةِ [hath exchanged his sin for
repentance]. (Bd.) تَبْدِيلٌ and ↓ إِبْدَالٌ both
signify The act of exchanging [a thing for another
thing]; or making [a thing] to be a substitute
[for another thing]; (KL, PS;) and so does
↓ بَدَالٌ. (KL.) You say, بدّل الشَّىْءَ مِنَ الشَىْءِ,
(M, K, *) and مِنْهُ ↓ ابدلهُ, i. e. اِتَّخَذَهُ مِنْهُ بَدلًا
[here meaning He exchanged the thing for the
thing; or, more literally, he made the thing a
substitute for the thing]. (M, K. [In the text
of the former of these, as given in the TT, instead
of اِتَّخَذَهُ, I find تَخِذَ (a dial. var. of اِتَّخَذَ) without the affixed pronoun, which is meant to be
understood or is omitted inadvertently by the
transcriber: and here it should be observed, that
the explanation which I have rendered as above
admits of another meaning, namely, أَخَذَهُ مِنْهُ بَدَلًا
“he took it as a substitute for it:” in the M,
immediately before, أَخَذَهُ مِنْهُ بَدَلًا is given as the
explanation of the phrases تبدّل الشَّىْءَ and بِالشَّىْءِ,
and استبدلهُ and بِهِ: see 10.]) You say also,
الثَّوْبَ بِغَيْرِهِ ↓ بَدَلْتُ, aor.
بَدُلَ, [inf. n. بَدَالٌ, mentioned and explained above, I exchanged the garment, or piece of cloth, for another; or made it
to be a substitute for another;] and ↓ اِسْتَبْدَلْتُهُ
بِغَيْرِهِ signifies the same. (Msb. [But the latter
phrase has more frequently another meaning, explained below: see 10.]) [↓ ابدلهُ in the phrases
ابدلهُ كَذَا as meaning He changed it into, or
substituted for it, such a thing, and ابدلهُ مِنْ كَذَا
as meaning he changed it from, or substituted it
for, such a thing, is more common than بدّله,
which is used in the same sense; as ↓ بَدَلَهُ is
also; for] AO applies the term ↓ مَبْدُولٌ [in lieu
of the more common term ↓ مُبْدَلٌ] to a letter
that is changed from another letter, as in مَدَهْتُهُ
for مَدَحْتُهُ; and this shows that بَدَلْتُ is trans.
[and signifies I changed, &c.]. (Az, TA.)
3
مُبَادَلَةٌ and ↓ تَبَادَلٌ signify the same, (S,)
namely, The act of exchanging with another or
others. (PS.) You say, بادلهُ, inf. n. مُبَادَلَةٌ and
بِدَالٌ [in the CK erroneously written with fet-h
to the ب], He exchanged, or made an exchange,
with him; or] he gave him the like of that which
he took, or received, from him; (IDrd, * M, K;)
for instance, a garment, or piece of cloth, in the
place of another; (Lth, T, Msb, * in explanation
of the former inf. n.;) and a brother in the place
of a brother. (Lth, T.) And ↓ تَبَادَلَا They exchanged, or made an exchange, each with the
other; or each gave to the other the like of that
which he took, or received, from him. (TA.)
نُبَادِلُهْ, ending a verse of El-Kulákh, means for
whom we would take a substitute: El-Marzookee
says, it is for نُبَادِلُ بِهِ النَّاسَ [for whom we would
make an exchange with the people]; the preposition being suppressed. (Ham p. 465.)
4
ابدلهُ, inf. n. إِبْدَالٌ: see 2, in five places.
5
تبدّل It (a thing, M) became changed, or
altered. (M, K.) ―
-b2-  In the saying of the rájiz,
فَبُدِّلَتْ وَالدَّهْرُ ذُو تَبَدُّلِ
the meaning is, ذو تَبْدِيل [i. e. the meaning of
the whole is, And, or but, she was changed, or
altered; for time has the property of changing,
or altering]. (M.)
-A2-  See also 10, in three places.

تَبَاْدَلَ see 3, in two places.
10
استبدل الشَّىْءَ and
بِالشَّىْءِ, and ↓ تبدّلهُ and
بِهِ, (M, K, *) He took a substitute, or a thing in
exchange, for the thing. (M.) You say, استبدل
الشَّىْءَ بِغَيْرِهِ, and بِهِ ↓ تبدّلهُ, He took the thing [as
a substitute, or in exchange, for another; or] in
the place of another. (S.) And استبدل ثَوْبًا مَكَانَ
ثَوْبٍ [He took a garment, or piece of cloth, in the
place, or in lieu, of a garment, &c.]; and أَخًا
مَكَانَ أَخٍ [a brother in the place, or in lieu, of a
brother]. (Lth, T.) It is said in the Kur [ii. 58],
أَتَسْتَبْدِلُونَ الَّذِى هُوَ أَدْنَى بِالَّذِى هُوَ خَيْرٌ Will ye
take in exchange that which is worse for that
which is better? (Jel. [See also other exs. in
the Kur ix. 39 and xlvii. last verse.]) And
الكُفْرَ بِالْإِيمَانِ ↓ مَنْ يَتَبَدَّلِ [Whoso adopteth infidelity in lieu of faith]. (Kur ii. 102. [See also
other exs. in the Kur iv. 2 and xxxiii. 52.]) ―
-b2-
See also 2, last sentence but one.
بِدْلٌ: see the next paragraph, in four places.
بَدَلٌ and ↓ بِدْلٌ, (Fr, T, S, M, Msb, K,) like
مَثَلٌ and مِثْلٌ, and شَبَهٌ and شِبْهٌ, (Fr, T, S,) and
نَكَلٌ and نِكَلٌ, the only other instances of the kind,
i. e. of words of both these measures, that have
been heard, accord. to AO, (S, TA, [but in one
copy of the S, I find A'Obeyd,]) and ↓ بَدِيلٌ (S,
M, Mgh, Msb, K,) all signify the same; (S, M,
Msb, K;) namely, A substitute; a thing given,
or received, or put, or done, instead of, in place
of, in lieu of, or in exchange for, another thing;
a compensation; syn. خَلَفٌ, (M, K,) and عِوَضٌ:
(Kull:) بَدَلُ الشَّىْءِ [and البَدَلُ مِنَ الشَّىْءِ] and
↓ بِدْلُهُ ↓ بَدِيلُهُ meaning الخَلَفُ مِنْهُ [the substitute for the thing; &c.]; (M, K;) i. e., another
thing: (S:) pl. أَبْدَالٌ, (IDrd, Msb, K,) which,
as pl. of ↓ بَدِيلٌ, has few parallels. (IDrd, TA.)
Sb says, [making a distinction between بَدَلٌ and
↓ بَدِيلٌ,] you say, إِنَّ بَدَلَكَ زَيْدٌ, i. e. Verily Zeyd
is in thy place: but if you put بَدَل in the place
of بَدِيلِ, you say, إِنَّ بَدَلَكَ زَيْدٌ, i. e. ↓ إِنَّ بِدَيلَكَ
زَيْدٌ [Verily thy substitute is Zeyd]: and a man
says to another, Go thou with such a one; and
he replies, مَعِىَ رَجُلٌ بَدَلُهُ, i. e. With me is a man
who stands in his stead, and is in his place, or
who will stand &c. (M.) You say also, بَلَ كَذَا
[and بَدَلًا مِنْ كَذَا], meaning Instead of, in
the place of, in lieu of, or in exchange for,
such a thing. (Kull.) [And بَدَلَ أَنْ تَفْعَلَ كَذَا
Instead of thy doing thus.] ―
-b2-  الأَبْدَالُ (IDrd, S,
M, K, &c.) and البُدَلَآءُ (TA) [The Substitutes, or
Lieutenants;] certain righteous persons, of whom
the world is never destitute; when one dies, God
substituting another in his place: (S:) certain
persons by means of whom God rules the earth;
(M, K;) consisting of seventy men, (IDrd, M,
K,) according to their assertion, of whom the
earth is never destitute; (IDrd, TA;) forty of
whom are in Syria, and thirty in the other
countries; (IDrd, M, K;) none of them dying
without another's supplying his place, (M, K,)
from the rest of mankind; (K;) and therefore
they are named ابدال: (M:) accord. to Abu-lBakà, as stated by El-Munáwee, it seems that
they meant [by this appellation] the substitutes
and successors of the prophets; and accord. to
some, they were seven, neither more nor fewer,
by means of whom God takes care of the seven
climates; one being successor of Abraham (ElKhaleel), and to him pertains the first climate;
the second, of Moses (El-Keleem); the third, of
Aaron; the fourth, of Idrees; the fifth, of
Joseph; the sixth, of Jesus; and the seventh, of
Adam: (TA: [in which is also mentioned a
treatise denying their existence, and disapproving
of the assertion that by means of them God takes
care of the earth:]) the sing. is بَدَلٌ and ↓ بِدْلٌ,
(T,) or ↓ بَدِيلٌ. (IDrd, S.) ―
-b3-  حُرُوفُ البَدَلِ (M,
K) The letters of substitution; those which are
substituted for other letters; not those which are
substituted in consequence of idghám. (M.) [The
letters included under this appellation differ accord.
to different authors: see De Sacy's Gram. Ar.
2nd ed. i. 33.] ―
-b4-  ↓ بِدْلٌ (Kr, M, K) and بَدَلٌ
(M, K,) applied to a man, also signify Generous,
and noble: (Kr, * M, K:) and used in these
senses, [says ISd,] they are, in my opinion, not
devoid of implication of the meaning of a substitute: (M:) the pl. is أَبْدَالٌ (M, K.)
بَدِيلٌ: see بَدَلٌ, in six places
بَدَّالٌ A seller of eatables (A Heyth, T, K) of
every kind: thus he is called by the Arabs;
(A Heyth, T;) because he changes one sale for
another; selling one thing to-day and another
to-morrow: (AHát, TA:) the vulgar say, بَقَّالٌ.
(A Heyth, T, K.) ―
-b2-  Also One who has no more
property than is sufficient for his purchasing one
thing, and who, when he sells this, buys another
thing in exchange for it. (TA in art. جدل.)
[Hence,] هٰذَا رَأْىُ الجَدَّالِينَ وَالبَدَّالِينَ is a phrase
used as meaning This is flimsy opinion. (TA
in the present art. and in art. جدل, [but in the
latter without the و,] on the authority of AHeyth.)
