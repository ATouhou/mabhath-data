بهت1
بُهِتَ, (S, Msb, K, &c.,) the most chaste form
of the verb in the sense here following, (S, TA,)
and that which most commonly obtains, and the
only form allowed by Th and IKt; (TA;) and
بَهِتَ, (S, L, Msb, K,) aor.
بَهَتَ; (Msb, K;) and
بَهُتَ, (S, L, Msb, K,) in which the dammeh is
said to give intensiveness to the signification, as
in قَضُوَ الرَّجُلُ, (TA,) aor.
بَهُتَ; (Msb, K;) and
بَهَتَ, aor.
بَهُتَ (K) and
بَهَتَ; (TA;) inf. n. بَهْتٌ;
(JK, K;) He was, or became, confounded, perplexed, or amazed, and unable to see his right
course; (JK, S, Msb, K;) not knowing what to
prefer nor what to postpone: (TA in art. اشر:)
he looked at a thing that he saw with a look of
wonder: (A, TA:) he was, or became, affected
with wonder: (JK:) he was, or became, cut
short, (انْقَطَعَ, K, TA,) and was silent, being confounded, or perplexed, and unable to see his
right course: (TA:) he (an adversary in a dispute or litigation) was overcome by an argument,
an allegation, or a plea. (L.) All these forms
occur in different readings of the saying in the
Kur [ii. 260], فَبُهِتَ الَّذِى كَفَرَ and فَبَهِتَ &c.,
(IJ, TA,) explained in the Wá'ee as meaning,
And he who disbelieved remained in confusion, or
perplexity, not seeing his right course, looking as
one in wonder: (Lb, TA:) but accord. to him
who reads فَبَهَتَ, the word الذى may hold the
place of a noun in the accus. case [as will
be seen from what follows]. (IJ, TA.)
-A2-  بَهَتَهُ,
aor.
بَهَتَ, (S, Msb,) inf. n. بَهْتٌ, (S, K,) He, or it,
caused him to become confounded, perplexed, or
amazed, not seeing his right course: (Zj, Msb:
[Golius, on the authority of Ibn-Maaroof, assigns
this meaning to ↓ بهّتهُ:]) or took him unawares,
or by surprise, or unexpectedly, or suddenly. (S,
K.) Zj cites as an ex. of the former meaning the
saying in the Kur [xxi. 41], تَأْتِيهِمْ بَغْتَةً فَتَبْهَتُهُمْ,
i. e., It shall come upon them suddenly, or unawares, and cause them to become confounded,
&c.: (TA: and so Bd and Jel explain it:) or,
and shall overcome them: (Bd:) J cites the same
as an ex. of the latter of the two meanings in the
preceding sentence; but his doing so requires
consideration; for the meaning which he gives
is taken from the word بغتة; not from البَهْتُ.
(MF, TA.) [But it is said also that] مُبَاهَتَةٌ [inf. n.
of ↓ باهتهُ] signifies The taking, or coming upon,
[one] unawares, by surprise, or unexpectedly.
(JK.) ―
-b2-  بَهَتَهُ, aor.
بَهَتَ, (S, A, K, &c.,) inf. n. بَهْتٌ
and بَهَتٌ and بُهْتَانٌ, (S, K,) or the last is a simple
subst., (Msb,) He calumniated him; slandered
him; accused him falsely; said against him that
which he had not done: (S, A, K:) [or he did
so in such a manner as to make one to be confounded, or perplexed, or amazed, at the falsity
of the charge, and not to see his right course:
(see بُهْتَانٌ, below:)] he lied against him; forged
a lie, or lies, against him; and i. q. قَابَلَهُ بِالكَذِبِ
[he accused him to his face falsely, or with falsehood]; (TA;) البَهْتُ signifies اِسْتِقْبَالُكَ أَخَاكَ بِمَا
لَيْسَ فِيهِ [thy accusing thy brother, or fellow, to
his face, of that which is not in him]: (JK:)
and بَهَتَهَا, aor.
بَهَتَ, inf. n. بَهْتٌ, he accused her
falsely of adultery; and forged a lie against her.
(Msb.) [See also اِغْتَابَهُ.] In the saying of Abu-n-Nejm,
سُبِّى الحَمَاةَ وَابْهَتِى عَلَيْهَا
[Revile thou the mother-in-law, and calumniate
her, or forge lies against her], على is [said by
J to be] redundant, or pleonastic; for one does
not say, بَعَتَ عَلَيْهِ, but only بَهَتَهُ. (S.) Upon
this, F says, in the K, that فَابْهَتِى عليها [thus in
the K] is a mistake; that J is in error, and that
the right reading is فَانْهَتِى عليها, with ن: but
this assertion made by F depends upon the authority of relaters of the verse in which the word in
question occurs. (MF.) IB says that ابهتى may
be here rendered trans. by means of على because
it is syn. with اِفْتَرِى, which is so rendered trans.,
in like manner as is done in other instances, of
which he gives an ex. from the Kur [xxiv. 63],
يُخَالِفُونَ عَنْ أَمْرِهِ, meaning يَخْرُجُونَ عن امره: he
adds that, accord. to J, عن in this ex. should
be considered redundant; but that عن and على
are not used redundantly like ب. (TA.) ―
-b3-
بَهَتَ الفَحْلَ عَنِ النَّاقَةِ He removed the stallion
from the she-camel in order that a stallion of
more generous race might cover her. (TA.)

باهتهُ, inf. n. مُبَاهَتَةٌ: see 1. ―
-b2-  [Also He
engaged with him in mutual calumny, slander, or
false accusation: a meaning indicated, but not
expressed, in the A.] You say, بَيْنَهُمَا مُبَاهَتَةٌ
[Between them two is mutual calumniation, &c.]:
and عَادَتُهُ أَنْ يُبَاحِثَ وَيُبَاهِتَ [His custom is to
engage with another in mutual scrutiny of secrets,
or faults, or the like, and in mutual calumniation,
&c.]: and وَلَا تَمَاقَتُوا ↓ لَا تَبَاهَتُوا [Calumniate ye
not one another, &c., nor hate ye one another on
account of any foul, or evil, affair]. (A.) ―
-b3-
And He confounded, perplexed, or amazed, him
(namely, his hearer,) by what he forged against
him. (TA.)

تَبَاْهَتَ see 3.
بَهْتٌ: see بُهْتَانٌ.
-A2-  A certain well-known kind
of stone. (K.)
بُهْتٌ: see بُهْتَانٌ, in two places.
-A2-  A certain
sidereal computation, or calculation; being [that
of] the direct course of stars in a day: [in Persian, a planet's motion in any given time: (Johnson's Pers. Arab. and Engl. Dict.:)] thought by
Az to be not Arabic. (TA.)
بُهْتَانٌ and ↓ بَهِيتَةٌ signify the same [when the
former is used as a subst.; i. e. A calumny, slander, or false accusation]: (S, A, Msb: [see 1:])
or both signify, the former as explained by Aboo-Is-hák, and the latter as explained in the K, a
falsehood by reason of which one is confounded,
or perplexed, and unable to see his right course;
(TA; [in which it seems to be indicated that
↓ بُهْتٌ signifies the same;]) from البَهْتُ as meaning
“ the being confounded ” &c.: (Aboo-Is-hák, TA:)
the former is a subst. signifying [also] a false
accusation of adultery against a woman; and a
forgery of a lie against her: (Msb:) and ↓ the
latter, [and the former also, simply,] a lying, or
lie, or falsehood; (K;) and so ↓ بُهْتٌ (K) and
↓ بَهْتٌ. (TA.) بُهْتَانًا وَإِثْمًا مُبِينًا, in the Kur iv. 24,
is said to mean Falsely accusing of adultery, and
acting in a manifestly sinful or criminal manner:
(Bd:) or it means acting wrongfully &c. (Bd,
Jel.) You say, ↓ رَمَاهُ بِالبَهِيتَةِ [He accused him with,
or of, calumny, &c.]. (A.) And ↓ يَا ِللْبَهِيتَةِ, with
kesr to the [prep.] ل, [i. e., O, come to my aid, or
succour, on account of the calumny! &c.; for it
is] a phrase used in calling for aid, or succour.
(S.) [And if you would express wonder, you say,
↓ يَا َللْبَهِيتَةِ, with fet-h to the prep. ل, i. e. O the
calumny! &c.]
بَهُوتٌ [A great, or frequent, calumniator, slanderer, or false-accuser; as also ↓ بَهَّاتٌ, mentioned
in the S only as an epithet applied to him who
calumniates, slanders, or accusely falsely;] an
intensive epithet from البَهْتُ; (IAth;) [i. e.] an
intensive form of the act. part. n. from البُهْتَان
[inf. n. of بَهَتَهُ]: (Mgh:) or i. q. ↓ مُبَاهِتٌ; (K;)
i. e., one who confounds, or perplexes, or amazes,
the hearer, by what he forges against him: (TA:)
and one who falsely accuses a woman of adultery,
and forges a lie against her: (Msb:) pl. بُهُتٌ
(IAth, Mgh, Msb, K) and بُهْتٌ, and, accord. to
the K, also بُهُوتٌ; but ISd and MF hold it to be
pl. of بَاهِتٌ, not of بَهُوتٌ; the former observing,
that a word of the measure فَاعِلٌ is one of those
which have a pl. of the measure فُعُولٌ, but not so
one of the measure فَعُولٌ; and that, as to the
saying of A'Obeyd, that عُذُوبٌ is pl. of عَذُوبٌ, it
is a mistake; for it is only pl. of عَاذِبٌ, and
the pl. of عَذُوبٌ is عُذُبٌ. (TA. [But see art.
عذب.])
بَهِيتٌ, see مَبْهُوتٌ, in two places.
بَهِيتَةٌ: see بُهْتَانٌ, in five places.
بَهَّاتٌ: see بَهُوتٌ:
-A2-  and see مَبْهُوتٌ.
بَاهِتٌ: see مَبْهُوتٌ, in two places.
-A2-  Also act.
part. n. [of بَهَتَهُ; signifying Causing to become
confounded, &c.: and calumniating, &c.:] from
البُهْتَانُ: (Mgh:) بُهُوتٌ, as mentioned above, is
held by ISd and MF to be a pl. of this word;
not of بَهُوتٌ, q. v. (TA.)
مَبْهُوتٌ Confounded, perplexed, or amazed, and
unable to see his right course: (S, K:) [other
(similar) meanings may be seen from explanations
of بُهِتَ:] accord. to Ks and the S and Sgh and
the K, one should not say ↓ بَاهِتٌ nor ↓ بَهِيتٌ; but
there is no reason in analogy why he who says
بَهَتَ, like نَصَرَ and مَنَعَ, should not say thus:
(TA:) Lb says, in the Expos. of the Fs, that
they said ↓ بَاهِتٌ and ↓ بَهَّاتٌ [which latter is an
intensive form] and ↓ بَهِيتٌ, which [last] may be
considered as having the meaning of the measure
مَفْعُولٌ, like مَبْهُوتٌ, or that of the measure فَاعِلٌ,
like بَاهِتٌ; but the former is the more agreeable
with analogy, and the more probable. (MF, TA)
―
-b2-  Also Calumniated, slandered, or falsely accused.
(S.)
مُبَاهِتٌ: see بَهُوتٌ.
