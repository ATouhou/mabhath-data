some copies of the K, بقبيس, (TA,) [The boxtree; Greek
πυξο�;] a certain kind of tree, resembling the آس [or myrtle] in leaves and berries: or
i. q. شَمْشَاد [a Persian word, also applied to the
box-tree]: (K:) it grows in the country of the
Greeks; and spoons and doors are made of it,
because of its hardness: and it may be with ش
[بَقْشٌ, which is explained by Sgh and in the K as
a kind of tree called in Persion خُوشْ سَاىْ; and
this, also, is a name of the box-tree]: (TA:) it
is astringent, having the property of drying up
the moisture of the intestines; and its saw-dust,
kneaded with honey, strengthens the hair, and
makes it abundant, and is good for (or prevents,
as in the CK,) the headache, and with the white
of the egg is good for what is termed وَثْىٌ, (K,)
i. e., a fracture [of the flesh]. (TA.)
