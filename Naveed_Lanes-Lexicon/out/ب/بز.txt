بَزُ3َ, (S, TA,) inf. n. بَزٌّ, (S, K, TA,)
He took it away; or seized it, or carried it
away, by force; (S, TA;) as also ↓ ابتزّهُ, (S, K,)
and ↓ بَزْبَزَهُ: (K:) he took it away unjustly, injuriously, and forcibly; as also ↓ ابتزّهُ: (K, * TA:)
he gained the mastery over it: (K, * TA:) he pulled
it up or out or off; removed it from its place;
displaced it; (K, * TA;) as also ↓ ابتزّهُ, and ↓ بَزْبَزَهُ.
(TA.) It is said in a prov., مَنْ عَزَّ بَزَّ He who
overcomes takes the spoil. (S, A.) And you say,
بَزَّهُ ثَوْبَهُ, and ↓ ابتزّهُ, He took away from him, or
seized or carried away from him by force, his
garment. (A.) It is said in a trad., ثِيَابِى ↓ فَيَبْتَزُّ
وَمَتَاعِى And he strips me, or despoils me, of my
clothes and my goods; takes them from me by
superior force. (TA.) You say also, بَزَّهُ ثِيَابَهُ
He pulled off from him his clothes. (TA.) And
الرَّجُلُ جَارِيَتَهُ مشنْ ثِيَابِهَا ↓ ابتزّ The man stripped
his slave-girl of her clothes. (Mgh, * TA.) ―
-b2-  Also
بَزَّثَوْبَهُ, aor. as above, He pulled his garment
towards him, or to him: so in a verse of Khálid
Ibn-Zuheyr El-Hudhalee [cited in art. ريب, but
with this difference, that يَجُرُّ is there put in the
place of يَبُزُّ]. (S, TA.) ―
-b3-  [بَزَّهُ is also explained
in the TA by حَبَسَهُ; but without any ex.; and I
think it probable that حَبَسَهُ is a mistake for جَذَبَهُ].

Mgh, K:) [see also بِزَّةٌ:] or a kind thereof: (Lth,
Mgh, Msb:) or such as are the goods of the بَزَّاز,

(K:) in the dial. of the people of El-Koofeh,
cloths, or stuffs, or garments, (ثياب,) of linen and
of cotton; not of wool nor of خَزّ: (Mgh:) pl.
بُزُوزٌ; (A;) meaning, in conjunction with خُزُوزٌ,
(i. e., خُزُوزٌ وَ بُزُوزٌ,) good cloths or stuffs or garments. (A.) [Golius explains it as “Chald.
בוּץ,
Byssus, seu potius pannus lineus, bombacinus,
etiam sericus:” as on the authority of the S and
K (though he omits the explanations in both
those lexicons) and Meyd and Ibn-Maaroof (who
explains it only by the Persian word جَامَهْ, meaning cotton or linen cloth, or a garment,) and the
Mirkát el-Loghah. He seems to have judged
from its resemblance in sound to the Chaldee and
Latin words with which he identifies it. The
things which it signifies, however, may perhaps
be so called because they are usual spoils: and
hence also, perhaps, the application here next
following.]

coats of mail and the مِغْفَر and the sword: (TA:)

accord. to AA, complete arms. (TA.) You say,
تَقَلَّدَ بَزَّا حَسَنًا He hung upon himself a goodly
sword, putting its suspensory belt or cord upon
his neck. (A.) And كَامِلَةٍ ↓ غَزَا فِى بِزَّةٍ He went

بِغَيْرِ حَقٍّ Then it shall be by spoliation, and the
taking of possessions without right: or, as some
relate this trad., ↓ بَزْبَزِيًّا; but accord. to Az, this
is naught. (TA.) You say also, رَجَعَتِ الخلَافَةُ
