not, in discourse, أَبْدَدْتُهُ as meaning فَرَّقْتُهُ: ” but

except by post-classical writers. (MF.) You say,
لَا بُدَّ مِنْ كَذَا (T, S, M, &c.) There is no separating oneself from such a thing: (AA, T, S, A,
K:) or there is no artifice whereby one may
avoid it, or escape from it: (M, K:) or there

stead. (TA.) And مَا لَكَ مِنْهُ بُدٌّ [Thou hast not
any means, or way, of separating thyself from

portion, separated, disunited, or dispersed: (Ham

indecl., with kesr for its termination because it
deviates from its original form, i. e., the inf. n.

original form and is of the fem. gender and has
the quality of an epithet; for two of these causes
render it imperfectly decl., and the three render
it indecl.; (S;) or بَدَادِ بَدَادِ, and بَدَادَ بَدَادَ, (Lh,
M, K,) the last indecl. with fet-h for its termination, (TA,) and ↓ بَدَدَ بَدَدَ, (Lh, M, K,) also

same manner as خَمْسَةَ عَشَرَ, (Lh, M, TA,) and
↓ بَدَدًا بَدَدًا; (Lh, M, K;) all of these indecl.

case as a denotative of state, except the last,

-b2-  يَا قَوْمِ
بَدَادِ بَدَادِ means O my people, take each one of
you his adversary, or opponent [with whom to
fight]. (As, T, S, K. *) Here بداد is indecl.,
with kesr for its termination, because it is an
imperative verbal noun, and the imperative is
alike uninfluenced with respect to its termination
by any governing word; and it is said to be with
kesr because two quiescent letters would otherwise occur together, [and] because it occupies the
place of an imperative verb [which in like manner
is terminated with kesr when it is necessary to
prevent the occurrence of two quiescent letters
together]. (S.) ―
-b3-  With the article, you say,
البَدَادُ, (As, T,) which signifies The going forth

بِدَادَانِ and ↓ بَدِيدَانِ are two bags (خَرِيطَتَانِ),
which are stuffed, and placed under the curved
pieces of wood, in order that the wood may not
gall the animal's back; derived from بَدَّ رِجْلَيْهِ
“ he parted his legs: ” (S:) [see also بَدِيدٌ:] or
the بِدَادَانِ of a قَتَب are two things like provender-bags, 'which are stuffed, and bound with
strings, or cords, to the pieces of wood called the
ظَلِفَات and أَحْنَآء: (T:) or they are, to the قَتَب,
like the كَرّ to the رَحْل, except that they do not
appear before the ظَلِفَة, being only within [it]:

بَادٌّ The inner side of the thigh: (M, A, K:) or
the part of the horseman's thigh that is next the
saddle: (T, M, A, L:) or the part between the
legs: (M, L:) the inner sides of the two thighs
are called the بَادَّانِ, (S,) because the saddle separates them; (IAar, M;) and if so, بَادٌّ is of the
measure فَاعِلٌ in the sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ;
or it may be a possessive epithet [meaning ذُو بَدٍّ].

apart: (M, L:) or having much flesh in the
thighs. (T, L.) الأَبَدٌّ is used to signify The weaver,

thighs. (M.) The following saying, (K,) quoted
by J, from the rájiz Aboo-Nukheyleh Es-Saadee,
أَلَدُّ يَمْشِى مِشَيَةَ الأَبَدِّ
is incorrect, and should be thus,
بَدَّآءُ تَمْشِى مِشْيَةَ الأَبَدِّ
[A woman of large make, walking in the manner
of the man of large make; or a woman wide
between the thighs, &c.]; (K;) for it is descriptive

↓ يَبَادِيدُ, (K,) [but see what follows; like أَنَادِيدُ
and يَنَادِيدُ;] Birds in a state of dispersion. (S,
K.) In the following verse of 'Otárid Ibn-Kurrán,
quoted by J,
كَأَنَّمَا أَهُلُ حَجْرٍ يَنْظُرُونَ مَتَى
يَرَوْنَنِى خَارِجًا طَيْرٌ يَبَادِيدُ
[As though the people of Hajr, watching when
they should see me going forth, were birds in a
state of dispersion], (K,) thus related also by
Yaakoob, and thus in the handwriting of Az,
(TA,) the last two words should be طَيْرُ اليَنَادِيدِ,
the latter with ن, and governed by the former in
the gen. case, the rhyme being with kesr: (K:)
so says Aboo-Sahl El-Harawee. (TA.) ―

أَمُبِدٌّ سُؤَالَكَ العَالَمِينَ

among mankind one by one, so as to include them
universally? or dost thou constrain them by thy
petition? from the saying, مَا لَكَ مِنْهُ بُدٌّ [“ thou
hast no means,” or “ way,” “ of separating thyself
from it,” or “ avoiding it ”]. (M, L.)
