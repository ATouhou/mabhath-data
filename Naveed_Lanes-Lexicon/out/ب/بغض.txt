بغّضهُ اللّٰهُ إِلَى النَّاسِ, (S, TA,) or لِلنَّاسِ, (Msb,)
[but this I think doubtful, from what is said in
explanation of the verb of wonder, (see 4,)] inf. n.
تَبْغِيضٌ, (S, K,) God rendered him hateful, odious,
or an object of hatred, to men; (S, Msb; *)
تَبْغِيضٌ being the contr. of تَحْبِيبٌ: (K:) or
very hateful or odious. (TA.) You say also,
حُبِّبَ إِلَىَّ زَيْدٌ وَ بُغِّضَ إِلَىَّ عَمْرٌو [Zeyd was rendered an object of love to me, and 'Amr was
rendered an object of hatred, or of much hatred,
to me]. (A, TA.)
3
بَاغَضْتُهُ, inf. n. مُبَاغَضَةٌ, I rendered him
[hatred, or] vehement hatred, reciprocally. (A, *
TA.) You say also, بَيْنَهُمَا مُبَاغَضَةٌ [Between them
two is reciprocal hatred, or vehement hatred].
(A.)
4
ابغضهُ, (S, A, Msb, K,) inf. n. إِبْغَاضٌ, (Msb,)
He hated him. (S, A, * Msb, * K.) It is said that
↓ بَغَضَهُ is not allowable: (Msb:) or يَبْغُضُنِى is a
bad form; (AHát, K;) used by the lower class;
and sanctioned by Th only; for he explains قَالِينَ,
as occurring in the Kur [xxvi. 168], by بَاغِضِينَ,
which shows that he held بَغَضَ to be a dial. var.;
for otherwise he would have said مُبْغِضِينَ: (AHát:)
but the epithet بَغُوضٌ affords a strong evidence in
favour of the opinion of Th here mentioned; for
فَعُولٌ is mostly from فَاعِلٌ, not from مُفْعِلٌ. (TA.)
-A2-  مَا أَبْغَضَهُ إِلَىَّ, (S,) or لِى, (K,) is [said to be]
anomalous; (S, K;) because the verb of wonder
is not regularly formed from a verb of the measure
أَفْعَلَ; but this is not anomalous; for it is from
بَغَضَ فُلَانٌ إِلَىَّ [“ such a one was, or became,
hateful, or odious, to me: ” ما ابغضه الىّ signifying How hateful, or odious, is he to me! but
ما ابغضه لِى, How he hates me! for] the lexicologists and grammarians relate that مَا أَبْغَضَنِى لَهُ
is said when thou hatest him; and ما ابغضنى إِلَيْهِ,
when he hates thee: (IB:) ISd says, on the
authority of Sb, that ما ابغضنى له means that
thou art an object of hatred (مُبْغَضٌ [so in the
TA, but this is evidently a mistake for مُبْغِضٌ, a
hater,]) to him; and ما ابغضه الىّ, that he is an
object of hatred with thee, or in thine estimation.
(TA.)
-A3-  أَنْعَمَ اللّٰهُ بِكَ عَيْنًا وَ أَبْغَضَ بِعَدُوِّكَ عَيْنًا, (so
in the A, and the latter verb thus in the JK and
in the L,) or the former verb is نَعِمَ, (L, K,) and
the latter ↓ بَغَضَ, (K, TA,) like نَصَرَ, (TA,) or
↓ بَغِضَ, (CK,) is a form of imprecation (TA)
(tropical:)  [app. meaning May God make thine eye to be
refreshed by the sight of him whom thou lovest,
and make the eye of thine enemy to be pained by
the sight of him whom he hateth: or may God
make an eye to be refreshed by the sight of thee,
and make an eye to be affected with hatred by
the sight of thine enemy].
5
تبغّض He manifested, or showed, hatred;
or he became, or made himself, an object of

لِى فُلَانٌ وَ تَبَغَّضَ لِى أَخُوهُ [Such a one manifested
love to me, or made himself an object of love to
me, and his brother manifested hatred to me,
or made himself an object of hatred to me]. (A,
TA.)
6
تباغض القَوْمُ The company of men hated one
another: (Msb:) تَبَاغُضٌ is the contr. of تَحَابُبٌ.
(S, K.) You say, مَا رَأَيْتُ أَشَدَّ تَبَاغُضًا مِنْهُمَا [I
have not seen any more vehement in mutual hatred
than they two]. (A, TA.)
