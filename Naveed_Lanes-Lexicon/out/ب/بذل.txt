portion of his run, and is unsparing with a portion thereof; not putting forth the whole at once:

فُلَانًا شَيْئًا I asked of such a one that he would

بَذْلٌ A thing that is given liberally, freely, or
willingly: and inf. n. [or 1, q. v.], used as a proper
subst.: pl. بُذُولٌ. (Har p. 206.)
بَذْلَةٌ: see what next follows, in two places.
بِذْلَةٌ A garment that is worn (T, S, Msb) in
service, or work; (S, Msb;) that is not preserved,
laid up, taken care of, or reserved; (T, M, K;)
as also ↓ بَذْلَةٌ (Msb) and ↓ مبْذَلٌ, (T,) or ↓ مِبْذَلَةٌ,
(S, M, K,) the pl. of which is مَبَاذِلٌ: (S:) and
an old and worn-out garment; (TA;) as also
↓ مِبْذَلٌ and ↓ مِبْذَلَةٌ; (M, K;) the last of which
is mentioned on the authority of AZ, but is disapproved by 'Alee Ibn-Hamzeh, who asserts it
to be without ة: (IB, TA:) بِذْلَةٌ sometimes has
بِذَلٌ as pl. (TA.) You say, ↓ جَآءَ نَا فُلَانٌ فِى مَبَاذِلِه,
i. e. فِى ثِيَابِ بِذْلَتِهِ or ↓ بَذْلَتِهِ [Such a one came
to us in his garments that he wore in service, or
work]. (S, accord. to different copies. [I have
shown that بِذْلَةٌ and بَذْلَةٌ are dial. vars., both as
inf. ns. (see 8) and as proper substs.]) The word
بَدْلَةٌ, with fet-h, and with the unpointed د, applied
by the vulgar to [a suit of] new clothes, is a mistake for بِذْلَةٌ, and this is correctly a name for old
and worn-out clothes. (TA. [But this is doubtful;
for بَدْلَةٌ commonly signifies, in modern Arabic, a
change of clothes; and hence, a suit of clothes,
whether new or old.]) ―
-b2-  IJ uses it metaphorically,
in relation to poetry; saying, الرَّجَزُ إِنَّمَا يُسْتَعَانُ
بِهِ فِى البِذْلَةِ وَ عِنْدَ الاِعْتِمَالِ وَ الحُدَآءِ وَ المِهْنَةِ (tropical:)  [The
metre termed rejez is only used as an aid in the
ordinary, or meaner, business of life, and on the
occasion of doing one's work, and singing to
camels for the purpose of urging them on, and
performing service of any kind: but in this case
it may be regarded as an inf. n.: see 8]. (M.)
بَذُولٌ: see بَذَّالٌ.
بَذَالَةٌ i. q. بَذْلٌ [inf. n. of 1, The act of giving
liberally, &c.]. (TA.)

freely, or willingly; or who so gives it much, or
frequently; as also ↓ بَذُولٌ (T, TA) [and app.
↓ مِبْذَالٌ, (like مِسْمَاحٌ &c.,) of which the pl.
occurs in the following saying]. ↓ هُمْ مَبَاذِيلُ
لِلْمَعْرُوفِ [They are very liberally disposed to the
exercise of beneficence, or bounty]. (TA.)
بَاذِلٌ Any one who gives [liberally,] freely, or
willingly. (M.)

places.

مُبْتَذَلٌ Held in mean estimation: as in the
saying, مَالُهُ مَصُونٌ وَ عِرْضُهُ مُبْتَذَلٌ [His wealth
is preserved, or taken care of, and his honour,
or reputation, is held in mean estimation]. (TA.)
―
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  Language, and a proverb, which one is wont
to speak or mention, or which one is fond of
speaking or mentioning. (TA.) ―

TA.)
مُبْتَذِلٌ, (K,) or ↓ مُتَبَذِّلٌ, (M, [so in a copy
of that work, accord. to the TT, but this is probably a mistranscription,]) Wearing a مِبْذَل, i. e.
[a garment used in service or work, or] an old
and worn-out garment: (M, K:) and the latter,
[if not a mistranscription for the former,] neglecting the adorning of himself, by way of humility.
