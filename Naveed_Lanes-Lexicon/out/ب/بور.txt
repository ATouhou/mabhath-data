T, S, A, Mgh) was, or became, unsaleable, or difficult of sale, or in little demand: (T, S, A, Mgh,

(T, S, A,) inf. n. بَوْرٌ, (S,) He brought the she-camel to the stallion to see if she were pregnant
or not: (T, S, A, K:) for if she is pregnant,

with an explanation given above]): (S, TA:) or
↓ ابتيارا, which is without ء, here signifies by
asserting with truth my having had sexual intercourse with her: (TA:) [for] ابتارها signifies he
asserted with truth that he had had sexual intercourse with her; and ابتهرها “ he asserted the
same falsely: ” (A 'Obeyd, T:) and the former
signifies also he had sexual intercourse with her
(K, TA) by force; he ravished her: (TA:) or
ابتار signifies he charged, or upbraided, a person
with that which was not in him; and ابتهر “ he
charged, or upbraided, with that which was in
him. ” (TA in art. بهر.)
