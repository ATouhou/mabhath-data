برطلQ. 1
بَرْطَلَ, (inf. n. بَرْطَلَةٌ, TK,) He placed a
long stone (بِرْطِيلٌ) in the fore part (إِزَآء, q. v.,)
of his watering-trough. (Lth, K.)
-A2-  [He gave
him a بِرْطِيل, or bribe;] he bribed him. (K.)
And بُرْطِلَ He was bribed. (TA.)
Q. 2
تَبَرْطَلَ He received a [بِرْطِيل, or] bribe.
(K.)
بِرْطِيلٌ A long stone: pl. بَرَاطِيلٌ: (S:) or a
broad stone: (TA in art. برم:) or a stone (Seer,
A, K) of an oblong form (A, TA) a cubit in
length, (Seer, TA,) or an iron, long, broad, and
hard by nature, (K,) not such as is made long, or
sharpened or made sharp-pointed, by men, (TA,)
with which the millstone is pecked (تُنْقَرُ [i. e.,
wrought into shape, and roughened in its surface,
by pecking]): so says Lth: (TA:) to this is
sometimes likened the muzzle, or fore part of the
nose and mouth, of a she-camel of high breed:
(Lth, TA:) [and hence,] it signifies also (assumed tropical:)  the
muzzle, or fore part of the nose and mouth, of an
old bear: (TA:) some say that the dual signifies
two elongated stones, of the hardest kind, slender,
and sharp-pointed, with which the millstone is
pecked (تُنْقَرُ [explained above]). (TA.) Also,
(K,) accord. to Sh, (TA,) A pickaxe, or stonecutter's pick; syn. مِعْوَلٌ: (Sh, Msb, K:) pl. as
above: accord. to IAar, what is called in Persian
اسكنه [app. a mistranscription, or a dial. var., of
إِسْكَنك]. (TA.)
-A2-  A bribe; syn. رِشْوَةٌ: (Msb,
K:) app. mentioned in the K as an Arabic word;
and if so, the pronunciation with fet-h to the ب
is a vulgarism, since there is no such measure as
فَعْلِيلٌ: Abu-l-'Alà El-Ma'arree says that it is not
known in this sense in the [classical] language of
the Arabs; and it seems as though it were taken
from the same word signifying “an oblong stone;”
as though the bribe were likened to a stone that
is thrown: (TA:) or it seems as though it were
taken from the same word signifying a مِعْوَل;
because therewith a thing is got out; (Msb;) and
so El-Munáwee asserts it to be: (TA:) pl. as
above. (Msb, K.) Hence the phrase, أَلْقَمَهُ البِرْطِيلَ
[He tipt him the bribe; conveyed it to him in like
manner as one puts a morsel into another's mouth;
somewhat like our phrase he greased his fist].
(TA.) And the saying, البَرَاطِيلُ تَنْصُرُ الأَبَاطِيلِ
[Bribes render victorious false allegations]: (Msb,
TA:) a prov. (Msb.)
مُبَرْطِلُ الرَّأْسِ A man having a long head. (A
in art. كوز.)
