thus related by some, instead of لِيَنْبَاعَ, means
Silent in order to bring about, or effect, a بَائِقَة,
i. e., a calamity, or misfortune: (K in art. بوع,
q. v.:) or, to launch forth, and manifest what is

-A2-  See also the next paragraph.
بُوقٌ [A trumpet;] a certain thing in which one
blows; (IDrd, S, Mgh, K;) in which one blows
as in a musical pipe: (Kr, K:) [mostly used in
war, but] mentioned by a poet, cited by As, as
used by the Christians: (S:) IDrd says, The
Arabs used this word, but I know not its origin:
Esh-Shiháb says, in the 'Ináyeh, that it is arabicized, from [the Persian] بُورِى: (TA: [but this
is obviously improbable:]) pl. بُوقَاتٌ (Mgh, Msb)
and بِيقَانٌ (Msb [in my copy of the Mgh, erroneously, بِيَقَاتٌ]) [and أَبْوَاقٌ, a pl. of pauc., commonly used in the present day]. نَفَخَ فِى البُوقِ
[He blew the trumpet, lit., in the trumpet,] means
[also] (tropical:)  he spoke that in which was no profit.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] (assumed tropical:)  One who does not conceal a
secret; (Lth, JK, K;) as also ↓ بَوْقٌ. (K.) ―
-b3-
Also A certain thing in which the miller blows;
(JK, K;) accord. to the copies of the K, resembling a مِنْقَاب; but this is a mistake: (TA:) it
is a thing resembling a [shell of the kind called]
مِنْقَاب, the hole of which is twisted; and sometimes the miller blows in it, raising his voice; and
what he means thereby is known. (Lth, TA.)
-A2-
See also بَوْقٌ.
بَاقَةٌ A bundle of herbs, or leguminous plants.
(S, K.) [And in modern Arabic, A bunch of
flowers.]
بُوقَةٌ A shower, fall, or storm, of rain, (JK, S,)
that has burst forth with a dash: (S, TA:) or
such as is vehement; or disapproved, disliked, or
deemed evil: (K:) pl. بُوَقٌ. (JK, K.)
بَؤُوقٌ, or دَاهِيَةٌ بَؤُوقٌ, A vehement calamity or
misfortune or disaster. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And the former,
applied to a man, Thievish; a great thief. (JK.)
بَائِقَةٌ A calamity, misfortune, or disaster; (JK,
S, Msb, K;) a vehement evil or mischief; (Msb;)
a trail that befalls a people: (TA:) pl. بَوَائِقٌ.
(S, Msb, K.) It is said in a trad., لَا يَدْخُلُ الجَنَّةَ
مَنْ لَا يَأْمَنُ جَارَهُ بَوَائِقَهُ, meaning, accord. to
Katádeh, [He will not enter Paradise whose
neighbour is not secure from] his wrongful, or
injurious, conduct: or, accord. to Ks, his malevolent, or mischievous, dispositions, and his evil
conduct. (S.)
IF says, in the “ Makáyees,” that بوق is not
an accredited root, and that there is not, in his
opinion, any correct word belonging to it. (TA.)
[But this is a strange assertion.]
