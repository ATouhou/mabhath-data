بيض1
بَاضَهُ, (S, K,) first pers. بِضْتُ, (M,) aor.
يَبِيضُ, for which one should not say يَبُوضُ, [though
it would be agreeable with a general rule respecting verbs denoting surpassingness,] (S, O,) He
surpassed him in whiteness. (S, M, O, K.)
-A2-
بَاضَتْ, (S, M, Msb, K, except that in the M and
Msb we find the masc. form, بَاضَ, followed by
الطَّائِرُ,) aor. تَبِيضُ, (Msb,) inf. n. بَيْضٌ, (M,
Msb,) said of an ostrich, (M,) or a hen, (K,) or
any bird, (S, M, Msb,) and the like, (Msb,) She
laid her eggs, (M, Msb, TA,) or egg. (Msb.) ―
-b2-
بَاضَ السَّحَابُ (tropical:)  The clouds rained. (IAar, O, K.)
A poet says, [using a phrase from which this
application of the verb probably originated,]
بَاضَ النَّعَامُ بِهِ فَنَفَّرَ أَهْلَهُ
إِلَّا المُقِيمَ عَلَى الدَّوَى المُتَأَفِّنِ
(IAar,) i. e. (tropical:)  The نعام, meaning the نَعَائِم, [or
Twentieth Mansion of the Moon,] sent down rain
upon it, and so put to flight its occupants, except
him who remained incurring the risk of dying
from disease, wasting away: [the last word being
in the gen. case, by poetic license, because the
next before it is in that case; like خَرِبٍ in the
phrase هٰذَا جُحْرُ ضَبٍّ خَرِبٍ:] the poet is describing a valley rained upon and in consequence producing herbage; for the rain of the asterism
called النعائم is in the hot season, [when that
asterism sets aurorally, (see مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ, in art.
نزل,)] whereupon there grows, at the roots of
the حَلِىّ, a plant called نَشْر, which is poisonous,
killing beasts that eat of it: the verse is explained
as above by El-Mohellebee: (IB:) or, as IAar
says, the poet means rain that falls at the نَوْء [by
which we are here to understand the setting
aurorally] of النعائم; and that when this rain falls,
the wise flees and the stupid remains. (O.) ―
-b3-
بَاضَ بِالمَكَانِ (tropical:)  He remained, stayed, or abode, in
the place [like as a bird does in the place where
she lays her eggs]. (O, K.) ―
-b4-  بَاضَتِ الأَرْضُ
(assumed tropical:)  The earth produced كَمْأَة [or truffles, which
are thus likened to eggs]: (A, TA:) or (assumed tropical:)  the
earth produced the plants that it contained: or
(assumed tropical:)  it became changed in its greenness to yellowness,
and scattered the fruit, or produce, and dried up.
(M, TA.) ―
-b5-  بَاضَ الحَرُّ (tropical:)  The heat became vehement, or intense. (S, A, K.)
-A3-  بَاضَ القَوْمَ; &c.:
see 8, in three places.

بيّض, (S, M, K,) inf. n. تَبْيِضٌ, (S,) He
whitened a thing; made it white; (S, M;) contr.
of سَوَّدَ. (K.) He bleached clothes. (M.) [He
whitewashed a wall &c. He tinned a copper
vessel or the like.] You say, بَيَّضَ اللّٰهُ وَجْهَهُ [lit.,
God whitened his face: or may God whiten his
face: meaning (tropical:)  God rendered his face expressive of joy, or cheerfulness; or rejoiced, or cheered,
him: or may God &c.: and also God cleared
his character; or manifested his honesty, or the
like: or may God &c.: see the contr. سَوَّدَ].
(TA.) And بيّض لَهُ [He left a blank space for it;
namely, a word or sentence or the like: probably
post-classical]. (TA in art. شمس; &c.) ―
-b2-  [He
wrote out fairly, after having made a first rough
draught: in this sense, also, opposed to سَوَّدَ: probably post-classical.] ―
-b3-  (tropical:)  He filled a vessel: (M,
A, K: *) or he filled a vessel, and a skin, with
water and milk. (S, O.) ―
-b4-  And (tropical:)  He emptied
(A, K) a vessel: (A:) thus it bears two contr.
significations. (K.)
3
بايضهُ, (S, M,) inf. n. مُبَايَضَةٌ, (TA,) He
contended with him for superiority in whiteness.
(S, M.) ―
-b2-  بَايَضَنِى فُلَانٌ (tropical:)  Such a one acted openly
with me; syn. جَاهَرَنِى: from النَّهَارِ ↓ بَيَاضُ [the
whiteness of day, or daylight]. (A, TA.)
4
أَبْيَضَتْ and
أَبَاضَتْ She (a woman) brought
forth white children: and in like manner one
says of a man [أَبْيَضَ and أَبَاضَ, meaning He
begat white children]. (M, TA.) ―

بَيْضَة [or helmet] (S, K, TA) of iron. (TA.)
-A2-
ابتاضهُمْ He entered into their بَيْضَة [or territory,
&c.]: (A, TA:) and ابتاضوا القَوْمَ They exterminated the people, or company of men; they
extirpated them; (M, K; *) as also ↓ بَاضُوهُمْ:
(M:) and اُبْتِيضُوا [originally اُبْتُيِضُوا; in the CK,
incorrectly, ابتَيَضُوا;] They were exterminated,
or extirpated, (K, TA,) and their بَيْضَة [or
quarter, &c.,] was given up to be plundered:
(TA:) and اِبْتَضْنَاهُمْ We smote their بيضة [or
collective body, &c.,] and took all that belonged
to them by force; as also ↓ بِضْنَاهُمْ: and ↓ بِيضَ
الحَىُّ The tribe was so smitten &c. (TA.)

ابيضّ, (S, M, Msb, K,) and, by poetic
license, اِبْيَضَضَّ, [of which see an ex. voce خَفَضَ,
and see also 9 in art. حو,] (M, TA,) inf. n.
اِبْيِضَاضٌ, (S, Msb,) It was, or became, white;
(S, M, Msb;) contr. of اِسْوَدَّ; (K;) as also
↓ ابياضّ, inf. n. اِبْيِيضَاضٌ;. (S;) contr. of اِسْوَادَّ;
(K;) and ↓ أَبَاضَ: which ↓ last also signifies it
(herbage or pasture) became white, and dried up.
(M, TA.) [You say also, ابيضّ وَجْهُهُ, lit., His
face became white: meaning (tropical:)  his face became
expressive of joy, or cheerfulness; or he became
joyful, or cheerful: and also his character became
cleared; or his honesty, or the like, became manifested: see 2.]

إِبْيَاْضَّ see 9.
بَيْضٌ: see بَيْضَةٌ, in three places.
بَيْضَةٌ An egg (Msb) of an ostrich, (Mgh,) and
of any bird, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) and the like, i. e.
of anything that is termed صَمُوخٌ [or having
merely an ear-hole] as distinguished from such as
is termed أَذُونٌ [or having an ear that is called
أُذُنٌ]: so called because of its whiteness: (TA:)
n. un. of ↓ بَيْضٌ: (S, M, * Msb, K:) pl. [of the
former] بَيْضَاتٌ (M, Sgh, K) and بَيَضَاتٌ, which
latter is irreg., (M, Sgh,) and only used by poetic
license; (Sgh;) and (of بَيْضٌ, M) بُيُوضٌ. (M,
K.) You say, أَفْرَخَتِ البَيْضَةُ The egg had in it
a young bird. (ISh.) And أَفْرَخَ بَيْضَةُ القَوْمِ
(assumed tropical:)  What was hidden, of the affair, or case, of the
people, or company of men, became apparent.
(ISh.) [See also art. فرخ.] بَيْضَةُ البَلَدِ signifies

And hence the saying, هُوَ أَذَلُّ مِنْ بَيْضَةِ البَلَدِ
(tropical:)  He is more abject, or vile, than the egg of the
ostrich which it abandons (S, A, * K) in the desert.
(TA.) You say also, هُوَ بَيْضَةُ البَلَدِ in dispraise
and in praise. (IAar, Aboo-Bekr, M.) When
said in dispraise, it means (tropical:)  He is like the egg of
the ostrich from which the young bird has come
forth, and which the male ostrich has cast away,
so that men and camels tread upon it: (IAar,
M:) or he is alone, without any to aid him;
like the egg from which the male ostrich has
arisen, and which he has abandoned as useless:
(TA:) or he is an obscure man, or one of no
reputation, whose lineage is unknown. (Ham
p. 250.) And when said in praise, it means (tropical:)  He
is like the ostrich's egg in which is the young
bird; because the male ostrich in that case protects it: (IAar, M:) or he is unequalled in
nobility; like the egg that is left alone: (M:)
or he is a lord, or chief: (IAar, M:) or he is the
unequalled of the بَلَد [or country or the like],
to whom others resort, and whose words they
accept: (K:) or he is a celebrated, or wellknown, person. (Ham p. 250.) [See also art.
بلد. And for another meaning of بَيْضَةُ البَلَدِ see
below.] ―
-b2-  (tropical:)  A helmet of iron, (AO, S, * M, * Mgh, *
K, *) which is composed of plates like the bones
of the skull, the edges whereof are joined together
by nails; and sometimes of one piece: (AO:) so
called because resembling in shape the egg of an
ostrich: (AO, M, Mgh: *) in this sense, also,
n. un. of ↓ بَيْضٌ. (S, K: [in the CK, for والحَدِيدُ
we should read والحَدِيدِ.]) This may be meant
in a trad. in which it is said that a man's hand
is to be cut off for his stealing a بَيْضَة. (Mgh.)
―
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  A testicle: (S, K:) pl. بِيضَانٌ. (TA.) ―
-b4-
(tropical:)  The bulb of the saffron-plant [&c.]: as resembling an egg in shape. (Mgh.) ―
-b5-  (assumed tropical:)  [A tuber:
for the same reason.] ―
-b6-  (assumed tropical:)  A kind of grape of
Et-Táïf, white and large. (M.) ―
-b7-  (tropical:)  The core
of a boil: as resembling an egg. (M.) ―
-b8-  (tropical:)  The
fat of a camel's hump: for the same reason.
(M.) ―
-b9-  بَيْضَةُ البَلَدِ, in addition to its meanings
mentioned above, also signifies (assumed tropical:)  The white truffle:
(O, K:) or simply truffles; syn. الكَمْأَةُ; (TA;)
or these are called الأَرْضِ ↓ بَيْضُ. (A.) ―
-b10-  بَيْضَةٌ
also signifies (tropical:)  The continent, or container, or
receptacle, (حَوْزَة,) of anything. (S, K, TA.) And
[hence] بَيْضَةُ الإِسْلَامِ (tropical:)  The place [or territory]
which comprises El-Islám [meaning the Muslims];
like as the egg comprises the young bird: (Mgh:)
or this signifies the congregation, or collective
body, of the Muslims. (AZ, M.) And بَيْضَةُ القَوْمِ
(tropical:)  The quarter, tract, region, or district, of the
people, or company of men: (S, K:) the heart;
or midst, or main part, of the abode thereof:
(S, TA:) the principal place of abode (أَصْل)
thereof; (M, TA;) the place that comprises them;
the place of their government, or regal dominion;
and the seat of their دعوة [i. e. دِعْوَة or kindred and
brotherhood]: (TA:) the midst of them: (M:)
or, as some say, their [kinsfolk such as are termed]
عَشِيرَة: (TA:) but when you say, أَتَاهُمُ العَدُوُّ فِى
بَيْضَتِهِمْ, the meaning is [the enemy came to them
in] their principal place of abode (أَصْل), and the
place where they were congregated. (TA.) And
بَيْضَةُ الدَّارِ (tropical:)  The midst of the country or place of
abode or the like: (AZ, M, TA:) the main part
thereof. (TA.) And بَيْضَةُ المُلْكِ i. q. حَوْزَتُهُ
(assumed tropical:)  [The seat of regal power: or the heart, or
principal part, of the kingdom]. (S and K in
art. حوز.) ―
-b11-  بَيْضَةُ الخِدْرِ (M, A, K) (tropical:)  The damsel
(M, K) of the خدر [or curtain &c.]: (K: [in
the CK, جَارِيَتُهَا is erroneously put for جَارِيَتُهُ:])
because she is kept concealed within it. (TA.)
You say also, هِىَ مِنْ بَيْضَاتِ الحِجَالِ (tropical:)  [She is
of the damsels of the curtained bridal canopies].
(A, TA.) بَيْضَةٌ is used by a metonymy to signify
(tropical:)  A woman, by way of likening her thereto [i. e.
to an egg] in colour, and in respect of her being
protected as beneath the wing. (B.) [See Kur
xxxvii. 47.] ―
-b12-  بَيْضَةٌ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  White land,
in which is no herbage; opposed to سَوْدَةٌ: (TA:)
and ↓ بِيضَةٌ, with kesr, white, smooth land; (K;)
thus accord. to IAar, with kesr to the ب: (Sh:)
and ↓ أَرْضٌ بَيْضَآءُ signifies smooth land, in which is
no herbage; as though herbage blackened land:
or untrodden land: as also بَيْضَةٌ. (M.) ―
-b13-  بَيْضَةُ
النَّهَارِ The whiteness of day; [daylight;] i. q.
↓ بَيَاضُهُ; (K;) i. e. its light. (Har p. 222.) You
say, أَتَيْتُهُ فِى بَيْضَةِ النَّهَارِ I came to him in the
whiteness of day. (TA.) ―
-b14-  بَيْضَةُ الحِرِّ (assumed tropical:)  The vehemence, or intenseness, of heat. (M.) And بَيْضَةُ
القَيْظِ (tropical:)  The most vehement, or intense, heat of
summer, or of the hottest period of summer, from

[i. e., reckoning for the commencement of the
era of the Flight, in central Arabia, from about
the 26th of May to about the 4th of August,
O. S.;] (A, * TA;) as also القَيْظِ ↓ بَيْضَآءُ. (A,
TA.) And بَيْضَةُ الصَّيْفِ (assumed tropical:)  The main part of the
صيف [or summer]: (M, TA:) or the vehement,
or intense, heat thereof. (Ham p. 250.)
بَيضَةٌ: see بَيْضَةٌ, in the latter part of the paragraph.
بَيَاضٌ Whiteness; contr. of سَوَادٌ; in an animal,
and in a plant, and in other things; and, accord.
to IAar, in water also; (M;) the colour of that
which is termed أَبْيَضُ: (S, Msb, * K:) they said
بَيَاضٌ and ↓ بَيَاضَةٌ, (S, M, K,) like as they said
مَنْزِلٌ and مَنْزِلَةٌ: (S:) بَيَاضَةٌ being applied to a
whiteness in the eye. (M.) You say, هٰذَا أَشَدُّ
بَيَاضًا مِنْ كَذَا [This is whiter than such a thing]:
(S, K: *) but not ↓ أَبْيَضُ منْهُ: (S:) the latter is
anomalous; (K;) [like أَسْوَدُ مِنْهُ; q. v.;] but it
was said by the people of El-Koofeh, (S, K,) who
adduced as authority the saying of the rájiz,
جَارِيَةٌ فِى دِرْعِهَا الفَضْفَاضِ
أَبْيَضُ مِنْ أُخْتِ بَنِى إِبَاضِ
[A damsel in her ample shift, whiter than the
sister of the tribe of Benoo-Ibád]: Mbr, however, says that an anomalous verse is no evidence
against a rule commonly approved: and as to the
saying of another,
إِذَا الرِّجَالُ شَتَوْا وَاشْتَدَّ أَكْلُهُمُ
فَأَنْتَ أَبْيَضُهُمْ سِرْبَالَ طَبَّاخِ
[When men experience dearth in winter, and their
eating becomes vehement, thou art the whitest of
them, or rather the white of them, in respect of
cook's clothing, having little or nothing to do with
entertaining them], the word in question may be
considered as an epithet of the measure أَفْعَلُ that is
followed by مِنْ to denote excess: but it is only
like the instances in the sayings هُوَ أَحْسَنُهُمْ وَجْهًا
and أَكْرَمُهُمْ أَبًا, meaning حَسَنُهُمْ وَجْهًا and كَرِيِمُهُمْ
أَبًا; so it is as though he said فَأَنْتَ مُبْيَضُّهُمْ سِرْبَالًا;
and as he has prefixed it to a complement which
it governs in the gen. case, what follows is in the
accus. case as a specificative. (S.) This latter
verse is by Tarafeh, who satirizes therein 'Amr
Ibn-Hind; and is also differently related in respect
of the first hemistich, and the first word of the
second. (L, TA.) ―
-b2-  بَيَاضُ النَّهَارِ: see 3; and see
بَيْضَةٌ, near the end of the paragraph. ―
-b3-  بَيَاضٌ is
also used elliptically for ذُو بَيَاضٍ; and thus means
(assumed tropical:)  White clothing; as in the saying, فُلَانٌ يَلْبَسُ
السَّوَادَ وَالبَيَاضَ Such a one wears black and white
clothing. (Mgh.) [Hence, also, it has other significations, here following.] ―
-b4-  (assumed tropical:)  Milk. (K.) See
an ex., voce سَوَادٌ. ―
-b5-  [(assumed tropical:)  The white of an egg.] ―
-b6-
بَيَاضُ الأَرْضِ (assumed tropical:)  That part of land wherein is no
cultivation nor population and the like. (M.) ―
-b7-
بَيَاضُ الجِلْدِ (assumed tropical:)  That part of the skin upon which
is no hair. (M.) ―
-b8-  (tropical:)  بَيَاضٌ also signifies (tropical:)  A
man's person; like سَوَادٌ; syn. شَخْصٌ; as in the
saying, لَا يُزَايِلُ سَوَادِى بَيَاضَكَ (tropical:)  My person will
not separate itself from thy person. (As, A, TA.)
بَيُوضٌ A hen that lays many eggs; (S, M, A, *
K; *) as also ↓ بَيَّاضَةٌ: (M:) [but in the Msb it
is evidently used as signifying simply oviparous:]
pl. (of the former, S, M *) بُيُضٌ (S, M, A, K) and
بِيضٌ, (S, M, K,) the latter in the dial. of those
who say رُسْلٌ for رُسُلٌ, the ب being with kesr in
order that the ى may remain unchanged; (S,
M;) but sometimes they said بُوضٌ. (M.)
بَيَاضَةٌ: see بَيَاضٌ.
بَائِضٌ A hen, (Az, K,) or bird, (S, Msb,) and
the like, (Msb,) laying an egg or eggs: (Az, S, *
Msb, K: *) without ة because the cock does not
lay eggs: (Az, TA:) or it is applied also to a
cock, (M, TA,) and to a crow, (M, A, TA,) [as
meaning begetting an egg or eggs,] in like manner
as one uses the word وَالِدٌ. (M, TA.)
بَيَّاضٌ A bleacher of clothes; as a kind of rel. n.;
not as a verbal epithet; for were it this, it would
be مُبَيِّضٌ. (M.) ―
-b2-  A seller of eggs. (M.) ―
-b3-
بَيَّاضَةٌ: see بَيُوضٌ.
أَبْيَضُ White; contr. of أَسْوَدُ; (A, K;) having
whiteness: (Msb:) fem. بَيْضَآءُ: (Msb:) pl. بِيضٌ,
originally بُيْضٌ, (S, Msb, K,) the damm being
converted into kesr in order that the ى may
remain unchanged, (S, K,) [i. e.] to suit the ى.
(Msb.) In the phrase أَعْطِنِى أَبْيَضَّهْ, mentioned
by Sb, as used by some of the Arabs, meaning
أَبْيَضَ, [i. e. Give thou to me a white one,] ه is
subjoined as it is in هُنَّهْ for هُنَّ, and the ض is
doubled because the letter of declinability cannot
have ه subjoined to it; wherefore the letter of
declinability is the first ض, and the second is the
augmentative, and for this reason it has subjoined
to it the ه whereof the purpose is to render plainly
perceivable the vowel [which is necessarily added
after the doubled ض]: Aboo-'Alee says, [app. of
the ه,] that it should properly have neither fet-h
nor any vowel. (M.) ―
-b2-  Applied to a man &c.,
it was sometimes used to signify White in complexion: but in this sense they generally used the
epithet أَحْمَرُ. (IAth, TA in art. حمر.) They also
said, فُلَانٌ أَبْيَضُ الوَجْهِ and فُلَانَةُ بَيْضَآءُ الوَجْهِ,
meaning Such a man, and such a woman, is clear,
in face, from freckles or the like, and unseemly
blackness. (Az, TA.) And they used بِيضَانٌ, (S,
K,) a pl. of أَبْيَضُ, (TA,) in the contr. of the sense
of سُودَانٌ, (S, K,) [i. e. as signifying Whites,]
applied to men: (S:) though they applied the
appellation أَبُو البَيْضَآءِ to the Abyssinian: (TA in
art. عور:) or to the negro: and أَبُو الجَوْنِ to the
white man. (ISk.) But accord. to Th, أَبْيَضُ
applied to a man signifies only (tropical:)  Pure; free from
faults: (IAth, TA in art. حمر:) or, so applied,
unsullied in honour, nobility, or estimation; (Az,
K;) free from faults; and generous: and so
بَيْضَآءُ applied to a woman. (Az.) [In the lexicons,
however, (see, for ex., among countless other
instances, an explanation of بَضَّةٌ in the S,) and in
other post-classical works, it is generally used,
when thus applied, in its proper sense, of White;
or fair in complexion.] ―
-b3-  كَتِيبَةٌ بَيْضَآءُ An army,
or a portion thereof, upon which the whiteness of
the [arms or armour of] iron is apparent. (M.)
―
-b4-  And بَيْضَآءُ alone, [as a subst.,] A piece of
paper [without writing]. (Har p. 311.) ―
-b5-  الأَبْيَضُ
The sword: (S, A, K:) because of its whiteness:
(TA:) pl. بِيضٌ. (S.) ―
-b6-  Silver: (A, K:) because
of its whiteness: like as gold is called الأَحْمَرُ
[because of its redness]. (TA.) ―
-b7-  The saliva
(رضاب) of the mouth. (Ham p. 348.) ―
-b8-  A certain star in the margin of the milky way. (A,
K.) ―
-b9-  البَيْضَآءُ The sun: because of its whiteness.
(M.) ―
-b10-  Waste, or uncultivated, or uninhabited,
land: (K, * TA: [in the CK الجِرابُ is erroneously
put for الخَرَابُ:]) opposed to السَّوْدَآءُ: because
dead lands are white; and when planted, become
black and green. (TA.) See also بَيْضَةٌ, near the
end. ―
-b11-  Wheat: (K:) as also السَّمْرَآءُ. (TA.) ―
-b12-
Fresh [grain of the kind called] سُلْت. (El-
Khattábee, K.) ―
-b13-  A certain kind of wood; that
which is called الحَوَرُ: (K in art. حور:) because
of its whiteness. (TA in that art.) [See حَوَرٌ.]
―
-b14-  The cooking-pot; as also أُمُّ بَيْضَآءَ. (AA, K.)
―
-b15-  The snare with which one catches game. (IAar,
K.) ―
-b16-  الأَبْيَضَانِ Milk and water. (ISk, S, M,
A, K.) A poet says,
وَمَا لِىَ إِلَّا الأَبْيَضَيْنِ شَرَابُ
[And I have not any beverage except milk and
water]. (ISk, S, M.) ―
-b17-  Bread and water: (As,
M, K:) or wheat and water: (Fr, K:) or fat
and milk. (AO, K.) ―
-b18-  Fat and youthfulness
(AZ, IAar, M, A, K.) You say, ذَهَبَ أَبْيَضَاهُ His
fat and youthfulness departed. (TA.) ―
-b19-  مَا رَأَيْتُهُ
مُذْ أَبْيَضَانِ I have not seen him for, or during,
two days: (Ks, M, A, K:) or two months. (Ks,
M, K.) ―
-b20-  أَيَّامُ البِيضِ, (Msb, K,) or simply البِيضُ,
(Mgh,) for أَيَّامُ اللَّيَالِى البِيضِ; [The days of the
white nights;] i. e. the days of the thirteenth and
fourteenth and fifteenth nights of the month;
(Mgh, Msb, K;) so called because they are
lighted by the moon throughout: (Msb:) or of
the twelfth and thirteenth and fourteenth nights:
(K:) but this is of weak authority, and extr.:
the former is the correct explanation: (MF, TA:)
you should not say الأَيَّامُ البِيضُ: (Ibn-El-Jawá-
leekee, IB, K:) yet thus it is in most relations of
a trad. in which it occurs; and some argue for it;
and the author of the K has himself explained
الأَوَاضِحُ by الأَيَّامُ البِيضُ. (TA.) ―
-b21-  سَنَةٌ بَيْضَآءُ (assumed tropical:)  A
year [of scarcity of herbage,] such as is a mean
between that which is termed شَهْبَآء and that which
is termed حَمْرَآء. (TA in art. شهب.) ―
