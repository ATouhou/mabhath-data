Pleiades. (M.) [So too البَلَدُ الأَمِينُ and البَلَدُ
الحَرَامُ &c.] بَلَدٌ مَيِّتٌ means A tract of land
without herbage, or pasture: (Msb:) and بَلَدٌ
alone, a [desert, a waterless desert, or such as is

sand, or in a desert: (M, L:) also called ↓ البَلَدِيَّةِ
and ذَاتُ البَلَدِ. (M.) You say, فُلَانٌ بَيْضَةُ البَلَدِ
[(tropical:)  Such a one is like the egg of the ostrich, &c.],
meaning such a one is unequalled, or unparalleled:
said in dispraise and in praise: (M, * L:) allowed
by A'Obeyd to be used in praise: and said by
El-Bekree to be applied to him who is separated
from his family and near relations. (TA.) [See
also art. بيض.] You also say, هُوَ أَذَلُّ مِنْ بَيْضَةِ
البَلَدِ (S, M, A) (tropical:)  He is more object, or vile, than
the egg of the ostrich, which it abandons (S, TA)

بَيْضَةِ البَلَدِ (tropical:)  [He is more highly esteemed than the
egg of the ostrich, which it lays in the sand];
because the ostrich spreads its wings over it and
sits upon it. (A in art. فرخ.) [See more in art.
بيض.] ―
-b2-  A trace, mark, or vestige, (T, S, M, K,
[in the K mentioned in two places, but in the
latter of these omitted in the CK,]) of a house,

بَلْدَةٌ: see بَلَدٌ, in three places. You say, إِنْ لَمْ
تَفْعَلْ كَذَا فَهِىَ بَلْدَةٌ بَيْنِى وَ بَيْنِكَ (tropical:)  If thou do not
thus, it will be [a cause of] separation between

-b2-

of the year: (S:) [see مَنَازِلُ القَمَر, in art. نزل:
in the K it is also said that ↓ البَلَدُ is a Mansion
of the Moon; but this appears to be a mistake,
occasioned by the accidental omission of the word
البَلْدَةُ; though البَلَدُ would seem to be an appropriate name for the mansion next after the نعائم:]
IF says that البَلْدَةُ is a star, or an asterism,
(نَجْمٌ,) said to be the بَلْدَة, i. e. breast, of the
Lion; not meaning the mansion thus called in
the sign of Sagittarius: El-Hareeree finds fault
with him for using this expression, [the بلدة of
the Lion,] but Ibn-Dhafr replies that it occurs
in the language. (TA.) ―
-b4-  بَلْدَةٌ also signifies
The earth, or ground. (S.) ―

زَوُر: or the part called رَحَى الزَّوْرِ: (M:) or [so
accord. to the M, but accord. to the K “and,”]
the breast, syn. صَدْر, (S, M, A, K,) of a camel,

the two prominent portions of flesh of the breast of
a horse, extending to the arms. (M, L.) Dhu-rRummeh says,
أُنِيخَتْ فَأَلْقَتْ بَلْدَةً فَوْقَ بَلْدَةٍ
She (the camel) was made to lie down, and threw
her breast upon [a tract of] ground. (S, M.)
And you say, فُلَانٌ وَاسِعُ البَلْدَةِ Such a one is
wide in the breast. (S.) ―
-b6-  Also (tropical:)  The palm of the
hand. (M, A, TA. [In the K, by the accidental
