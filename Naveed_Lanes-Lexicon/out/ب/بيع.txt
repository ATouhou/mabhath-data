بيع1
بَاعَهُ, (S, Mgh, &c.,) aor. يَبِيعُ, (S, Msb, K,)
inf. n. بَيْعٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and مَبِيعٌ, (S, Msb,
K,) which latter is anomalous, (S,) the regular
form being مَبَاعٌ, (S, K,) has two contr. significacations: He sold it: and he bought it: (S, Mgh,
Msb, K:) and ↓ اباعهُ is a dial. var. of the same:
(IKtt, Msb:) [but app. only in the former sense:]
or this last signifies he offered it for sale; or exposed it to sale: (S, K:) and ↓ ابتاعهُ, as well as
بَاعَهُ, signifies he bought it. (S, * Mgh, * Msb, K.)
The primary signification of بَيْعٌ is The exchanging,
or exchange, of property; or the making an exchange with property; as in the phrases بَيْعٌ رَابِحٌ
[an exchange of property bringing gain], and
بَيْعٌ خَاسِرٌ [an exchange of property occasioning
loss]: and this is a proper signification when it
relates to real substances: but it is tropically used
to signify the making the contract [of sale and
purchase]; because this is the means of giving
[and obtaining] possession: [though this signification is what is termed حَقِيقَةٌ عُرْفِيَّةٌ, i. e., a sense
so common as to be conventionally regarded as
proper:] the phrase صَحَّ البَيْعُ, or بَطَلَ, and the
like, mean صَفْقَةُ البَيْعِ; [i. e. The contract of sale,
or purchase, was valid, or was null;] but the
prefixed n. being suppressed, and its complement
[alone] used for it, and this being masc., the verb
is made masc. (Msb.) بَاعَ [mostly signifies He
sold; and] is doubly trans., both by itself and by
means of مِنْ prefixed to the second object; (Mgh,
Msb;) this prep. being thus used as a corroborative: (Msb:) you say, بَاعَهُ الشَّىْءَ and بَاعَهُ مِنْهُ
[He sold to him the thing and He sold it to
him]: (Mgh:) and بِعْتُ زَيْدًا الدَّارَ and بِعْتُ مِنْ
زَيْدٍ الدَّارَ [I sold to Zeyd the house: (see also an
explanation of the phrase اِسْتَبَعْتُهُ الشَّىْءَ: and see
بَاعَهُ مِنَ السُّلْطَانِ: to which might be added
countless similar instances; for when باع signifies
he sold, مِنْ is generally prefixed to the noun or
pronoun denoting the person to whom the thing
is sold:)] and sometimes لِ is put in the place of
مِنْ; so that you say, بِعْتُكَ الشَّىْءَ and بِعْتُهُ لَكَ [I
sold to thee the thing and I sold it to thee]; the
ل being redundant [when the verb has this meaning, though not when it has the contr. meaning,
as will be seen below]. (Msb.) Of the contr.
signification we have an ex. in the saying of ElFarezdak,
إِنَّ الشَّبَابَ لَرَابِحٌ مَنْ بَاعَهَا
وَالشَّيْبُ لَيْسَ لِبَائِعِيهِ تِجَارُ
[Verily youthfulness, he who buys it is a gainer;
but hoariness, there are no traffickers for its
sellers; the part. a. being here from the verb in
the former sense]: (S, TA:) and [often in a case
in which the verb is followed by ل; as] in بَاعَ لَهُ
الشَّىْءَ He bought for him the thing; (Mgh;) [the
ل not being redundant when the verb is used in
this sense;] and as in the saying of Tarafeh,
وَيَأْتِيكَ بالْأَخْبَارِ مَنْ لَمْ تَبِعْ لَهُ
بَتَاتًا وَلَمْ تَضْرِبْ لَهُ وَقْتَ مَوْعِدِ
[And he will bring thee tidings for whom thou hast
not bought travelling-provisions, and for whom
thou hast not assigned an appointed time for his
bringing them]: (TA:) and in the saying, بَاعَ
دُنْيَاهُ بِآخِرَتِهِ (tropical:)  [He purchased his enjoyments of
the present world at the expense of his enjoyments
of the world to come]: (Z, TA:) and [in like
manner] you say, زَيْدٌ الدَّارَ ↓ ابتاع, meaning Zeyd
bought the house: and لِغَيْرِهِ ↓ ابتاعها He bought it
for another person. (Msb.) The verb has this
signification, also, in the trad., لَا يَبِعْ بَعْضُكُمْ عَلَى
بَيْعِ أَخِيهِ [One of you shall not buy in opposition
to the buying of his brother when an agreement
has been manifested but the contract has not been
concluded]; (S, IAth, Mgh, Msb; [but in the S
and Msb and by IAth, the trad. is related thus;
لَا يَخْطُبِ الرَّجُلُ عَلَى خِطْبَةِ أَخِيهِ وَلَا يَبِعْ عَلَى بَيْعِ
أَخِيهِ; (see art. خطب;)]) as is shown by the
relation of Bkh, الرَّجُلُ عَلَى بَيْعِ أَخِيهِ ↓ لَا يَبْتَاعُ:
(Mgh, Msb:) or it may here have the contr.
meaning: (IAth:) Az says that the seller and
buyer are equal in offence when either of them
does thus to another. (TA.) [Similar to this is
the saying, لَا يَسُومُ الرَّجُلُ عَلَى سَوْمِ أَخِيهِ: see
art. سوم. See also بَاعَ عَلَى بَيْعِهِ below, used in
a tropical sense.] You say also, بَاعَ عَلَيْهِ القَاضِى,
meaning The judge sold against his will; (Mgh;)
sold without his consent. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  The pass.
form is بِيعَ [It was sold: and it was bought]: (S,
K:) optionally either [thus] with kesr to the ب,
or [بُيْعَ] with damm to the ب, (S,) [or rather
with a sound between that of damm and that of
kesr, which pronunciation is termed إِشْمَامٌ;] and
some say بُوعَ; (S, K;) changing the ى into و:
and thus in the cases of كِيلَ and قِيلَ and the
like: (S:) [but Ibn-Málik requires damm or
اشمام in the passive of a verb of which the medial
radical is ى, and kesr or اشمام in the passive of a
verb of which the medial radical is و, to prevent
the mistaking of an active verb for a passive in
such cases as بِعْتُ and سُمْتُ: others, however,
only prefer what Ibn-Málik absolutely requires in
these cases. (See I'Ak p. 131.)] ―
-b3-  You say also,
بَاعَهُ مِنَ السُّلْطَانِ, [lit. He sold him to the Sultán,]
meaning (tropical:)  he slandered him, or calumniated him,
to the Sultán. (K, TA.) ―
-b4-  And بَاعَ فُلَانٌ عَلَى
بَيْعِهِ, [of which the lit. meaning has been shown
above,] meaning (tropical:)  Such a one superseded him, or
occupied his place, in respect of honourable and
elevated station or rank, and gained the mastery
over him; (K, * TA;) and so حَلَّ بِوَادِيهِ: (TA:)
or بَاعَ فُلَانٌ عَلَى بَيْعِ فُلَانٍ means (tropical:)  such a one
gained the mastery over such a one, and wrested
from him that which he sought to obtain from
him; and is an old proverb, applied by the
Arabs to a man who contends with another, and
seeks to obtain a thing from him by superior power
or force, when he has succeeded in doing as above
explained; and similar to it is the saying شَقَّ فُلَانٌ
غُبَارَ فُلَانٍ. (El-Mufaddal Ed-Dabbee, TA.) One
also says, مَا بَاعَ عَلَى بَيْعِكَ أَحَدٌ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  Not
any one has equalled thee. (TA.)
-A2-  بَيْعٌ is also
used in the sense of اِنْبِسَاطٌ. (TA in art. بوع.
[See اِنْبَاعَ in that art.])

بَايَعْتُهُ, (S, Mgh, TA,) inf. n. مُبَايَعَةٌ and
بِيَاعٌ, (TA,) is from البَيْعُ; and so is ↓ التَّبَايُعُ;
(S, TA;) this being syn. with المُبَايَعَةُ. (K, TA.)
You say, بَايَعَا and ↓ تَبَايَعَا, meaning They two
sold and bought, each with the other: (TK:) and
↓ تَبَايَعْنَا [We sold and bought, one with another]:
(Mgh:) and بايعهُ also signifies He bartered, or
exchanged commodities, with him. (TA.) [See
1; where a citation from the Msb indicates that
this latter is the primary signification accord. to
the author of that work.] ―
-b2-  It is also from البَيْعَةُ;
and so is ↓ التَّبَايُعُ: (S, TA: *) المُبَايَعَةُ and ↓ التَّبَايُعُ
from البَيْعَةُ signifying The making a covenant, a
compact, an engagement, or the like; as though
each of the two parties sold what he had to the
other, and gave him his own special property,
and his obedience, and all that pertained to his
case. (TA.) [Hence,] بايع الأَمِيرَ He promised,
or swore, allegiance to the prince; making a covenant with him to submit to him the judgment of
his own case and of the cases of the Muslims [in
general], not to dispute with him in respect of
anything thereof, but to obey him in whatever
command he might impose upon him, pleasing
and displeasing: in doing which, it was usual
for the person making this covenant to place his
hand in the hand of the prince, in confirmation
of the covenant, like as is done by the seller and
buyer; wherefore the act was termed بَيْعَةٌ, an
inf. n. [of un.] of بَاعَ. (Ibn-Khaldoon, in De
Sacy's Chrest. Ar., 2nd ed., ii. 256 — 7.) [And
hence the phrases, بُويِعَ بِالِخِلَافَةِ and بُويِعَ لَهُ
بِالخِلَافَةِ He had the promise, or oath, of allegiance made to him as being Khaleefeh.] You
say also, بايعهُ عَلَيْهِ, inf. n. مُبَايَعَةٌ, He made a
covenant, a compact, an engagement, or the like,
with him, respecting it, or to do it: and ↓ تبايعوا
عَلَى الأَمْرِ [they made a covenant, &c., respecting,
or to do, the thing, or affair]; like as you say
أَصْفَقُوا عَلَيْهِ. (TA.)

إِنْبَيَعَ انباع It was, or became, saleable, or easy of
sale; it had an easy, or a ready, sale: (Ibn-
'Abbád, K:) as though quasi-pass. of بَاعَهُ [and
therefore primarily signifying it was, or became,
sold, or bought]. (TA.)

إِبْتَيَعَ see 1, in four places.

اِسْتَبَعْتُهُ الشَّىْءَ I asked him to sell the thing
to me; expl. by سَأَلْتُهُ أَنْ يَبِيعَهُ مِنِّى; (S, K; *)
for instance, عَبْدَهُ [his slave.] (Mgh.)
بَيْعٌ inf. n. of 1 [q. v.]. ―
-b2-  It also signifies The
hire, or hiring, of land. (TA.)
-A2-  Also A thing
sold, or bought: (Mgh, Msb, TA:) a subst. in
this sense: (Mgh, TA:) pl. بُيُوعٌ: (Mgh, Msb,
TA:) which is also used as a pl. of the inf. n.,
to signify Kinds of selling and buying. (Mgh.)
See also بِيَاعَةٌ.

-b2-  Hence,] A striking together of the hands of two contracting
parties in token of the ratification of a sale.
(Msb, TA.) ―
-b3-  And [hence,] The act of مُبَايَعَة
[or promising, or swearing, allegiance and obedience, as explained above, (see 3,)] and submission,
or obedience. (Msb, TA.) Whence, أَيْمَانُ البَيْعَةِ
[The oaths of allegiance and obedience]; (Ibn-Khaldoon, in De Sacy's Chrest. Ar., 2nd ed.,
ii. 257; and Msb;) which the Khaleefehs exacted; (Ibn-Khaldoon;) and which El-Hajjáj
appointed, including hard, or difficult, matters,
relating to divorce and emancipation and fasting
and the like. (Msb.)
بِيعَةٌ A mode, or manner, of selling or buying.
(S, Mgh, K.) Hence, صَاحِبُ بِيعَةٍ [A person
occupying himself in any kind of selling or buying]: occurring in a trad. of Ibn-'Omar. (Mgh,
TA.) And إِنَّهُ لَحَسَنُ البِيعَةِ [Verily he is good
in the manner of selling or buying]. (S, Mgh,
TA.)
-A2-  [A Christian church;] a place of worship
(K) pertaining to the Christians: (S, Mgh, Msb,
K:) or, as some say, a synagogue of the Jews:
(TA:) pl. بِيَعٌ, (K, TA,) or بِيْعٌ. (Msb: [but
this I think a mistake: if correct, it is a coll.
gen. n.])
بَيُوعٌ: see بَيِّعٌ.
بَيَاعَةٌ An article of merchandise; (Lth, S, K;)
as also ↓ بَيْعٌ [q. v. suprà]: (Mgh:) pl. of the
former بِيَاعَاتٌ. (K.)
بَيِّعٌ: see بَائِعٌ, in five places. ―
-b2-  Also A man
who sells, or buys, well; and so ↓ بَيُوعٌ: fem. of
the former with ة: pl. mase. بَيِّعُونَ, and pl. fem.
بَيِّعَاتٌ; neither the masc. nor the fem. having a
broken pl. (TA.)
بَيَّاعٌ A man who sells, or buys, much. (TA.)
بَائِعٌ Selling, or a seller: and buying, or a
buyer: (Msb, K, * TA:) as also ↓ بَيِّعٌ: (K:) the
former signification is the more obvious when
بائع is used without restriction: (Msb:) and ↓ بَيِّعٌ
also signifies [accord. to some] a bargainer, or
chafferer; (K, TA;) not a seller nor a buyer;
but Esh-Sháfi'ee and Az deny that this epithet is
applied to a man before he has concluded the
contract: (L, TA:) the pl. of بائع is بَاعَةٌ: (ISd,
K:) and the pl. of ↓ بيّع is بِيَعَآءُ [or rather this is
a quasi-pl. n.] and أَبْيعَآءُ: (K:) and Kr holds
that بَاعَةٌ is pl. of بيّع. (TA.) ↓ البَيِّعَانِ signifies The
seller and the buyer; (S, Mgh;) and so ↓ المُتَبَايِعَانِ.
(TA.) It is said in a trad., بِالخِيَارِ مَا ↓ البَيِّعَانِ
لَمْ يَتَفَرَّقَا, and in another, ↓ المُتَبَايِعَانِ, [The seller
and the buyer have the option of cancelling the
contract as long as they have not separated.]
(TA.) ―
-b2-  اِمْرَأَةٌ بَائِعٌ (tropical:)  A woman who easily obtains
a suitor; or who is much in demand; by reason
of her beauty: (K, TA:) as though she sold
herself: like نَاقَةٌ تَاجِرَةٌ. (Z, TA.)
مَبِيعٌ Sold: and bought: as also ↓ مَبْيُوعٌ: (S,
K:) in the latter sense syn. with ↓ مُبْتَاعٌ. (Msb.)
Kh says that the letter suppressed in مَبِيعٌ is the
و of the measure مَفْعُولٌ, because it is augmentative: but Akh says that the letter suppressed is
the medial radical; for when they made the ى
quiescent, they transferred its vowel to the letter
before it, so that it became madmoomeh, [the
word thus being altered to مَبُيْوعٌ,] then they
changed the dammeh into kesreh because of the
ى after it, then the ى was suppressed, and the
و was changed into ى, like the و of مِيزَانٌ,
because of the kesreh: accord. to El-Mázinee,
each of these sayings is good; but that of Akh is
the more agreeable with analogy. (S.)
مَبْيُوعٌ: see مَبِيعٌ.
مُبْتَاعٌ: see مَبِيعٌ.
مُتَبَايِعٌ: see بَائِعٌ, in two places.
