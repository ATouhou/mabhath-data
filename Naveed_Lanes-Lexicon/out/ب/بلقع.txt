Q. 3
اِبْلَنْقَعَ It (sorrow, grief, or anxiety, such
as is termed كَرْب,) became removed, or cleared
away. (K.) ―
-b2-  It (the dawn) shone, or shone
brightly. (K.) ―

بَلْقَعٌ and ↓ بَلْقَعَةٌ A land that is vacant, or
void; destitute of herbage or pasturage, and of
human beings, &c.; (S, K;) in which is nothing:
(S:) or the former signifies a vacant, or void,
place: (Mgh:) [or instead of using the former
alone, you say أَرْضٌ بَلْقَعٌ; for] you say مَنْزِلٌ
بَلْقَعٌ [a vacant, or void, place of alighting or
abiding], (S, TA,) and دَارٌ بَلْقَعٌ [a vacant, or
void, house &c.], without ة, when it is an epithet,
(S, TA,) applied to a mase. subst. and to a fem.;
(TA;) but if it be a subst., you say, اِنْتَهَيْنَا إِلَى
مَلْسَآءَ ↓ بَلْقَعَةٍ [we came at last to a smooth, vacant,
or void, land]: (S, TA:) and ↓ بَلْقَعَةٌ also signifies a land in which are no trees, either in sands
or in plain or level tracts: (TA:) or a vacant
land, in which is no one, whether there be in it
herbage or not, and whether plain or not: (Ham
p. 445:] pl. بَلَاقِعُ. (S, Mgh, K.) It is said in
a trad., اليَمِينُ الفَاجِرَةُ تَذَرُ (S, Mgh,
TA; but in the second and third of these, in the
place of تَذَرُ, we find تَدَعُ;) The false oath causes
the places of abode to become void, or vacant; i. e.,
by reason of its evil influence, the possessions and
their possessors perish; (Mgh;) or the [false]
swearer becomes poor, and the property that was
in his house goes away; (Sh;) or God renders
him in a state of disunion, and changes the blessings which He had conferred upon him: (TA:)
accord. to another relation, the words of the trad.
are اليَمِينُ الغَمُوسُ الخ. (Mgh.) You say also,
دِيَارٌ بَلْقَعٌ [Vacant, or void, places of abode]; as
though the places were one place: (TA:) and
Ru-beh says,
فَأَصْبَحَتْ دَارَهُمُ بَلَاقِعَا
[And their abode became vacant]: (TA:) and it
is said in a trad., أَصْبَحَتِ الأَرْضُ بَلَاقِعَ [as though
meaning the land became altogether vacant]; the
pl. being used to render the meaning intensive,
as in the phrases أَرْضٌ سَبَاسِبُ and ثَوْبٌ أَخْلَاقٌ;
(IAth, TA;) or because every portion thereof is
considered as being بلقع. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also, without
ة and ↓ with ة, (tropical:)  A woman devoid of every good
quality. (K, TA.) ―
-b3-  IF says that the ل in بَلْقَعٌ
is augmentative. (TA.)
بَلْقَعَةٌ: see بَلْقَعٌ, in four places.
بَلْقَعِىٌّ An arrow, or a spear-head, bright, or
free from rust, in the point. (K.)
صَلَنْقَعٌ بَلَنْقَعٌ is an expression applied to A road
[as though meaning made bare by the feet of men
and beasts]. (I 'Abbád, K.)
