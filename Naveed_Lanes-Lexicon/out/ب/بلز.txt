بلزطِينُ الْإِبْلِيزِ The mud of Egypt; (K;) what
the Nile leaves behind it after retiring from the
surface of the ground: (TA:) a foreign word
[arabicized, perhaps from the Greek
πηλὸ�, as
suggested by De Sacy; who also remarks that it
might be derived from the Greek
ἰλ� degrees� with the
Egyptian masc. art. πι, were it not that ἰλ� degrees� is
fem.: (see his “Abd-allatif,” p. 8:) if we might
suppose ابليز to be an old mistranscription for
ايليز, we might with good reason derive it from
ἰλ� degrees�, which, as pronounced by the modern Greeks,
very nearly resembles إِيلِيز in sound]: (K:) [some
of] the vulgar pronounce it with س. (TA.) ―
-b2-
[Also applied to Clay; plastic clay; or potters'
earth.]
