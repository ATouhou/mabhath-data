بُسْتَانٌ [accord. to its etymology (which will
be explained below) and to general modern usage,
A garden of sweet-scented flowers and trees: but
accord. to the Arabic Lexicons,] a [garden such
as is termed] جَنَّة: (Mgh, Msb:) or a [garden,
or walled garden, such as is termed] حَدِيقَة, (M,
K, TA,) of palm-trees; as in a poem of El-Aashà:
(TA:) said by Fr to be an Arabic word; (Msb,
TA;) but this is denied by IDrd: (TA:) and
said by some to be رُومِىّ [or Greek]: (Msb:)
[but correctly] it is an arabicized word, from [the
Persian] بُوسْتَانٌ [bóstán]; (K, [in which the ن
is regarded as a radical letter,] Shifá el-Ghaleel,
MF,) meaning “taking odour, or fragrance,” or,
as some say, “a place where odour, or fragrance,
collects, or is collected:” (Shifá el-Ghaleel, MF:)
its composition from بو and ستان requires the
former meaning to be assigned to it: (TA:) [or
rather it signifies “a place of odour, or fragrance:”] afterwards applied to trees: (TA:) pl.
بَسَاتِينُ (Msb, K) and بَسَاتُونَ, (K,) like شَيَاطِينُ
and شَيَاطُونَ. (TA.)
