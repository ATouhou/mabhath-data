بنّن, (K,) inf. n. تَبْنِينٌ, (TA,) He tied a
sheep, or goat, in order to fatten it: (K:) from
بَنَّ بِالْمَكَانِ. (TA.)
4
ابنّ بِالْمَكَانِ, (T, S, M, Msb, K,) inf. n.
إِبْنَانٌ; (Lth, T;) and بِهِ ↓ بَنَّ, aor. يَبِنُّ, (M, K,)
inf. n. بَنٌّ; (M, TA;) but As allows only the
former verb; (M, TA;) He remained, continued,
stayed, dwelt, or abode, in the place; (T, S, M,
Msb, K;) he kept, or clave, to the place. (Lth,
T, TA.) Accord. to Z, it is a tropical meaning,
from the بَنَّة [i. e. odour] of the camels or cattle
[of a stationary people]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And أَبَنَّتِ
السَّحَابَةُ (assumed tropical:)  The cloud remained, or continued raining, (M, TA,) some days, (TA,) and kept its
place. (M.)
5
تبنّن He acted, or proceeded, deliberately,
not hastily. (T, TA.) An Arab of the desert
said to Shureyh, on his desiring to pronounce
judgment against him hastily, تَبَنَّنْ, meaning Act
thou deliberately, not hastily. (T.)
بَنْ is a dial. var. of بَلْ, (M, K,) and so is
لَا بَنْ of لَا بَلْ; or, as some say, formed by substitution [of ن for ل; not peculiar to any dialect].
(M.) One says, بَنْ وَاللّٰهِ لَا آتِيكَ [Nay, by God, I
will not come to thee]: Fr says that it is of the dial.
of Benoo-Saad and Kelb; and that he had heard
the Báhilees say, لَا بَنْ, meaning بَلْ [or لَا بَلْ]:
but IJ says, I do not trace up بَنْ [to any authority] as being an independent word of a particular
dialect. (TA.)
-A2-  [بْنُ and بْنِ and بْنَ, for ابْنُ
&c.: see art. بنى.]
بُنٌّ [Coffee-berries, whether green or roasted,
whole or reduced to powder by pounding or
grinding;] expl. in the K as شَىْءٌ يُتَّخَذُ كَالمُرِّىِّ
[a certain thing that is taken like the condiment
termed مُرِّيّ, which is used to give relish to food
or to quicken the appetite]; Ibn-Es-Sim'ánee says,
هُوَشَىْءٌ فِى الكَوَامِيخِ [app. meaning it is a thing
reckoned among what are termed كواميخ, pl. of
كَامَخٌ, which signifies the same as مُرِّىٌّ, for it seems
that فى is here used in the sense of مِنْ, or it
may be a mistranscription for مِنْ]; the physician
Dáwood says, it is the produce of certain trees in
El-Yemen; the berries thereof are put into the
earth in آذَار [the Syrian month corresponding to
March, O. S.], and it increases, and is gathered
in أَبِيب [the Coptic month commencing on the
25th of June, O. S.; the 7th of July, N. S.];
it grows to the height of about three cubits, on a
stem of the thickness of the thumb, and has a
white flower, which is succeeded by a berry like
the hazel-nut; sometimes it is cut like beans;
and sometimes, when it is divested of its covering,
it divides into two halves: it has been proved to
be good for alleviating humidities, and cough,
and phlegm, and defluxions, and for opening
obstructions, and causing a flow of the urine:
when roasted, [and pounded or ground,] and well
cooked, [i. e. boiled in water,] it is now commonly
known by the name of قَهْوَة. (TA.) [Golius, I
think, has misunderstood the explanation of this
word in the K: after having given that explanation, and rendered it by “ res quæ sumitur instar
المرى Múrriji,” he adds, “Pers. ابكامه Abcâma
dictæ: hæc sorbitio est rei ex hordeo et frumento
paratæ multa cura et arte, quam Malajesa et
Halimæus describunt. ” He then mentions the
signification of coffee-berries as a second and distinct meaning.]
بِنٌّ A place having a fetid odour. (Fr, T, K.)
-A2-  It also signifies طِرْقٌ مِنَ الشَّحْمِ (T, K) and
السِّمَنِ (K, TA: in the CK السَّمْنِ:) [said in the
TA to mean قُوَّةٌ مِنْهُمَا, i. e. Strength arising from
fat and from fatness: but I think that وَالسِّمَنِ
has been added in the K in consequence of a
misunderstanding, and that the meaning is a layer
of fat; this meaning seeming to be indicated by
the ex. here following, and corroborated by significations of several conjugates of طِرْقٌ, as طَرِيقَةٌ
and طَرَقٌ and طِرَاقٌ &c.] One says (T, K) of a
beast (دَابَّة) when it has become fat, (T,) رَكِبَهَا بِنٌّ
عَلَىبِنٍ (T, K *) and طِرْقٌ عَلَى طِرْقٍ (T) [clearly
I think, meaning Layer upon layer, of fat, has
accumulated upon it.]
بَنَّةٌ A sweet, or pleasant, odour; (As, AA, T,
S, M, K;) such as that of the apple (T, M) and
the like, (M,) or the quince: (T:) Sb says that
it is a name for a sweet, or pleasant, odour, like
خَمْطَةٌ: (M, * TA:) and an unpleasant odour;
(As, T, S;) a fetid odour; (M, K;) whence
بَنَّةٌ الغَزْلِ [the odour of the yarn] occurring in a
saying of 'Alee, respecting a weaver; (M;) which
shows that A'Obeyd erred in asserting it to have
only the first of the foregoing significations; (IB,
TA;) which Suh, in the R, assigns also to ↓ بُنَانَةٌ:
(TA:) the odour of sheep, or goats, (S, M,) or of
camels or cattle; (Z, TA;) and of the dung of
gazelles; (S, K;) and of the lodging-places of
sheep or goats and of oxen or bulls or cows and of
gazelles: (T, M:) and sometimes the lodgingplaces themselves, of sheep or goats: (M, TA:)
pl. (in all the senses, M) بِنَانٌ. (T, S, M, K.)
بُنِّىٌّ A seller of بُنّ [or coffee-berries]. (TA.)
-A2-  Also, [vulgarly pronounced بِنِّى,] A species of
fish; (K;) [the cyprinus Bynni of Forskål;
described by him in his Descr. Anim. p. 71;] it
is white, and is the best kind [of fish], and
abundant in the Nile. (TA.)
بَنَانٌ The fingers; syn. أَصَابِعُ: (M, Msb, K:)
but whether it means peculiarly the اصابع of the
hand, or those of the foot also, [i. e. the toes,] is
disputed: (TA:) or the ends, or extremities,
thereof: (S, M, Msb, K:) said to be so called
because by their means are ordered those circumstances whereby man continues in existence; from
أَبَنَّ بِالْمَكَانِ: (Msb:) mentioned in the Kur viii. 12
because therewith one fights, and defends himself:
(Er-Rághib, TA:) or it there signifies all the
limbs, or members, of the body: (Aboo-Is-hák,
M:) or the fingers, or toes, and any other parts
of all the limbs, or members: (Zj, TA:) or it
means in the Kur the شَوَى; (Lth, T, TA;) so in
lxxv. 4; (M;) i. e. the arms or hands and the
legs or feet: (Lth, T, TA:) accord. to El-Fárisee
the meaning of the words in the Kur lxxv. 4 is,
we are able to make their extremities like those
of the camel, so that they should not profit by
them in handicraft: (M, TA:) the n. un. is with
ة; (Lth, T, S, M, K;) meaning, accord. to Lth,
a single إِصْبَع [i. e. finger, or toe]; or, accord. to
AHeyth, the whole اصبع; or, as some say, the
highest عُقْدَة [or joint] of the اصبع: (T:) the pl.
of pauc. is بَنَانَاتٌ; but a pl. of mult. is sometimes
used as one of pauc.; and hence the saying of the
rájiz,
خَمْسَ بَنَانٍ قَانِئِ الأَظْفَارِ
[Five fingers, or ends of fingers, intensely red
from the dye of hinnà in the nails], meaning
خَمْسًا مِنَ البَنَانِ: and one says, بَنَانٌ مُخَضَّبٌ
[Fingers, or ends of fingers, dyed, or much dyed,
with hinnà]; for every pl. [or rather coll. gen. n.]
between which and its sing., or n. un., there is no
difference but ة [added in the latter] may be
treated as sing. and masc. (S.) Lth cites as an
ex. of the n. un.,
لَيْسَ لِحَىٍّ فَوْقَهُمْ بَنَانَهْ  لَاهُمَّ أَكْرَمْتَ بَنِى كِنَانَه
meaning [O God, Thou hast honoured the sons
of Kináneh: there belongs not to any tribe] excel-lence of the measure of a finger above them. (T,
TA.)
بَنِيِنٌ Deliberate and intelligent: (AA, T, K:)
from بَنَّ بِالْمَكَانِ. (TA.)
بَنَانَةٌ n. un. of بَنَانٌ. (Lth, T, S, M, K.)
-A2-  See
also what next follows.
بُنَانَةٌ: see بَنَّةٌ. ―
-b2-  Also A meadow, or verdant
tract of land somewhat watery, (AA, T, M, K,)
producing herbage, (M, K,) and adorned with
flowers; (TA;) and so ↓ بَنَانَةٌ. (M.)
مُبِنٌّ Remaining, continuing, staying, dwelling,
or abiding, in a place. (T, TA.) Applied to a
mixture of urine and dung (عَبَس) upon the tail
[of a camel &c.], it may mean Cleaving, and
sticking: or it may be from بَنَّةٌ signifying “ a
fetid odour ” [so as to mean having a fetid odour]:
thus, in this case, it may be either a part. n. or a
possessive epithet. (M, TA.) It signifies also
Having the odour of the dung of gazelles; applied
to a covert, or hiding-place, of those animals,
among trees. (S, K. *)
