بَلُ3َ,
(T, M,) inf. n. بَلٌّ (with fet-h, TA [in the CK it
has kesr]) and بِلَالٌ, (M, K,) (tropical:)  He made close [or
he refreshed] his ties of relationship by behaving
with goodness and affection and gentleness to his
kindred; syn. وَصَلَهَا, (T, S, M, K,) and نَدَّاهَا:
(T:) for, as some things are conjoined and commixed by moisture, and become disunited by
dryness, بَلٌّ is metaphorically used to denote conjunction, as above, and يُبْسٌ to denote the contrary. (TA.) A poet says,
وَالرِّحْمَ فابْلُلْهَا بِخَيْرِ البُلَّانْ
فَإِنَهَااشْتُقَّتْ مِنِ اسْمِ الرَّحْمٰنْ
[(tropical:)  And the ties of relationship, make thou them
close &c. by the best mode, or modes, of doing so;
for the name thereof is derived from the name of
the Compassionate]: here ↓البُلَّان may be a noun
in the sing. number, like غُفْرَانٌ, or it may be
pl. of بَلَلٌ, which may be either a subst. or an.
inf. n., for some inf. ns. have pls., as شُغْلٌ and
عَقْلٌ and مَرَضٌ. (M.) And it is said in a trad.,
بُلُّوا أَرْحَامَكُمْ وَلَوْ بِالسَّلَامِ (tropical:)  Make ye close [or
refresh ye] your ties of relationship &c., though
but,  or if only, by salutation; syn. صِلُوهَا, (M,)
or نَدُّوهَا بِالصِّلَةِ. (S.) And hence the saying in
another trad., إِذَ اسْتَشَنَّ مَا بَيْنَكَ وَ بَيْنَ اللّٰهِ فَابْلُلْهُ
بِالإِحْسَانِ إِلَى عِبَادَهِ (tropical:)  [When the tie between thee
and God wears out, repair thou it, or refresh
thou it, by beneficence to his servants]. (TA.)
[See also بِلَالٌ.] ―
-b4-  بَلَّكَ اللّٰهُ بِابْنٍ, (S, M, K,) and
ابْنًا, (M, K,) (assumed tropical:)  May God give thee a son. (S, M,
K, TA.) Hence, perhaps, the phrase, بُلَّتْ يَدَاكَ بِهِ
as meaning (assumed tropical:)  Thou was given it. (Har p. 479.)
You say also, بَلَلْتُهُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  I gave to him.

بَلْ is a particle of digression: (Mughnee, K:)
or, accord. to Mbr, it denotes emendation, wherever it occurs, in the case of a negation or an
affirmation: (T, TA:) or it is a word of emendation, and denoting digression from that which
precedes; as also بَنْ, in which the ن is a substitute for the ل, because بل is of frequent occurrence,
and بن is rare; or, as IJ says, the latter may be
an independent dial. var. (M.) When it is followed by a proposition, the meaning of the digression is either the cancelling of what precedes, as
in وَقَالُوا اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمٰنُ وَلَدًا سُبْحَانَهُ بَلْ عِبَادٌ مُكْرَمُونَ
[And they said, “The Compassionate hath gotten
offspring: ” extolled be his freedom from that which
is derogatory from his glory! nay, or nay rather, or
nay but, they are honoured servants (Kur xxi. 26)],
or transition from one object of discourse to another, as in قَدْ أَفْلَحَ مَنْ تَزَكَّى وَ ذَكَرَ اسْمَ رَبِّهِ فَصَلَّى
بَلْ تُؤْثِرُونَ الْحَيَاةَ الدُّنْيَا [He hath attained felicity
who hath purified himself, and celebrated the
name of his Lord, and prayed: but ye prefer the
present life (Kur lxxxvii. 14-16)]: (Mughnee,
K: *) and in all such cases it is an inceptive particle; not a conjunctive. (Mughnee.) When it
is followed by a single word, it is a conjunction,
(S, * Msb, * Mughnee, K,) and requires that word
to be in the same case as the word before it: (S:)
and if preceded by a command or an affirmation,
(Mughnee, K,) as in اِضْرَبْ زَيْدًا بَلْ عَمْرًا [Beat
thou Zeyd: no, 'Amr], (Msb, Mughnee, K,) and
قَامَ زَيْدٌ بَلْ عَمْرٌو [Zeyd stood: no, 'Amr], (M,
Mughnee, K,) or جَآءَنِى أَخُوكَ بَلْ أَبُوكَ [Thy
brother came to me: no, thy father], (S,) it
makes what precedes it to be as though nothing
were said respecting it, (S, * Msb, * Mughnee, K,)
making the command or affirmation to relate to
what follows it: (S, * Msb, * Mughnee:) [and
similar to these cases is the case in which it is
preceded by an interrogation: see أَمْ as syn. with
this particle:] but when it is preceded by a negation or a prohibition, it is used to confirm the
meaning of what precedes it and to assign the
contrary of that meaning to what follows it,
(Mughnee, K,) as in مَا قَامَ زَيْدٌ عَمْرٌو [Zeyd
stood not, but 'Amr stood], (Mughnee,) or مَا
رَأَيْتُ زَيْدًا بَلْ عَمْرًا, [I saw not Zeyd, but I saw
'Amr], (S,) and لَا يَقُمْ زَيْدٌ بَلْ عَمْرٌو [Let not
Zeyd stand, but let 'Amr stand]. (Mughnee.)
Mbr and 'Abd-El-Wárith allow its being used to
transfer the meaning of the negation and the prohibition to what follows it; so that, accord. to
them, one may say, مَازَيْدٌ قَائِمًا بَلْ قَاعِدًا [as
meaning Zeyd is not standing: no, is not sitting],
and بَلْ قَاعِدٌ [but is sitting]; the meaning being
different [in the two cases]. (Mughnee, K. *)
The Koofees disallow its being used as a conjunction after anything but a negation [so in the
Mughnee, but in the K a prohibition,] or the like
thereof; so that one should not say, ضَرَبْتُ زَيْدًا
بَلْ إِيَّاكَ [I beat Zeyd: no, thee]. (Mughnee,
K.) Sometimes لَا is added before it, to corroborate the meaning of digression, after an affirmation,
as in the saying,
وَجْهُكَ البَدْرُ لَا بَلِ الشَّمْسُ لَوْ لَمْ
يُقْضَ لِلشَّمْسِ كَسْفَةٌ وَ أُفُولُ
[Thy face is the full moon: no, but it would be
the sun, were it not that eclipse and setting are
appointed to happen to the sun]: and to corroborate what precedes it, after a negation, as in
وَ مَا هَجَرْتُكَ لَا بَلْ زَادَنِى شَغَفًا
هَجْرٌ وَ بَعْدٌ تَرَاخَى لَا إِلَى أَجَلِ
[And I did not abandon thee, or have not abandoned thee: no, but abandonment and distance,
protracted, not to an appointed period, increased,
or have increased, my heart-felt love]. (Mughnee,
K. *) ―
-b2-  Sometimes it is used to denote the passing
from one subject to another without cancelling
[what precedes it], and is syn. with وَ, as in the
saying in the Kur [lxxxv. 20 and 21], وَاللّٰهُ مِنْ,
وَ رَائِهِمْ مُحِيطٌ بَلْ هُوَ قُرْآنٌ مَجِيدٌ [And God from
behind them is encompassing: and it is a glorious
Kur-án: or here it may mean إِنَّ, as in an ex.
below]: and to this meaning it is made to accord
in the saying, لَهُ عَلَىَّ دِينَارٌ بَلْ دِرْهَمٌ [I owe him
a deenár and a dirhem]. (Msb.) ―
-b3-  In the fol-
lowing saying in the Kur [xxxviii. 1],وَالْقُرْآنِ ذِى
الذِّكْرِبَلِ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا فِى عِزَّةٍ وَشِقَاقٍ, it is said
to signify إِنَّ; [so that the meaning is, By the
Kur-án possessed of eminence, verily they who
have disbelieved are in a state of pride and opposition;] therefore the oath applies to it. (Akh,
S.) ―
-b4-  Sometimes the Arabs use it in breaking off
a saying and commencing another; and thus a
man commences with it a citation, or recitation,
of verse; in which case, it does not form any part
of the first verse, but is a sign of the breaking off,
or ending, of what precedes. (Akh, S.) ―
-b5-  Sometimes it is put in the place of رُبَّ, (S, Mughnee,)
as in the saying of the rájiz,
بَلْ مَهْمَهٍ قَطَعْتُ بَعْدَ مَهْمَهٍ
[Many a far-extending desert have I traversed,
after a far-extending desert]. (S: [and a similar
ex. is given in the Mughnee.]) ―
-b6-  What is deficient in this word [supposing it to be originally
of three letters] is unknown; and so in the cases
of هَلْ and قَدْ: it may be a final و or ى or
they may be originally بَلّ and هَلّ and قَدّ.
(Akh, S.)
[
بَلٌّ Moist, or containing moisture: or rather
moistened; being, app., an inf. n. used in the
sense of a pass. part. n. ; like خَلْقٌ in the sense
of مَخْلُوقٌ. Hence,] رِيحٌ بَلَّةٌ and ↓بَلِيلٌ and
↓بَلِيلَةٌ A wind in which is moisture: (S:) or
the last, a wind mixed with feeble rain: (T:)
and the second, a wind cold with moisture; (M,
K;) or the same, a wind cold with rain; (A,
TA;) the north wind, as though it sprinkled
water by reason of its coldness: (TA:) and
↓ بَلَلٌ also signifies a cold north wind: (Ibn-
'Abbád, TA:) بَلِيلٌ is used alike as sing. and
pl. : (K:) it has no pl. (M.)

let alone, or done, or made use of, or possessed:
(T, S, M, K:) so in the dial. of Himyer: (T, S.
M:) or a remedy; (A'Obeyd, T, S, M, K;) from
the phrase بَلَّ مِنْ مَرَضِهِ [q. v.]: (A' Obeyd, T, S,
M:) or it is an imitative sequent to حِلٌّ, (M, K,)
as some say: (M:) so As thought until he heard
that it was said to be of the dial. of Himyer in
the first of the senses explained above: (S, M:)
A'Obeyd and ISk say that it may not be so
because it is conjoined with حِلٌّ by وَ: (T:) and
A'Obeyd says, We have seldom found an imitative sequent conjoined by و. (TA.) Hence the
phrase, هُوَ لَكَ حِلٌّ وَبِلٌّ It is to thee lawful and
allowable: or lawful and a remedy. (M, K. *)
And hence the saying of El-'Abbás the son
of 'Abd-El-Muttalib, respecting [the well of]

lawful &c. (T, S, M.)
