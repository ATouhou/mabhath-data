بَسْقَةٌ A [ stony tract such as is termed] حَرَّة:
[or one that is somewhat elevated; as also بَصْقَةٌ:]
pl. بِسَاقٌ. (K.)
بُسَاقٌ i. q. بُصَاقٌ[Spittle, or saliva, when it has
gone forth from the mouth: or saliva that flows;
see بُزَاقٌ: see also 1]. (S, K.) [بُسَاقَةٌ is app. its
n. un. And hence,] ―
-b2- بُسَاقَةٌ القَمَرِ Stone of a
clear white colour, that glistens;  as also with
ص. (TA.)
بَسُوقٌ and ↓مِبْسَاقٌ, both applied to a ewe,
(JK, K,) and to a she-camel, (TA,) Having a
long udder: (JK, K:) or i. q. ↓, applied to
a ewe. (JK.)
بَاسِقٌ [act. part. n. of 1]. نَخْلَةٌ بَاسِقَةٌ A tall
palm-tree: [or an exceedingly tall palm-tree; see
1:] pl. بَاسِقَاتٌ and بَوَاسِقُ. (Msb.) The former
of these pls. occurs in the Kur l. 10, meaning
tall: (S, Bd, TA:) or bearing fruit; from أَبْسَقَتْ
said of a ewe, as signifying “she was, or became, pregnant;” so that it is an instance of
a part. n. of the measure فَاعِلٌ from a verb of
the measure أَفْعَلَ: accord. to one reading, it is
بَاصِقَات, because of the ق. (Bd.) The latter of
the pls. also signifies The first portions of clouds:
(AHn, TA:) [app. the portions that first appear
above the horizon:] or what are elongated of the
heads, or summits, (فُرُوع,) of a cloud: and hence,
of [the plant called] أُقْحُوَان [or chamomile].

white colour [as being always very high in the
sky]. (Sgh, K. *) ―

مُبْسِقٌ A she-camel excerning the first milk, or
biestings, into her udder before bringing forth:
(As, S, K: [see 4:] and see also بَسُوقٌ:) pl.

having milk flowing into her breast. (TA.)
