بخس1
بَخَسَهُ, aor.
بَخَسَ, inf. n. بَخْسٌ, He diminished
it; lessened it; made it deficient, or defective:
(S, A, Msb, K:) or he made it faulty. (Msb.)
You say, بَخَسَ الكَيَّالُ [for بَخَسَ الكَيَّالُ الكَيْلَ
The measurer made defective measure]. (A.)
And of a just sale, لَا بَخْسَ فِيهِ وَ لَا شَطَطَ, (S,) or
وَلَا شُطُوطَ, (T, TA,) [There is no deficiency in it
nor excess.] And it is said in the Kur [lxxii. 13],
فَلَا يَخَافُ بَخْسًا وَلَا رَهَقًا He shall not fear diminution of the reward of his actions, nor wrong, or
injustice. (TA.) And in this sense, [as also in
the next,] the verb is doubly trans. (Msb.) You
say, بَخَسَهُ حَقَّهُ He diminished to him his right,
or due; deprived him, or defrauded him, of a
part of it. (S, A.) And it is said in the Kur
[vii. 83 and xi. 86 and xxvi. 183], وَلَا تَبْخَسُوا
النَّاسَ أَشْيَآءَهُمْ [And ye shall not diminish unto
men their things]: (Msb:) or the verb in this
instance has the signification next following.
(TA.) ―
-b2-  He wronged him; acted wrongfully,
or unjustly, towards him. (A, K.)
-A2-  بَخَسَ
عَيْنَهُ: see بَخَصَ.

تباخسوا They defrauded one another in a
sale. (K.)
بَخْسٌ Deficient; defective. (S.) It is said in
the Kur [xii. 20], وَشَرَوْهُ بِثَمَنٍ بَخْسٍ And they
sold him for a deficient, or defective, price: (S, *
Msb, * TA:) or for a price less than was incumbent: or for an insufficient price: or for an
unjust price; accord. to Zj; because the sale of a
man that has been found is unlawful. (TA.)
-A2-
Land that produces herbage without being [artificially] watered: (JK, S, K:) or land which is
watered by the rain; because it has deficient
watering: (Mgh:) pl. بُخُوسٌ. (JK, TA.) ―
-b2-
Also, (TA, as from Ibn-Málik,) or ↓ بَخْسِىٌّ,
[which is more probably the correct form,] a
rel. n. from بَخْسٌ in the sense immediately preceding, explained in the T as signifying, (Mgh,)
Seed-produce that is not irrigated with water
from a spring or well or the like, but only by the
rain. (Mgh, and TA from Ibn-Málik.)
بَخْسِىٌّ: see بَخْسٌ.
بَاخِسٌ Any one who acts wrongfully, or unjustly. (TA.) It is said in a prov., تَحْسِبُهَا حَمْقَآءَ
وَ هِىَ بَاخِسٌ; (S, A, K;) so runs the prov.; but
accord. to Th, (S,) you may also say بَاخِسَةٌ; (S,
K;) i. e., [Thou thinkest her stupid,] but she is
wrongful, or unjust: applied to him who feigns
himself to be of weak understanding when he is
crafty and cunning. (K, TA.) The origin of the
prov. was this: a man of the Benu-l-' Ambar,
of Temeem, mixed his property with that of a
woman, coveting the possession of it, and thinking
that she was stupid, and that she did not take
care of her property nor know it: then he made
a division with her, after he had mixed; but she
was not content with the division until she took
her property: she complained of him to those in
authority, so that he released himself from her by
giving her what she desired of the property: and
the man was reproved for his conduct; it being
said to him, “Thou cheatest a woman: is not this
wrongful conduct (بَخْس)? ” whereupon he replied
in the words above, which became a proverb.
(Th, K, * TA.)
