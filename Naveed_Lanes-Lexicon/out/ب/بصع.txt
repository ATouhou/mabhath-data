بصع1
بَصَعَ, aor.
بَصَعَ, (K,) inf. n. بَصْعٌ, (S,) He collected: (K:) [J says,] I have heard from certain
of the grammarians that البَصْعُ is syn. with الجَمْعُ,
but I know not what is the truth of the matter.
(S.) Hence what here follows. (TA.)
أَبْصَعُ is a word used as a corroborative, and is
pronounced by some with the pointed ض, but
this is not of high authority: you say, أَخَذْتُ حَقِّى
أَجْمَعَ أَبْصَعَ [I took my right, or due, altogether]:
and [the pl. is أَبْصَعُونَ:] you say, جَآءَ القَوْمُ
أَجْمَعُونَ أَبْصَعُونَ [The people, or company of men,
came all together]: and the fem. is بَصْعَآءُ: you
say, جَمْعَآءَ بَصْعَآءَ: and [the pl. of بَصْعَآءُ is بُصَعُ:
you say,] رَأَيْتُ النِّسْوَةَ جُمَعَ بُصَعَ [I saw the women
all together]: it is a corroborative occurring in a
particular order, never before اجمع. (S.) [See
أَبْتَعُ.]
