بَدَأَ بِهِ, (T, S, M, &c.,) aor.
بَدَاَ, (Mgh, K,)
inf. n. بَدْءٌ, (T, S, M, Msb,) i. q. به ↓ ابتدأ; (S,
Msb, K;) [He began with it;] he made it to
have precedence, or to be first; gave precedence
to it; syn. قَدَّمَهُ: (Mgh, Msb:) in the dial. of
the Ansár, بَدِئَ به is used in this sense of قدّمه;
(M;) or بَدِىَ به [without ء]; (IKtt, TA; [see
بَدةءٌ;]) [and بَدَى به; see art. بدى;] and به ↓ ابدأ
signifies the same. (Msb.) [So in the Kur xii. 76,
فَبَدَأَ بِأَوْعِيَتِهِمْ قَبْلَ وِعَآءِ أَخِيهِ And he began with
their bags, before the bags of his brother. And
بَدَأَهُ is sometimes used in the sense of بَدَأَ بِهِ;
whence, in the Kur ix. 13, وَهُمْ بَدَؤُوكُمْ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ
And they, it was, began with you the first time;
i. e., as Bd says, by acting with hostility, and
fighting.] You say also, بَدَّا ثُمَّ عَادَ He began, or
did a first time, or the first time: then repeated,
or did a second time. (Az, TA in art. عود.) And
بَدَأَ فِىِ الأَمْرِ [He began, or made a beginning, in
the affair.] (M.) ―
-b2-  بَدَأَ also signifies It (a thing)
began; began to be; originated; or came into
existence. (Msb.) [See also 5.]
-A2-  بَدَأَ الشَّيْءَ,
(S, M, K,) aor. and inf. n. as above, (M,) [He
began the thing; commenced it; set about it; as
also ↓ ابتدأهُ: accord. to the Mgh, the latter has
this meaning, or, agreeably with the authority of
the M and K, the meaning which here next
follows:] he did the thing first, for the first time,
by way of beginning, or originally; (S, M, K;)
as also ↓ ابدأهُ and ↓ ابتدأهُ; (M, K;) i. e., not
after the example of anything preceding. (TA.
[But this addition seems rather to belong to another explanation to be mentioned below.]) One
does not say, زَيْدًا ↓ ابتدأ nor بَدَأَهُ, because these
two verbs [signifying as last explained above]
do not have for their objects corporeal things.
(Mgh.) [El-Mutanakhkhil El-Hudhalee uses the
phrase سَأَبْدُؤُهُمْ بِمَشْمَعِةٍ I will begin with them
(meaning his guests) by sporting and jesting;
like the phrase in the Kur ix. 13 cited above:
but different from these is the saying in the Kur
xxxii. 6, وَبَدَأَ خَلْقِ الْإِنْسَانِ مِنْ طِينٍ And He
began the creation of man from clay.] The
saying, ↓ فَإِنْ كَانَ السَّبُعُ ابْتَدَأَهُ means ابتدأ أَخْذَهُ
أَوْ عَضَّهُ [But if the beast, or bird, of prey has
begun the seizing of him, or the biting of him];
the noun that is prefixed [to the pronoun] being
suppressed. (Mgh.) You say also, كَانَ ذٰلِكَ فِى
الأَمْرِ ↓ ابْتِدَآءِ That was in the beginning, or first,
of the affair. (Msb.) [See also بَدْءٌ, below.] ―
-b2-
He originated the thing; brought it into being
or existence; made it, or produced it, for the
first time, it not having been before; (Mgh;)
[and] so ↓ ابدأهُ, said [of God, and] of a man, as
the agent; (Msb;) and ↓ ابتدأهُ. (Mgh in art.
بدع.) [Hence,] بَدَأَ اللّٰهُ الخَلْقَ, and ↓ أَبْدَأَهُمْ, God
created, or brought into existence, mankind, or
the created beings: (M, Msb, K:) both signify
the same. (S.) البَاطِلُ وَمَا يُعِيدُ ↓ مَا يُبْدِئُ [in
the Kur xxxiv. 48, means What doth that which
is false, or the Devil, originate, or produce in the
first instance? and what doth it, or he, reproduce
after it hath perished?]: Zj says that مَا, here, is
in the place of an accus., meaning in each Instance
أَىَّ شَىْءٍ: or it may be a negative; and الباطل
here is Iblees; i. e., Iblees createth not, nor
raiseth to life after death. (M.) You say also,
وَمَا يُعِيدُ ↓ مَا يُبْدِئُ, meaning وَلَا ↓ مَا يَتَكَلَّمُ
عَائِدَةٍ, (S, K,) i. e. He does not say anything for
the first time, nor anything for the second time;
or anything original, nor anything in the way of
repetition; الكَلَامِ ↓ بَادِئَةُ signifying what is said
for the first time; and عَائِدَةُ الكَلَامِ, what is said
for the second time, afterwards: (TA:) or he
says not anything: (A in art. عود:) and he has
no art, artifice, or cunning. (IAar, TA in art.
عود; and A in the present art.) ―
-b3-  بَدَأَ البِئْرَ He
dug the well [for the first time: see بَدِىْءٌ].
(Msb.)
-A3-  بَدَأَ مِنْ أَرْضٍ إِلَى أَرْضٍ, (T,) or مِنْ أَرْضِهِ,
(K,) He went forth from a land to a land, or
from his land; as also ↓ ابدأ. (T, K.)
-A4-  بُدِئَ,
(inf. n. as above, S, M, K,) He (a man, S, M)
had the small-pox: (AZ, As, T, S, M, K:) or the
حَصْبَة [i. e. measles, or spotted fever]: (S, M, K:)
or, as AZ says, and the حصبة: (T:) or, as Lh
says, there came forth upon him pustules resembling the small-pox: but he adds, some say, the
small-pox itself: (M:) the epithet applied to a
person affected therewith is ↓ مَبْدُوْءٌ. (AZ, As,
Lh, T, S, M.) ―
-b2-  Also He fell sick. (IAth, TA.)
In a trad. of ' Áïsheh occur the words, فِى اليَوْمِ
الَّذِى بُدِئَ فِيهِ رَسُولِ اللّٰهِ [meaning In the day in
which the Apostle of God fell sick]: and IAth
says, مَتَى بُدِئَ فُلَانٌ meaning When did such a
one fall sick? is a phrase used in inquiring
respecting the living [who has been attacked by
illness] and respecting the dead. (TA.)

-b2-  Also He
did a new thing; a thing unknown before; or a
strange, or wonderful, thing. (S, * TA.) ―

syn. نَجَا; [as also أَبْدَى;] said of a man. (M.)
―
-b4-  And He put forth his second teeth; said of a
child; (M;) and of a colt. (TA voce أَحْفَرَ, q. v.)

تبدّأ He, or it, began, or made a beginning.
(KL.) [See also 1. Golius mentions, but without
giving the authority, and without the vowel-signs,
the saying, هَاتِ القِصَّةَ مِنْ ذِى تُبُدِّئَتْ; but writing
the last word تبديت, stating only that it is in the
passive form; as meaning Relate thou the story,
or history, from the beginning.]

-b2-  ابتدأهُ بِوَعْدٍ He
made him a promise in anticipation; without his
asking it of him. (M in art. انف.)
بَدءٌ inf.n. of 1; (T, S, M, Msb;) [The act of
beginning;] or the doing a thing first. (M.) You
say, لَكَ البَدْءُ, (M, K,) and ↓ البُدْءُ, (As, TA,) and
↓ البَدْأَةُ, (S, M, Msb, K,) and ↓ البُدْأَةُ, (S, M, K,)
and ↓ البِدْأَةُ, (L,) and ↓ البَدَآءَةُ, (M, K,) and
↓ البُدَآءَةُ, (S, M, K,) and البُدَاهَةُ, with ه substituted for ء, (M, Mtr,) and ↓ البِدَآءَةُ, (Mtr, TA,)
and, accord. to IKtt, البِدَايَةُ, but see what follows,
(TA,) and ↓ البَدِئَةُ, (M, K,) and ↓ البُدَّآءَةُ, (AZ,
TA,) It is for thee to begin, (S, M, Msb, K,)
before any other, in shooting or casting, &c.:
(S:) as to البِدَايَةُ, mentioned above, accord. to
Mtr [and Fei], (TA,) it is a vulgar word, (Mgh,
Msb, TA,) as IB and several others have stated,
(Msb, TA, *) a corruption of ↓ البِدَآءَةُ, (Mgh,
Msb,) signifying the first; as also ↓ البُدَآءَةُ; and
↓ البَدْأَةُ: (Msb:) but IKtt says that it is a word
of the dial. of the Ansár; بَدَأْتُ بِالشَّىْءِ and بَدِيتُ
بِهِ signifying قَدَّمْتُهُ: [see 1:] and he cites the
following verse of Ibn-Rawáhah:
وَلَوْ عَبَدْنَا غَيْرَهُ شَقِينَا  بِاسْمِ الْإِلَاهِ وَ بِهِ بَدِينَا
[In the name of God, and with it we begin; and
if we worshipped any other than Him, we should
be miserable]: see art. بدى. (TA. [This verse
is also cited in the S in art. بدو, where, in one
copy I find it as above; in another, with بَدَيْنَا
instead of بَدِيْنَا.]) And you say, فَعَلَهُ عَوْذَا وَبَدْءًا,
(T, S,) and عَوْدَهُ عَلَي بَدْئِهِ, (M,) and فِى عَوْدِهِ
وَبَدْئِهِ, and ↓ فِى عَوْدَتِهِ وَبَدْأَتِهِ, (S, M,) [He did
it returning and beginning again; or returning
to his beginning; i. e. he did it again from the
beginning; he recommenced it: or you say this]
meaning like as is meant by the saying next following. (TA.) رَجَعَ عَوْدَهُ عَلَى بَدْئِهِ, (S, K,) and
عَوْدًا عَلَى بَدْءٍ, in both of which [and in the last
following] the verb may be trans., and the noun
following therefore in the accus. case, (TA,) and
فِى عَوْدِهِ وَبَدْئِهِ, and ↓ فِى عَوْدَتِهِ وَبَدْأَتِهِ, [in both
of which, if correct, the verb must be intrans.,]
and عَوْدًا وَبَدْءًا, [as though meaning عَائِدًا وَبَادِئًا,
used as a phrase denotative of state,] (K,) [but
in this last, and the two next preceding, accord.
to the TA, the verb should be فَعَلَهُ, as in the
next preceding sentence, instead of رَجَعَ, and this
is confirmed by what is said in the K in art. عود,]
He returned in the way whence he had come:
(S, K:) [accord. to the TA, the literal meaning
of the first and second may be he made his returning to revert to his beginning, and he made a
returning to revert to a beginning:] or the meaning of the first, (Sb, TA in art. عود, and K in
that art.,) and of the second, (K in that art.,) is,
he returned without stopping after he had gone
away: (Sb, K:) and sometimes it signifies the
stopping in one's coming and then returning:
(Sb:) [and it returned to its first state; it recommenced:] and you say, رَجَعْتُ عَوْدِى عَلَى
بَدْئِى, meaning I returned like as I had come.
(Sb ubi suprà.) ―
-b2-  Also First, or former; preceding all others, or preceding another; as also
↓ البَدْءُ بَدِىْءٌ; and البَدِىءُ being syn. with الأَوَّلُ.
(S, K.) Hence the saying, اِفْعَلْهُ بَادِى بَدْءٍ, and
↓ بَادِى بَدِىْءٍ, meaning Do thou it the first thing,
or the first of everything; [accord. to different
copies of the S;] the ى in بادى being quiescent,
in the place of the accus. case, accord. to usage;
and sometimes they omit the [altogether], on
account of frequent use [of the phrase], as will
be stated in art. بدو, (S in the present art.,) saying بَادِى بَدٍ, and بَادِىبَدِى (S in art. بدو.)
You say also, اِفْعَلْهُ بَدْءًا, and أَوَّلَ بَدْءٍ, (Th, M,
K,) and بَدْءَ بَدْءٍ, (CK,) and بَدَا بَدْءٍ, (M, K,)
and بَدْءٍ ↓ بَادِئَ, (A'Obeyd, T, S, M, K,) and
بَادِىَ بَدٍ, (K,) and بَادِىْ بَدًا, (M, K, [in the CK
بَادِىْ بَدٍ,]) and بَادِىْ بَدًا, (M,) and بَدِىْءٍ ↓ بَادَئَ,
(K,) and بَادِىْ بَدَا, (M, K,) and ↓ بَدِىْءٍ ↓ بَادِئَ,
(A'Obeyd, T, S, M, CK,) and بَدِىٍّ ↓ بَادِئَ, which
is anomalous, (M,) or بَادِىَ بَدِّىِ, (K,) and بَادِىْ
بَدِيٍّ, (Fr, A'Obeyd, T, S, M,) and ↓ بَدِئٍ ↓ بَادِئَ,
(S, CK,) or ↓ بَادِىَ بَدِئٍ, (K, TA,) and بَادِىْ
↓ بَدْأَةَ, (M, K, TA,) the former word being the
act. part. n. of بَدِىَ, which is of the dial. of the
Ansár, as mentioned above, and the latter being
indecl., with fet-h for its termination, (TA, [in
the CK the latter word is written بَدْءَة,]) and
بَدْءٍ ↓ بَدْأَةَ, (CK,) and ↓ بَدْأَةَ بَدْأَةَ, (M, K,) and
↓ بَدِىْءٍ ↓ بَدْأَةَ, (S,) and بَدْءٍ ↓ بَدِىْءَ, (S, CK,) and
بَدْءَ ذِى بَدْءٍ, (Fr, T,) and ذِى بَدْءٍ ↓ بَدْأَةَ, (Fr, T,
S, K,) and ↓ بَدْأَةَ ذِى بَدْأَةٍ, and ↓ ذِى بَدِىْءٍ ↓ بَدْأَةَ,
(S, K,) and ↓ ذِي بَدَآءَةَ ↓ بَدَأَةَ, (K, TA,) not بداءة
[as in the CK], (TA,) and ↓ بَدِىْءَ ذِى بَدِىْءٍ, (S,
K, TA, [in the CK the last word is written بَدْءٍ,])
and ↓ ذِى بَدِىْءٍ ↓ بَدَآءَةِ, (K,) meaning Do thou
it the first thing; (Fr, T, K;) so in a correct
copy [of the K, and so I find in a MS. copy of
the K and in the CK]: accord. to another copy,
the first of everything: (TA:) or the first of
first; (S;) thus in the L: (TA:) the words
here put in the accus. case [literally or virtually]
are so put [in some instances] as adverbial nouns;
or, accord. to MF, they may be [in some instances]
denotatives of state, with respect to the agent;
the meaning being اِفْعَلْهُ حَالَةَ كَوْنِكَ بَادِئًا, i. e.
مُبْتَدِئَا بِهِ [lit. do thou it in the state of thy being
beginning it]. (TA.) [In like manner,] you also
say, بَدْءَ الرَّأْىِ, and [more commonly] الرَّأْىِ ↓ بَادِئَ,
At first thought; or on the first opinion: (Lh,
M:) [بَدْءُ الرَّأْىِ and] الرَّأْىِ ↓ بَادِئُ signifying the
first, and beginning, of the idea, thought, opinion,
or judgment; or what is perceived before considering well or thoroughly: (M:) [and بَدْءٌ alone
signifying a first idea, thought, opinion, or judgment; as is implied in the A, voce صَيُّورٌ, q. v.:]
hence, الرَّأْيِ ↓ فَعَلَهُ فِى بَادِئِ [He did it at first
thought, &c.]: (M:) and الرَّأْىِ تُرِيدُ ↓ أَنْتَ بَادِئَ
ظُلْمَنَا, and الرأى ↓ مُبْتَدَأَ, i.e. Thou at first
thought, &c., desirest to wrong us: and one says
also, بَادِىَ الرأى, without; meaning on the occasion of what appeared of opinion; i. e. at the
first of what appeared thereof; [or at the first
opinion's presenting itself;;] in which case, the
phrase does not belong to this art. [but to art.
بدو]: it occurs in the Kur xi. 29: (M:) AA
alone there read بَادِئَ, with; all the other
readers pronounced it without ء (TA.) ―
-b3-  Also
A chief, or lord, (S, M, Msb, K,) who occupies
the first place in chieftainship or lordship: (S:)
or, as some say, a youth, or young man, whose
judgment, or opinion, is deemed good, and who
is consulted: (M:) or it signifies also an intelligent youth or young man: (K:) pl. بُدُوْءٌ. (M.)
A poet (namely, Ows Ibn-Maghrà Es-Saadee,
TA) says,
ثُنْيَانُنَا إِنْ أَتَاهُمْ كَانَ بَدْأَهُمُ
وَبَدْؤُهُمْ إِنْ أَتَانَا كِانَ ثُنْيَانَا

be their first chief; and their first chief, if he
came to us, would be a second chief]. (S.) ―
-b4-
Also, and ↓ بَدْأَةٌ, A share, or portion, of a
slaughtered camel: (S, K:) or the best share
or portion thereof: (T:) or the former word has
the latter signification; and the latter word, the
former signification: and the former signifies also
a bone with the meat, or flesh, that is on it: (M:)
and a joint; syn. مَفْصِلٌ; (AA, T, M;) and so
بَدًا q.v.: (AA, T:) the pl. [of pauc.] of بَدْءٌ
is أَبْدَآءٌ (S, M, K) and [of mult.] بُدُوْءٌ; (S, K;)
the former of which is the more common: (TA:)
or this is pl. of بَدًا. (AA, T.) The shares abovementioned [as commonly divided for the game
called المَيْسِر q. v.] are ten; namely, the two
haunches, the two thighs properly so called, the
two thighs commonly so called (i. e. the tibiæ),
the two shoulders, and the two arms; which
last are the worst, because of the many veins
[therein]. (TA.) ―

-b2-  Also The
beginning, or outward course, of a military expedition; opposed to رَجْعَةٌ, meaning the returning,
or homeward course, thereof: occurring in a
trad., in which it is said that the Prophet gave,
in the case of the former, a fourth [of the spoil],
and in the case of the latter, a third; i.e., when
a troop went forth from the main body of the
army and attacked a party of the enemy, they
were to have a fourth of the spoil that they took,
and the rest of the army was to share with them
the remaining three fourths; and if a troop did so
in returning, they were to have a third of all
the spoil that they took, because of the greater
difficulty and danger attending this case. (T,
Mgh.) ―

land that has no owner: (TA:) AO says, (TA,)
this epithet, and بَدِيع, are applied to a well when
thou hast dug it; but if thou findest it to have
been dug before thee, it is termed خَفِيَّة; and
thus the well of Zemzem is termed خفيّة, because
it was Ismá'eel's, and was filled up or covered
over [after his time]: (T, TA:) the term قَلِيب is
[said to be] applied to an ancient well of which
neither the owner nor the digger is known:
(TA:) it is said in a trad., that the حَرِيم of a
well such as is termed بدىء [i. e. the space surrounding it and belonging to it] is five-and-twenty
