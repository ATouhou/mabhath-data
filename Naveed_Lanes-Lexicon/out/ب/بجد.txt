بجد1
بَجَدَ بِالمَكَانِ, (S, A, L, K, *) aor.
بَجُدَ, (L,)

↓ بجّد, inf. n. تَبْجِيدٌ; (L, K;) He remained,
stayed, abode, or dwelt, (S, A, L, K,) in the
place; (S, A, L;) settled, or remained fixed, in

K,) inf. n. بُجُودٌ; and ↓ بجّدت; (L;) The camels
kept to the place of pasturing. (L, K.)
2
بَجَّدَ see 1, in two places.
بَجَدٌ A company, or an assembly, of men: and
a hundred, and more, of horses: (L, K:) on the
authority of El-Hejeree: (TA:) pl. بُجُودٌ. (L.)
بَجْدَةٌ i. q. أَصْلٌ [The root, basis, or foundation;
or the origin, or source; or the most essential
part, or very essence; of a thing]. (K.) ―
-b2-  And
[hence, app.,] The inward, or intrinsic, state or
circumstances of a case or an affair; as also
↓ بُجْدَةٌ and ↓ بُجُدَةٌ: (S, L, K:) or the true, or
real, state or circumstances thereof; the positive,
or established, truth thereof; from بَجَدَ بَالمَكَانِ.
(A.) You say, هُوَ عَالِمٌ بِبَجْدَةِ أَمْرِكَ, (S, A, L,)
and ↓ بِبُجْدَتِهِ, and ↓ بِبُجُدَتِهِ, (S, L,) He is acquainted with the inward, or intrinsic, state or
circumstances of thy case or affair: (S, L:) or,
with the true, or real, state or circumstances
thereof; with the positive, or established, truth
thereof. (A.) And عِنْدِهُ بَجْدَةُ ذٰلِكَ, (S, K,) with
fet-h, (S,) He possesses the knowledge of that.
(S, K.) And hence, (S,) هَوَ ابْنُ بَجْدَتِهَا, (S, K,)
contr. of هو ابن نجْدَتِهَا, (A in art, نجد,) or, as
in the books of proverbs, أَنَا ابْنُ بَجْدَتِهَا, the
[affixed] pronoun referring to الأَرْض [understood],
as is said by Meyd and Z, (TA,) applied to
[signify He is, or I am,] the person acquainted
with the thing; (S, L, K;) possessing, or exercising, the skill requisite for it; (S, L;) the discriminator, or discerner, thereof; (L;) and one
says likewise, هُوَ ابْنُ مَدِينَتِهَا وَابْنُ بَجْدَتِهَا: (TA:)
it is also applied to [signify he is, or I am,] the
skilful guide of the way [thereof]: (L, K:) and
hence, [accord. to some,] it is proverbially applied
to any one acquainted with an affair; skilful
therein: (TA:) and to [signify he is, or I am,]
the person who will not quit, or depart from, his
place; from the saying بَجَدَ بَالمَكَانِ: (L:) or
the person who will not depart from his saying:
(K: [there explained by the words لِمَنْ لَا يَبْرَحُ
مِنْ قَوْلِهِ: but the TA supplies some apparent
omissions in this explanation, making it to agree
with that which here immediately precedes it,
taken from the L; and adds that, in some copies
of the K, عن قوله is erroneously put for من قوله:
also, that he who remains in a place knows that
place:]) or, accord. to some, بَجْدَةٌ signifies dust,
or earth; so that أَنَا ابْنُ بَجْدَتَهَا is as though it
meant I am created of its dust, or earth. (TA.)
―
-b3-  Also A [desert, such as is termed] صَحْرِآء.
(K.) Kaab Ibn-Zuheyr uses the phrase اِبْنُ بَجْدَتَهَا
as meaning Its male chameleon; the pronoun
referring to a desert (فَلَاة) which he is describing.
(TA.) And you say of a land covered with
black locusts, أَصْبَحَتِ الأَرْضُ بَجْدَهً وَاحِدَةً [The
land became, or has become, one desert, destitute
of vegetable produce]. (L.)
بُجْدَهٌ and بُجُدَةٌ: see بَجْدَةٌ; each in two
places.
بِجَادٌ A striped garment of the kind called
كِسَآء, (S, A, L, K,) being one of the kinds of
كَسآء worn by the Arabs of the desert: (S, L:)
or, of which the wool has been spun, or twisted,
in the manner termed يَسْرَةً [app. a mistranscription for يَسْرًا (see فَتْلٌ يَسْرٌ in art. يسر)], and woven
with the instrument calledصِيصَة: pl. بُجُدٌ: a
single oblong piece thereof is called فَلِيجٌ, of
which the pl. is فُلُجٌ. (L, TA.) ―
-b2-  Also A kind
of tent, of [the soft hair called] وَبَر. (Ibn-ElKelbee, TA voce بَيْتٌ, q. v.)
بَاجِدٌ Remaining, staying, abiding, or dwelling,
in a place; (L;) settled, or remaining fixed, in
a land. (A.)
