بدو1
بَدَا, (T, S, M, &c.,) aor. يَبْدُو, (S, Msb,)
inf. n. بُدُوٌّ (S, M, Msb, K) and بَدْوٌ and بَدَآءٌ
(M, K) and بَدَآءَةٌ (K) and بَدًا, (M, on the
authority of Sb,) for which last we find, in [some
of] the copies of the K, بُدُوٌّ, a repetition, (TA,)
or بُدُوْءٌ, (so in other copies of the K,) It
appeared; it became apparent, open, manifest,
plain, or evident: (T, S, M, Msb, K:) and ↓ تبدّى
[signifies the same; or he showed himself, or it
showed itself; (see an ex. in art. جيش, voce
جَاشَ, last sentence;) or] he, or it, came in sight,
or within sight. (KL.) ―
-b2-  بَدَا لَهُ فِى الأَمْرِ, (T,
M, Msb, K, and Har p. 665,) inf. n. بَدْوٌ (M, K)
and بَدًا (M, and so in a copy of the K) and بَدَآءٌ,
(T, M, and so in the CK,) or بَدَآءَةٌ and بَدَاةٌ; (as
in some copies of the K;) or ↓ بَدَا لَهُ فِى الأَمْرِ بَدَآءٌ,
(S, IB,) the last word being in the nom. case
because it is the agent; (IB, TA;) An opinion
presented itself, or occurred, to him, or arose in
his mind, syn. نَشَأَ, (S, K, and Har ubi suprà,)
or appeared to him, (M,) [respecting the affair,
or case,] different from his first opinion, so that
it turned him therefrom: (Har ubi suprà:) or
there appeared to him, respecting the affair, or
case, what did not appear at first: (Msb:) accord. to Fr, ↓ بَدَا لِى بَدَآءٌ means another opinion
appeared to me: accord. to Az, بَدَا لِى بَدًا means
my opinion changed from what it was. (TA.)
Esh-Shemmàkh says,
لَعَلَّكَ وَ المَوْعُودُ حَقٌّ وَفَاؤُهُ
بَدَا لَكَ فِى تِلْكَ القَلُوصِ بَدَآءُ
[May-be (but it is right that the promise be fulfilled) an opinion different from thy first opinion
hath arisen in thy mind respecting that youthful
she-camel]. (M, TA.) ثُمَّ بَدَا لَهُمْ مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا رَأَوُا
الْآيَاتِ لَيَسْجُنَنَّهُ, in the Kur [xii.35], means بَدَا
وَقَالُوا لَيَسْجُنُنَّهُ ↓ لَهُمْ بَدَآءٌ, [i.e. Then an opinion
arose in their minds, after they had seen the signs
of his innocence, and they said that they should
certainly imprison him,] because ليسجننّه, being
a proposition, cannot be the agent: so says Sb.
(M.) بَدَا لِلّهِ أَنْ يَقْتُلَهُمْ, occurring in a trad.,
means (tropical:)  God determined that He would slay
them: for, as IAth says, بَدَآءٌ signifies the deeming to be right a thing that is known after its
having been not known; and this may not be
attributed to God: but as is said by Suh, in the
R, one may say, [of God,] بَدَا لَهُ أَنْ يَفْعَلَ كَذَا,
[properly signifying It occurred to him, or appeared to him, that he should do such a thing,]
as meaning (tropical:)  He desired to do such a thing; [as
also بَدَا لَهُ فِى فِعْلِ كَذَا;] and thus the phrase
in the trad., here mentioned, has been explained.
(TA.) [One says also, اِفْعَلْ كَذَا مَا بَدَا لَكَ Do
thou thus as long as it seems fit to thee: see, a
verse of El-Ahmar cited voce جَلَّ.] ―
-b3-  بَدَا القَوْمُ,
(T, S, M, K,) inf. n. بَدْوٌ, (S,) or بَدَآءٌ; (M, K;)
[the latter of which is said in the TA to be the
right;] or بَدَا إِلَى البَادِيَةِ, inf. n. بَدَاوَةٌ and بِدَاوَةٌ;
(Msb;) The people, or company of men, went
forth to the بَادِيَة [or desert]: (M, Msb, K:) or,
the former, went forth to their بَادِيَة: (S:) or
went forth from the region, or district, of towns
or villages or of cultivated land, to the pasturingplaces in the deserts: (T:) [ISd says,] بَدْوٌ may
be used as meaning بِدَاوَةٌ, which is the contr. of
حِضَارَةٌ: (M:) [J says,] بَدَاوَةٌ and بِدَاوَةٌ signify
the dwelling, or abiding, in the بَادِيَة [or desert];
the contr. of حِضَارَةٌ: but Th says, I know not
بَدَاوَةٌ, with fet-h, except on the authority of AZ
alone: (S:) As says that بداوة and حضارة are
with kesr to the ب and fet-h to the ح; but AZ
says the reverse, i. e. with fet-h to the ب and
kesr to the ح: (T:) both are also explained as
signifying the going forth to the بَادِيَة: and some
mention بُدَاوَةٌ, with damm; but this is not known:
(TA:) ↓ تبدّى like wise signifies he went forth
from the constant sources of water to the places
where herbage was to be sought [in the desert];
(T;) or he dwelt, or abode, in the بَادِيَة. (S, K.)
It is said in a trad., مَنْ بَدَا جَفَا, i. e. He who
abides in the desert becomes rude, rough, coarse,
or uncivil, like the desert-Arabs. (S.) And in
another, كَانَ يَبْدُو إِلَى هٰذِهِ التِّلَاعِ [He used to
go forth to these water-courses in the desert, or
these high grounds,  or low grounds, &c.]. (TA.)―
-b4-
[Hence,] بَدَا He voided his excrement, or ordure;
(M, K;) as also ↓ ابدى (T, K) [and ابدأ]: because
he who does so goes forth from the tents or houses
into the open country. (T.)
-A2-  بَدَانِى بِكَذَا, aor.
يَبْدُو, is like بَدَأَنِى [i. e. He began with me by
doing such a thing]. (M, TA.)
-A3-  بَدِيَتِ الأَرْضُ
The land produced, or abounded with, بَدَاة, i. e.
truffles: (K, * TA:) or had in it truffles. (TK.)

or earth. (K, * TK.)
2
بدّى, inf. n. تَبْدِيَةٌ, He showed, or made

to him. (TA.) [See بدَآءَةٌ.] ―

a horse [or beast] to the place of pasture [app.
in the بَادِيَة, or desert]. (TA, from a trad.)
3
مُبَادَاةٌ The going, or coming, out, or forth,
in the field, to encounter another in battle, or
war. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And [more commonly] The showing open enmity, or hostility, with any one: (KL,
TA:) [a meaning more fully expressed by the
phrase مُبَادَاةٌ بِالعَدَاوَةِ: for you say,] بَادَى بِالعَدَاوَةِ
He showed open enmity, or hostility, [with another;] syn. جَاهَرَ بِهَا; (S, K; *) as also ↓ تبادى:
(K:) or you say, بالعدواة ↓ تبادوا they showed
open enmity, or hostility, one with another; syn.
تَجَاهَرُوا بِهَا. (S.) You say also, بادى النَّاسَ بِأَمْرِهِ
He showed, or revealed, to the people, or to men,
his affair, or case. (TA.) [Thus, باداهُ بِالأَمْرِ
and لَهُ الأَمْرَ ↓ ابدى signify the same; i. e. He
showed, or revealed, to him the affair, or case.]
―
-b3-  And بادى بَيْنَهُمَا He measured, or compared,
them both together, each with the other. (A, TA.)
4
ابداهُ He made it apparent, open, manifest,
plain, or evident; he showed, exhibited, manifested, evinced, discovered, or revealed, it; (S,
M, Msb, K;) and it has been said [correctly, as
will be seen below,] that ابدى عَنْهُ signifies
the same. (MF, TA.) It is said in a trad.,
مَنْ يُبْدِ لَنَا صَفْحَتَهُ نَقَمَ عَلَيْهِ كِتَابُ اللّٰهِ, i. e.
(tropical:)  Whoso showeth, or revealeth, to us his deed [or
crime] which he was concealing, [the book of
God shall execute vengeance upon him, meaning]
we will inflict upon him the punishment ordained
by the book of God. (TA.) ابدى لَهُ صَفْحَتَهُ also
means (tropical:)  He showed open enmity, or hostility,
with him. (A and TA in art. صفح.) And ابدى
عَنْ قَعْرِهِ, said of water, means It showed its
bottom, by reason of its clearness. (L in art.
مكد.) See also 3. ―

K;) as also بَدْءٌ: (AA, M:) pl. أَبْدَآءٌ. (AA, M,

The first of a thing; originally [بَدْءٌ,] with
hemzeh: (Har p. 583:) and ↓ بَدِىٌّ, also, [originally بَدِىْءٌ,] signifies the first: (TA:) [and
↓ بَدٍ and ↓ بَدَا, the latter for بَدًا, are used for بَدْءٍ.
Hence,] one says, ↓ اِفْعَلْ ذٰلِكَ بَادِى بَدٍ, (S,) or
بَادِىَ بَدٍ, (M, K,) and ↓ بَادِى بَدِى, (Fr, S, M,)
or بَادِىَ بَدِى, (as in some copies of the K,) or
↓ بادى بَدِىٍ, (as in other copies of the K and in
the TA,) and ↓ بَادَىَ بَدًا, (M, K,) mentioned by
Sb, who says that it is without tenween, though
analogy does not forbid its being with tenween,
(M,) meaning Do thou that first; (S, TA;) or,
the first thing: (Fr, TA:) originally [بَادِئَ بَدْءٍ,
&c.,] with hemz. (S, K. [See بَدْءٌ.]) Hence also
the phrase, ↓ الحَمْدُلِلٰهِ بَدِيًّا [Praise be to God
in the first place]. (TA.)

بَدَاةٌ: see بَدَآءٌ: ―

بَدَوِىٌّ [Of, or belonging to, or relating to, the
بَدْو, or desert: and, used as a subst., a man, and
particularly an Arab, of the desert:] a rel. n.
from بَدْوٌ, (S, M, K,) extr. [with respect to rule],
(M, K,) for by rule it should be بَدْوِىٌّ; (ElTebreezee, TA;) or it is an irregular rel. n. from
بَادِيَةٌ: (Msb:) and ↓ بَدَاوِىٌّ and ↓ بِدَاوِىٌّ are
similar rel. ns., (M, K,) from بَدَاوَةٌ and بِدَاوَةٌ, as
syn. with بَدْوٌ and بَادِيَةٌ, agreeably with rule; or
the former of these two may be a rel. n. from
بَدْوٌ and بَادِيَةٌ, and therefore extr. [with respect
to rule]; but it is said that when a rel. n. may be
regarded as regular or irregular, it is more proper
to regard it as regular; (M;) or the former is a
rel. n. signifying of, or belonging to, or relating
to, البَدَاوَة as meaning the dwelling, or abiding, in
the desert, (S, TA,) accord. to the opinion of AZ;
and the latter is a rel. n. from البِدَاوَة accord. to
the opinion of As and others; and is held by Th
to be the chaste form: (TA:) but بَدَوِىٌّ is the
only one of these rel. ns. that is known to the
common people: (M:) it is opposed to a townsman or villager. (TA.) [The pl. is بَدَاوَى, and
vulg. بِدْوَانٌ. See also بَادٍ, often applied to a man
as syn. with بَدَوِىٌّ.]
بَدَوَاتٌ: see بَدَآءٌ, in three places.
بَدَآءٌ [An opinion that occurs to one, or arises
in the mind; and particularly one that is different
from a former opinion;] a subst. from بَدَا in the

places. One says also, ↓ هُوَ ذُو بَدَوَاتٍ He is one
who has various opinions occurring to him, or
arising in his mind, (IDrd, S, * K, * and Har
p. 665,) of which he chooses some and rejects
others: (IDrd, TA:) it is said in praise, (IDrd,
TA, and Kzz in Har ubi suprà,) and sometimes
in dispraise: (Kzz in Har ubi suprà:) بَدَوَاتٌ is
pl. of ↓ بَداةٌ, [which is therefore syn. with بَدَآءٌ,]
like as قَطَوَاتٌ is pl. of قَطَاةٌ. (IDrd, TA, and
Har ubi supra.) One says likewise ↓ أَبُو البَدَوَاتِ,
meaning The father [i. e. originator] of opinions
that present themselves to him. (IDrd, TA.) And
↓ السُّلْطَانُ ذُو عَدَوَاتٍ وَذُو بَدَوَاتٍ (S, [in which the
context indicates it to mean The Sultán is characterized by deviations from the right way:] but
accord. to SM, it is) a trad., meaning the Sultán
ceases not to have some new opinion presenting
itself to him. (TA.)

to the appearance of opinion; (Zj, S, K; *) which
may mean either insincerely or inconsiderately:
(Zj, TA:) so in the Kur xi. 29; (Zj, S;) where
only AA read it with hemz: (TA:) if with
hemz, it is from بَدَأْتُ, and means at first thought,
or on the first opinion. (S; and Lh in M, art.
بدأ: see بَدْءٌ.) For بَادِى بَدٍ, or بَادِىَ بَدٍ, and
بَادِى بَدِى, &c., see بَدْوٌ, in four places. ―

man going forth to the بَادِيَة [or desert]: (M, *

said to be بُدًى like هُدًى] and بُدَّآءٌ: (M, K:) and

cited among the exs. of the preposition بِ, p. 142,
