برذنQ. 1
بَرْذَنَ, (M, K,) inf. n. بَرْذَنَةٌ, (T,) He
(a horse) went in the manner of the بِرْذَوْن, q. v.
(T, M, K.) ―
-b2-  He (a man) was, or became, heavy,
or sluggish: whence IDrd thinks بِرْذَوْنٌ to be
derived: (M, Msb:*) but this opinion is of no
account. (M.) ―
-b3-  He was unable to reply, (T,
K,) when asked respecting a thing. (T.) ―
-b4-  He
subdued, overpowered, or overcame: (K: [expl.
by قَهَرَ and غَلَبَ; but I think that the right
reading may be قُهِرَ and غُلِبَ, meaning he was,
or became, subdued, &c.:]) said of a man. (TA.)
