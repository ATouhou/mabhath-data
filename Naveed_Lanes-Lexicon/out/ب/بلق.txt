بَلُقَ, (MSb, TA,) inf. n. بَلْقٌ, (TA,) He opened
a door wholly: (JK, S, K:) or opened it vehemently: (K:) and ↓ ابلق signifies the same. (JK,
S, K.) ―
-b2-  And [hence,] He devirginated, or defloured, a girl. (AA, K.)
-A3-  Also He shut, or
closed, a door. (IF, K.) Thus it bears two contr.

as the thighs. (K.)

بَلَقٌ and ↓ بُلْقَةٌ, (S, K,) the former an inf. n. of
بَلِقَ, (K, * TA,) Blackness and whiteness [together,
generally in horses]: (S, K:) or the extension of
whiteness in the hind legs of a horse as high as the
thighs: (ISd, K:) and the latter, any colour with
which white is mixed. (Golius on the authority
of Meyd.)
بُلْقَةٌ: see what next precedes.
بُلَيقٌ a contracted dim. of أَبْلَقُ. (TA.)
بَلُّوقٌ: see what next follows.
بَلُّوقَةٌ, (JK, S, &c.,) [said to be] like عَجُوزَةٌ,
(K,) [but this is wrong, and is probably a mistranscription, for عَجُّورَة, with teshdeed and the
unpointed ر, n. un. of عَجُّور,] and with damm,
[↓ بُلُّوقَةٌ,] (IDrd, K,) both mentioned by AA,
(TA,) but more commonly with fet-h [to the بِ],
(IDrd, TA,) A [desert such as is termed] مَفَازَة:
(AA, S, K:) or a tract of sand that gives growth
to nothing except the [plant or tree called] رُخَامَى,
(As, K, * TA,) of which the [wild] bulls are fond,
and the roots of which they dig up and eat:
(TA:) or a wide tract of fertile land in which no
one shares with thee: (Fr, TA:) or a hard place
among sands, as though it were swept, asserted
by the Arabs of the desert to be of the dwellingplaces of the Jinn: (Aboo-Kheyreh, TA:) or
a desert land, destitute of vegetable produce and
of water, or of human beings, inhabited by none
but Jinn: (TA:) or a level, soft land: (K:) or
a place in which no trees grow: (JK:) or white
places in sand, which give growth to nothing:
(ISh, TA in art. برص:) or a piece of ground
differing in colour or appearance from that which
is next to it, that produces nothing whatever: as
also ↓ بَلُّوقٌ, like تَنُّورٌ: and, with the art. ال, particularly applied to a place in the district of ElBahreyn, asserted (as IDrd says, TA) to be of
the dwelling-places of the Jinn: (K:) pl. بَلَالِيقُ;
(JK, S, K;) which is syn. with مَوَامٍ (A 'Obeyd, S)
and سَبَارِيتٌ, meaning lands wherein is nothing:
(A 'Obeyd, TA:) in poetry, بَلَالِقُ occurs as its pl.
(K, TA.)
بُلُّوقَةٌ: see what next precedes.
أَبْلَقُ, applied to a horse, fem. بَلْقَآءُ, Black and
white: (S, K:) or white in the hind legs as high
as the thighs: (ISd, K:) pl. بُلْقٌ: which is applied by Ru-beh to mountains: but the Arabs
apply the epithet ابلق to a beast of the equine
kind, and أَبْرَقُ to a mountain (TA) and to a
sheep or goat: (Lh, TA in art. برق:) the former
is also applied to a rope. (JK.) طَلَبَ الأَبْلَقَ
العَقُوقَ (which is a prov., TA) means He sought
an impossible thing; because ابلق is applied to
a male, and عقوق means pregnant: or الابلق
العقوق means the dawn; because it breaks, (lit.,
cleaves,) from عَقَّهُ signifying شَقَّهُ. (K.)
