بَطُلَ, (S, Msb,) inf. n.
بُطْلٌ and بُطُولٌ and بُطْلَانٌ, [of which the last
seems to be the most common,] (S, Msb, K, KL,
&c.,) It (a thing) was, or became, بَاطِل, as meaning contr. of حَقّ; (S;) [i. e.,] it was, or became,
false, untrue, wrong or incorrect, fictitious, spurious, unfounded, unsound, (KL,) vain, unreal,
naught, futile, worthless, useless, unprofitable,
(KL, PS,) devoid of virtue or efficacy, ineffectual, null, void, of no force, or of no account;
(Msb;) it went for nothing, as a thing of no
account, (S, Msb, K,) or as a thing that had
perished or become lost. (K.) [It is said of an
assertion or allegation and the like, and of a deed,
&c.] Hence the saying in the Kur [vii. 115],
وَ بَطَلَ مَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ [And what they were
doing became vain, or null; or went for nothing,
as a thing of no account]. (TA.) And ذَهَبَ
دَمُهُ بُطْلًا His blood went for nothing, [unretaliated, and uncompensated by a mulet,] as a
thing of no account. (S, Msb.) And بَطَلَ دَمُهُ

(a hired man, or hireling,) was, or became, idle,

or false, right or wrong, authentic or spurious,
valid or null; (TA;) he made it to go for
nothing, as a thing of no account, or as a thing
that had perished or become lost. (K.) Hence,
ابطل شَهَادَتَهُ He annulled his testimony. (TA in
art. زور.) And لِيُحِقَّ الحَقَّ وَ يُيْطِلَ البَاطِلَ, in the
Kur [viii. 8, meaning That He might establish

or because life is annulled, or made to go for

the pl. of بَاطِلٌ is بَوَاطِلُ; (Msb;) and بُطُلٌ
occurs as a pl. of the same; (Ham p. 360;) or its
pl. is أَبَاطِيلُ, contr. to analogy, (S, Msb,) as
though the sing. were إِبْطِيلٌ; (S;) or, accord.
to AHát, this is pl. of ↓ أُبْطُولَةٌ, or, as some say,
of ↓ إِبْطَالَةٌ, (Msb,) or, accord. to As and AHát
and IDrd, of both these; (TA;) and signifies false,
