when it is trans. by means of إِلَى [or بِ (the

[But it is often immediately trans. without its
denoting such effort.] One says, بادرهُ He hastened

said in a trad., بَادِرُوا بِالْأَعْمَالِ هَرَمًا [Strive ye to

to be before the orphan's attaining to full age in
expending his property]; said of a guardian; i. q.

يَكْبَرُوا, in the Kur [iv. 5], means hastening to be
before their attaining to full age in expending
their property. (Bd, * Jel.) And بادرهُ الغَايَةَ and

strove to get before him, to the goal]. (A.) And
الغَايَةَ ↓ ابتدر and إِلَى الغَايَةِ [He strove in hastening, or strove to get first, to the goal]. (Ham
p. 46.) And بَادَرَ بَعْضُهُمْ بَعْضًا إِلَى أَمْرٍ, and
أَمْرًا ↓ ابتدروا, and ↓ تبادروهُ, They vied, or strove,
one with another, in hastening to a thing, or an

(Msb,) The full moon; (M, A, Msb, K;) as
also ↓ بَادِرٌ; (L, K;) the moon in its fourteenth

night is called بدر because it hastens to rise
before the sun sets; (S, M;) and to set before
the sun rises: (TA:) or because of its fulness;
(S, TA;) as being likened to a بَدْرَة: or, as Er-Rághib thinks to be most probable, it is itself a
primitive word: (TA:) pl. بُدُورٌ. (M, A.) Hence,
لَيْلَةُ البَدْرِ [The night of the full moon; which is]
the fourteenth night [of the lunar month]. (S.)

plate; syn. طَبَقٌ: (Ibn-Wahb, K:) because resembling the full moon, being round: so Az

بَدْرَةٌ, applied to an eye (عَيْنٌ), Quick-sighted;

that sees before [the eyes of] other horses; applied
to a horse's eye: (IAar, T, M:) or sharp-sighted:
or round and large: (M:) or full like the full

is killed] while it continues sucking, its skin, if
used for milk, is called شَكْوَةٌ; and for clarified
butter, عُكَّة: when it has been weaned, its skin for
milk is called بَدْرَة; and for clarified butter, مِسْأَد:
and when it is in its second year, its skin for milk
is called وَطْب; and for clarified butter, نِحْى:
(AZ, S:) pl. (of the former, M) بِدَرٌ and بُدُورٌ:
(M, K:) the former said by El-Fárisee to be the
only instance of the kind except هِضَبٌ pl. of
هَضْبَةٌ, and بِضَعٌ pl. of بَضْعَةٌ [or this may be pl. of
بِضْعَةٌ]. (M. [But the assertion of El-Fárisee is
incorrect (see حَيْضَةٌ), unless it be meant to apply
only to sound words; and in this case, at least
one addition should be made, namely قِصَعٌ pl. of
قَصْعَةٌ.]) ―
