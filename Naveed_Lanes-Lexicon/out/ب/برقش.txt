is dust-coloured (أَغْبَرُ, as in the K, accord. to the
TA), or white (أَغَرُّ, as in some copies of the K),

that when it is roused, or provoked, it ruffles its
feathers and becomes variously changed in colour:
(Lth, K:) or a certain bird that is found in the
trees called عِضَاه, and the colour of which is
between blackness and whiteness, having six قَوَادِم

in the rump, that makes a noise with its wings
when it flies, and assumes various colours: (IKh:)
