بحثرQ. 1
بَحْثَرَ, [inf. n. بَحْثَرَةٌ,] He took, drew,
or pulled, a thing out, or forth; and uncovered
it, laid it open, or  exposed it; (Abu-l-Jarráh, S,
K;) as also بَعْثَرَ. (Abu-l-Jarráh, S.) It is said
in the Kur [c. 9], accord. to one reading, بُعْثِرَ
بُحْثِرَ مَا فِى القُبُورِ, [instead of بُعْثِرَ,] meaning
[When that which is in the graves is taken forth
and uncovered; i. e.,] when the dead are raised
to life; syn. بُعِثَ; and it is not improbable that
بَحْثَرَ may be composed of بَحَثَ and أَثَرَ [app.
a mistranscription for أَثَارَ], accord. to the opinion
of those who hold that quadriliteral and quinqueliteral words are composed of two. (TA.) ―
-b2-
He searched, or sought, for, or after, a thing
in the dust or earth, or the like; syn. بَحَثَ

but see بَعْثَرَ]. (L, K, and Bd in c. 9.) ―
-b3-  He
separated, disunited, scattered, dispersed, or dissipated, (S, K,) a thing. (S.) He scattered, or dispersed, his household goods, or his commodities,
and turned them over, one upon another; as
also بَعْثَرَ. (Fr, S.)
