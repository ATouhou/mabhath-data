بَدُنَ; (T, S, M, Msb, K;) inf. n.
بَدَانَةٌ (T, S, M, &c.,) of the former, (ISk, T, S,
&c.,) and بُدْنٌ, (T, S, M, K,) also of the former,
(ISk, T,) or of the latter, (S,) and بَدْنٌ, (M, K,)
accord. to AZ, (T,) and بَدَانٌ, (M, K,) or بُدُونٌ
is the inf. n. of the latter verb; (Msb;) said of a

بَدُنَتْ and بَدَنَتْ, said of a woman, (AZ, T, M,
K,) and of a بَدَنَة, q. v.; (Zj, T, &c.;) He, and

corpulent; (ISk, T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K;)

the former verb has this last signification, that of
fatness; and the latter verb is syn. with بَدَّنَ

بدّن, inf. n. تَبْدِينٌ, He (a man, T, S, M)
was, or became, aged, (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,)
and weak: (M, K:) or he was, or became, heavy
by reason of age; as also ↓بَدَنَ. (Ham p. 158.)
-A2-  He clad a man with a بَدَن, i. e. a دِرْع [or
coat of mail]. (K,* TA.)
بُدْنٌ [properly an inf. n.; see 1:] Fatness and
compactness;  as also ↓ بُدُنٌ. (S.) ―
-b2-  And Fat;
i. e. the substance termed شَحْمٌ. (M, TA.)
-A2-
It is also a pl. of بَدَنَةٌ: (T, S, &c.:) ―
-b2-  and of
بَادِنٌ. (M, TA.)
بَدَنٌ The body, without the head and arms
and legs; (M, Msb, K;) so says Az: (Msb:) or
the body without the arms and legs: (Mgh:) or
[the part] from the shoulder-joint to the posteriors
[inclusive]: (TA [as from the Mgh, in my copy
of which it is not found]:) or the جَسَدَ [generally
meaning the body together with the members] of
a man; (S;) often applied. to the whole of the
جَسَد; (Az, TA;) and in the Kur x. 92 it is said
to mean the body without soul: (S:) pl. أَبْدَانٌ;
(M, Msb;) whence the phrase, mentioned by Lh,
إِنَّهَا لَحَسَنَةُ الأَبْدَانِ [meaning Verily she is beautiful in respect of the body], as though the term
بَدَنٌ were applied to every portion of her. (M.)
شِرْكَةُ الأَبْدَانِ is originally شِرْكَةٌ بِالأَبْدَانِ, meaning Copartnership in bodily labours for the acquirement of gains. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  And hence, (tropical:)  The
part of a shirt, (Mgh, Msb,) and of a [garment
of the kind called] جُبَّة, (Mgh,) that lies against
the back and the belly, [i. e. the body thereof,]
without the sleeves and the دَخَارِيص [or gores with
which it is widened]: (Mgh, Msb:) pl. as above.
(Msb.) ―
-b3-  Also (assumed tropical:)  A short دِرْع [or coat of mail],
(S, M, K,) of the measure of the body: (M:) or
it is [a coat of mail] like a دِرْع, except that it is
short, only such as covers the body, with short
sleeves: (T:) or, as some say, any دِرْع: (M:)
and so it is said to mean in the Kur x. 92 by
IAar (T) and by Th; (M;) but Akh says that
this assertion is of no account: (S:) pl. as above.
(M, K.) ―
-b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  A small [garment of the kind
called] جُبَّة; as being likened to a coat of mail.
(TA.) ―
-b5-  Accord. to Kr, (M,) A limb, or member: or, specially, the limbs, or members, of a
slaughtered camel: (M, K: [in the latter of
which, the former of these two explanations is
improperly connected with the first in this paragraph by the conjunction او:]) to these he specially applies it in one instance: pl. as above.
(M.) ―
-b6-  Also An old, or aged, man: (K:) or so
رَجُلٌ بَدَنٌ. (T, S, M.) [In like manner, ↓ بَادِنٌ
and ↓ بَدِنٌ are said by Golius, as on the authority
of the S, to signify annosus et senior, applied to a
man, and also to a woman; but this explanation
is wrong; and the latter word I do not find in
any lexicon.] ―
-b7-  And An old mountain-goat:
(M, K:) or so وَعِلٌ بَدَنٌ: (S:) [in the present
day, بَدَن is applied to the wild goat of the
Arabian and Egyptian deserts and mountains;
the capra jaela of Hamilton Smith; called by
some an ibex; as is also تَيْتَل, properly ثَيْتَلٌ:]
pl. [of pauc.] أَبْدُنُ (M, K [in the CK, erroneously, أَبْدَنٌ]) and [of mult.] بُدُونٌ, which is extr.
[with respect to rule], on the authority of IAar.
(M, TA.) The rájiz says, describing a bitch (S,
M) and a mountain-goat, (M, TA,)
قَدْ قُلْتُ لَمَّا بَدَتِ العُقَابُ
وَضَمَّهَا وَالبَدَنَ الحِقَابٌ
جِدِّى لِكُلِّ عَامِلٍ ثَوَابُ
اَلرَّأْسُ وَالأَكْرُعُ وَالإِهَابُ
(S, * M, * TA,) [I had said, when El-' Ikáb appeared, and El-Hikáb comprised her and the old
mountain-goat, “Exert thyself: for every worker
there is a recompense: the head and the shanks
and the hide shall be thine”]: العقاب is the name
of a bitch, and الحقاب is a certain mountain: he
says, “Catch thou this goat, and I will make thy
recompense to be the head and the shanks and
the hide.” (TA.) [Hence Golius has been led
to mistake الحِقَاب for a signification of البَدَنُ.]
―
-b8-  (assumed tropical:)  The lineage, or parentage, of a man, and his
grounds of pretension to respect or honour. (M,
K.)
بَدِنٌ: see بَدَنٌ
بُدُنٌ: see بُدْنٌ.
-A2-  It is also a pl. of بَدَنَةٌ. (M,
K, &c.)
بَدَنَةٌ A she-camel, (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,)
and a male camel, (T, M, Mgh, K,) and a cow,
(T, S, M, Mgh, * Msb, K,) and a bull, (M, K,)
accord. to some, (Msb,) or properly the first of
these, (Mgh, Msb,) and the second, (Mgh,) but
made by the Sunneh to apply to a cow also,
(Mgh, * Msb,) that is slaughtered at Mekkeh,
(S,) or that is, (M, K,) or may be, (T,) brought
thither for sacrifice; (T, M, K;) so called because
they used to fatten them, (S,) or because of their
greatness, or bulkiness: (T, Mgh, Msb:) not
applied to a sheep or goat: (T, Msb, TA:) En-Nawawee erroneously cites the T as asserting
that it is thus applied; misled, it is said, by an
omission in his copy: (MF, TA:) pl. بَدَنَاتٌ, (T,
Mgh, Msb,) a pl. of pauc., (Mgh,) and بُدْنٌ, (T,
S, M, Msb,) or بُدُنٌ, (Mgh, K,) or both, (M,
Msb, TA,) the former being a contraction of the
latter, which seems to be pl. of بَدِينٌ: (Msb:)
one should not use بَدَنٌ as a pl. of بَدَنَةٌ; though
they used to say خَشَبٌ and أَجَمٌ &c. (M, TA.)
[
بَدَنِىٌّ Of, or relating to, the بَدَن, or body;
corporeal. ―
-b2-  See also بَادِنٌ.]
بَدِينٌ: see بَادِنٌ, in four places.
بَادِنٌ, applied to a man, Big, bulky, big-bodied,
or corpulent; (ISk, T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K;) as
also ↓ بَدِينٌ (Msb, K) and ↓ مُبَدَّنٌ (M, K) [and
↓ بَدَنِىٌّ]: and fat; as also ↓ مُبَدَّنٌ: (T, M:) or
heavy in body; heavy by reason of age: and
↓ بَدِينٌ signifies fat: (Ham p. 158:) بَادِنٌ is likewise applied to a woman, (S, M, Msb, K,) as are
also بَادِنَةٌ (M, Mgh, K) and ↓ بَدِينٌ (S, K) and
↓ مُبَدَّنَةٌ: (T, M:) the pl. is بُدَّنٌ (M, Msb, K)
and بُدْنٌ (M, TA) and بُدُنٌ; (Msb, K;) the first
of these being pl. of بَادِنٌ, (M, Msb,) and so the
second; (M;) and the third being pl. of ↓ بَدِينٌ.
(Msb.) See also بَدَنٌ.
مُبَدَّنٌ, and with ة: see بَادِنٌ, in three places.
مِبْدَانٌ That becomes fat quickly, with little
fodder [or food]. (M, K.)
