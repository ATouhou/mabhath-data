بدى1
بَدِيتُ بِالشَّىْءِ and
بَدَيْتُ بِهِ i. q. [بَدَأْتُ and]
اِبْتَدَأْتُ [I began with the thing; or made it to
have precedence, or to be first]; (M, K;) of the
dial. of the Ansár: (M:) the people of ElMedeeneh say, بَدَيْنَا, or بَدِينَا, [accord. to different
copies of the S,] in the sense of بَدَأْنَا: (S:) [the
right reading seems to be بَدَيْنَا; for] IKh says,
none says بَدَيْتُ in the sense of بَدَأْتُ, except the
Ansár: all others say, بَدِيتُ and بَدَأْتُ; when
the hemzeh is suppressed, the د is pronounced
with kesr, and therefore the hemzeh is changed
into ى. (IB, TA.) [See a verse of Ibn-Rawáhah
cited voce بَدْءٌ.]
بِدَايَةٌ, said by Mtr to be a vulgar word, and by
IB to be erroneous, but by IKtt to be of the dial.
of the Ansár: see art. بدأ [voce بَدْءٌ, second sentence, in two places]. (TA.)
