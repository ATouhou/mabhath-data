بَهَقٌ [The mild species of leprosy termed
“alphus,” or “vitiligo alba;” in Hebrew
בֹּהַק;]
a whiteness, less than what is termed بَرَصٌ, that
comes upon the external skin of a man; (JK;) a
whiteness that affects the skin, (S,) or body,
(Mgh, Msb,) differing from the colour of the
latter; (S, Msb;) not from what is termed بَرَص,
(S, Mgh,) or not بَرَص: (Msb:) and, accord. to
IF, a blackness that affects the skin; [i. e. the
species of leprosy termed “melas,” or “lepra
maculosa nigra;”] or a colour differing from
that of the skin: (Msb:) a thin whiteness
that affects the exterior of the cuticle, by reason
of a bad state of the temperament of the part,
inclining to coldness, and the predominance of the
phlegm over the blood: the black [species] thereof
alters (يُغَيِّرُ, in the CK يَعْتَرِى,) the skin to blackness, by reason of the mixing of the black bile
with the blood. (K, TA.) ―
