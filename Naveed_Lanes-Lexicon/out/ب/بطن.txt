بِطْيَةٌ, with kesr, is a word mentioned by Sb;
(K;) but ISd says, “I know not to what it is
applied, unless ↓ أَبْطَيْتُ be a dial. var. of أَبْطَأْتُ,
(K, TA,) like as اِحْبَنْطَيْتُ is of اِحْبَنْطَأْتُ; in
which case it is thence derived as meaning The
state [of being slow, &c.]; and is not to be
regarded as formed by substitution [of ى for ء],
because that would be extr.: ” so in the M:
(TA:) it is asserted, however, in the S and the
Fs and the Jámi' el-Loghah of Kz and in other
lexicons, that one should not say, ابطيت, with
ى, but ابطأت, with ء. (MF, TA.)
بَاطٍ part. n. of بَطَا, mentioned above, accord.
to Z and Meyd. (TA.)
بَاطِيَةٌ A certain vessel; (S;) a نَاجُود [or vessel
into which wine is put]; (AA, S, Mgh, K;) a
large vessel of glass, which is filled with wine,

ladle out from it [into their cups], (Az, Mgh,
TA,) and drink: (Az, TA:) [a wine-vase, of
glass or of earthenware; an amphora; an earthen
jar; now applied to a vessel of this kind into
which wine and oil &c. are put:] said to be an
arabicized word: (TA:) [J says,] “ I think it
to be arabicized: ” (S:) but accord. to Z and
Meyd, it is from 1, as mentioned above. (TA.)
