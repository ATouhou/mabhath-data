برسمQ. 1
بُرْسِمَ He (a man) was affected with the
disease termed بِرْسَام; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;) as
also بُلْسِمَ. (TA.)
بِرْسَامٌ, (in the T with fet-h, [بَرْسَامٌ,] Mgh,) A
certain malady, or disease, (S, Msb, K,) well
known, (S, Msb,) attended by delirium: (K:)
[in the present day, this term is applied to the
pleurisy, as also ذَاتُ الجَنْبِ; and so it is explained by Golius and Freytag; or, as the latter
adds, accord. to Avicenna, pleurodyne: but] in
some of the books of medicine, it is said to be
a tumour, (Msb,) or a hot tumour, (TA,) that
is incident to the septum which is between the
liver and the bowels, [app. meaning the upper
parts of the greater and lesser omentum,] and
then reaches to the brain: (Msb, TA:) also
pronounced بِلْسَامٌ: (ISk, Msb:) i. q. مُومٌ: (M,
TA:) it is an arabicized word; (IDrd, Mgh,
Msb;) or seems to be so; composed of بَرْ and
سَامْ; the former of these, in Persian, signifying
the “breast,” or “chest;” and the latter, “death”
[and “fire” and “a swelling;” of which three
meanings, the second and third are agreeable
with the two explanations of برسام given above]:
so says Az. (TA.)
بِرْسِيمٌ, with kesr, (K,) vulgarly pronounced
with fet-h to the ب, [بَرْسِيم,] (TA,) [Alexandrian trefoil or clover; trifolium Alexandrinum;
described by Forskål in his Flora Aegypt. Arab.
p. 139; the most common and the best kind of
succulent food for cattle grown in Egypt: it is
sown when the waters of the inundation are
leaving the fields; and yields three crops; the
second of which is termed رِبَّةٌ; and so is the
third; but this is generally left for seed: when
dry, it is termed دَرِيسٌ: if his words have not
been perverted by copyists, F explains it as] the
grain of the قُرْط, (حَبُّ القُرْط [but I think it
probable that this is a mistranscription, for خَيْرُ
القُرْطِ, i. e., the best of the (species of trefoil, or
clover, called) قُرْط,] resembling the رُطْبَة [or
رَطْبَة], or superior to this latter in size, or quality
(أَجَلُّ مِنْهَا): (K:) the قُرْط resembles the رُطْبَة,
[written in the TA without the vowel signs,]
but is superior to this latter in size, or quality
(اجلّ منها), and larger in the leaves, and is what
is called in Persian شَبْذَر [or شَبْدَر]: (AHn, TA:)
it is one of the best kinds of herbage for horses
and the like, which fatten upon it. (TA.)
إِبْرِيسَمٌ, (M, [and thus written in copies of the
K,]) with kesr to the ر [as well as the ء], accord.
to IAar, (M,) [and] with fet-h to the س; (K;)
or إِبْرَيْسَمٌ; (M;) and [app. إِبْرِيسُمٌ,] with damm
to the س; (K;) or it has three dial. forms;
accord. to ISk, it is ابريسِم [app. إِبْرِيسِمٌ]; others
say that it is ابريسَم [app. أَبْرَيْسَمٌ], with fet-h;
IAar says that it is إِبْرِيسَمٌ, with kesr to the ء
and the ر and with fet-h to the س, and he says
that there is not in the language an instance of
إِفْعِيلِلٌ, with kesr, but there are instances of
إِفْعِيلَلٌ, as إِهْلِيلَجٌ [q. v.] and إِبْرِيسَمٌ; (S; [but
I find that in two copies of that work, and in
the L, this passage is mutilated; for it runs thus;
“ISk says that it is إِبْرِيسَمٌ, with kesr to the ء
and ر, and with fet-h to the س,” &c.;]) or one
of its dial. forms is إِبْرِيسِمٌ, with kesr to the ء and
the ر and the س; but ISk disallows this, [or,
probably, as appears from what has been said
above, we should read here, “accord. to ISk,
but others disallow this,”] saying that there is
not in the language an instance of افعليل with
kesr to the [former] ل, but with fet-h, as إِهْلِيلَجٌ
and إطْرِيفَلٌ; and the second form is أَبْرَيْسَمٌ, with
fet-h to those three letters; and the third is
إِبْرَيْسَمٌ, with kesr to the ء, and fet-h to the ر
and the س; (Msb;) and IB [appears to indicate
the second and third of these forms, for he] says
that some pronounce ابريسم with fet-h to the
ء and the ر, and some pronounce it with kesr to
the ء, and with fet-h to the س; (TA;) Silk;
syn. حَرِيرٌ: (M, K:) or, accord. to some, specially, raw silk: (TA:) [it is said that] حرير
is the same as ابريسم: (Msb in art. حر:) or
dressed silk; syn. ابريسم مَطْبُوخ: (Mgh and
Msb in that art.:) or stuff wholly composed of
silk: or of which the woof is silk: (Mgh in that
art., from the Jema et-Tefáreek:) [and it is also
said that] قَزَّ is the same as ابريسم: (K in art.
قز:) or a kind thereof: (S in that art.:) or that
whereof ابريسم is made: (Lth, Az, Msb, TA, all
in that art.:) [medicinal properties are ascribed
to it: it is said that] it is exhilarating, warming to
the body, moderate in temperament, and strengthening to the sight when used as a collyrium:
(K:) the word is arabicized, (S, Msb, K, [but
in the last it is said, after the explanation of the
meaning, “or it is arabicized,”]) from [the Persian] ابريشم [i. e. أَبْرِيشَمْ]: (TA:) and is perfectly decl., even if used as a proper name, in the
manner of a surname, because it was arabicized
in its indeterminate state, not like إِسْحَاقُ &c.,
which were arabicized in their determinate state,
and are not used by the Arabs indeterminately.
(S.)
إِبْرِسَمِىٌّ or إِبْرَيْسَمِىٌّ [&c.] A manufacturer
[or seller] of ابريسم. (TA.)
مُبَرْسَمٌ A man affected with the disease termed
بِرْسَام; (Mgh, Msb, K;) as also مُبَلْسَمٌ. (Msb,
TA.)
