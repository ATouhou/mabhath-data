بذقبَذْقٌ: see بَيْذَقٌ, in two places.
بَاذَقٌ (Mgh, K) and ↓ بَاذِقٌ (K) [in my copy of
the Msb erroneously written باذيق] a Persian
word, arabicized; originally بَادَهْ, which signifies
Wine: (A'Obeyd, TA:) or juice of grapes cooked
in the least degree, so as to be strong (Mgh,
Msb, K) and intoxicating; an arabicized word;
(Msb;) said to have been introduced by the
Benoo-Umeiyeh, (TA,) and to have been unknown to the Prophet; (Mgh;) but there is a
trad. of I' Ab which is understood to mean that
the Prophet forbade what is thus called: (Mgh,
TA:) some assert it to mean that it existed not in
his time; (TA;) but this latter assertion is weak.
(Mgh.)
بَاذِقٌ: see above.
-A2-  It is also an imitative
sequent to حَاذِقٌ. (K.)
بَيْذَقٌ [meaning A pawn] in the game of chess
is from ↓ بَيَاذَقَةٌ; (TA;) which latter signifies
footmen, as opposed to horsemen, (AO, K, TA,)
and is an arabicized word, from the Persian,
(AO, TA,) originally پِيَادَهْ: (TA:) the pl. of
بيذق is بَيَاذِقُ; for which a poet uses بُذُوقٌ, as
though he suppressed the ى [in the sing.], making
بيذق to become ↓ بَذْقٌ: (Ibn-Buzurj, TA:) or,
accord. to El-Khárzenjee, (JK, TA,) ↓ بَذْقٌ signifies a guide in a journey; as also بَيْذَقٌ: (JK,
K, TA:) or [in the CK “and”] small and light
or active: (K, TA:) or, as in the Tekmileh,
(TA,) short and light or active: (JK, TA:) and
its pl. is بُذُوقْ. (JK, K.)
بَيَاذِقَةٌ: see بَيْذَقٌ.
