بقمبَقَّمٌ [Brazil-wood; the wood of the Braziltree, a species of Cæsalpinia;] a well-known
dye; (S, Msb;) i. q. عَنْدَمٌ; (S;) [or rather the
wood from which a well-known dye is prepared;]
the wood of a certain great tree, the leaves of
which are like those of the almond, and having a
red stem, the decoction of which is used as a dye:
it consolidates wounds, stops a flow of blood from
any member, and dries up ulcers; and its root,
or lowest part, is an instantaneous poison: (K:)
the word is said by some to be Arabic; (Msb;)
others say that it is arabicized; (S, Msb, TA;)
[perhaps from the Persian بَقَمْ, or بَكَمْ;] and
that the only other words of the same measure in
the Arabic language are proper names, and four
in number, (S TA,) or seven: (TA:) if used as
a proper name, it is imperfectly decl., because
determinate and of the measure of a verb. (S.)
