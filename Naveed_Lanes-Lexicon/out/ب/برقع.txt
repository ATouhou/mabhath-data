He assumed the guise of such as wear the بُرْقُع;

بُرْقَعٌ: see what next follows.
بُرْقُعٌ (IAar, S, Mgh, Msb, K) and ↓ بُرْقَعٌ
(IAar, S, Msb, K ,) but some disallow this latter,
(Msb,) and ↓ بُرْقُوعٌ, (IAar, S, K,) but AHát
disallows this, as well as the second, (TA,) A
thing pertaining to women and to horses or similar
beasts, (K,) or to horses or similar beasts and to
the women of the Arabs of the desert; (S;) a
thing with which a woman veils her face; (Msb;)
having in it two holes for the eyes: (Lth:) a
small piece of cloth, or rag, pierced for the eyes,
worn by horses or similar beasts and by the women
of the Arabs of the desert: (Mgh:) [or, accord.
to the general fashion of the present time, a long
strip of cotton or other cloth, black, blue, or of
some other colour, or white, concealing the whole
of the face of the woman wearing it, except the
eyes, and reaching nearly to the feet, suspended
at the top by a narrow band, or other fastening,
which passes up the middle of the forehead, and
which is sewed, as are also the two upper corners,
to a band which is tied round the head, beneath
the head-veil: (see my “ Manners and Customs
of the Modern Egyptians,” ch. i.:)] ↓ بُرْقَعَةٌ, if
correct, is a more particular term: (Mgh:) the
pl. is بَرَاقِعُ. (Lth, Msb.) [See نِقَابٌ.] ―
-b2-  [البُرْقُعُ
The curtain of the door of the Kaabeh.] ―
-b3-  See
also بِرْقِعُ.
بِرْقَعُ: see what next follows.
بِرْقَعُ, (S, K, * TA,) imperfectly decl., (S, TA,)
and ↓ بِرْقَعُ, (Fr, Az, Ibn-'Abbád,) of a rare form,
like هِجْرَع, (Fr, Az, *) or البِرْقِعُ and ↓ البُرْقُعُ, (K, *
TA,) but perhaps this last is a mistranscription,
for بِرْقَعُ, (TA,) a name of The heaven, or sky:
(Fr:) or the seventh heaven: (AAF, S, K:) or
the fourth heaven: (Lth, Az, K:) or the first
heaven; (K;) i. e. the lowest heaven: IDrd
says, so they assert; and in like manner says
IF; and he says, the ب is augmentative, the
radical letters being ر ق ع, for every heaven is
termed رَقِيعٌ, and the heavens [together] are
termed أَرْقِعَةٌ: (TA:) or the lowest heaven is
termed الرَّقِيعُ. (S, TA.) [See an ex. voce سَدِرٌ.]
بُرْقَعَةٌ: see بُرْقُعٌ.
بُرْقُوعٌ: see بُرْقُعٌ.
فَرَسٌ مُبَرْقَعٌ, (TA,) or فَرَسٌ أَغَرٌّ مُبَرْقَعٌ, (Mgh,)

or a horse having the whole of his face white.
(Mgh.) And شَاةٌ مُبَرْقَعَةٌ A sheep, or ewe, having
the head white. (S, K.)
غُرَّةٌ مُبَرْقِعَةٌ A blaze, or whiteness, on the face
of a horse, occupying the whole of his face, except
that he looks (يَنْظُرُ [for which يُنْظَرُ is erroneously
substituted in the CK]) in blackness; (S, L, K;)
[i. e.] this whiteness passing downwards to the
cheeks without reaching to the eyes. (L, TA.)
