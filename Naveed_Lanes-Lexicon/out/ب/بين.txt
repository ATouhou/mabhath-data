It (a thing) became separated, severed, disunited,
or cut off, (M, Mgh, Msb, K,) عَنِ الشَّىْءِ from
the thing. (Mgh.) And بَانَتْ, (M, K,) or بَانَتْ
بِالطَّلَاقِ, (Msb,) She (a wife) became separated by
divorce, (M, Msb, K,) عَنِ الرَّجُلِ from the man.
(M, K.) And بَانَتٌ said of a girl, [She became
separated from her parents by marriage;] she
married: (ISh, T:) as though she became at a
distance from the house of her father. (ISh, TA.)
And بَانَ, (M,) or بَانَ بِمَالٍ, aor. يَبِينُ, (T,) inf. n.
بُيُونٌ (T, M) and بَيْنٌ, (M,) He became separated
from his father, or mother, or both, by property
[which he received from him, or her, or them,]
(AZ, T, M,) to be his alone: (AZ, T:) and ElFárisee states, on the authority of AZ, that one]
says also, بَانَ عَنْهُ and بَانَهُ [the former app.
meaning he became separated thus from him, i. e.,
from his father; and the latter being syn. with
أَبَانَهُ, q. v.]. (M.) And بَانَ الخَلِيطُ, inf. n. بَيْنٌ
and بَيْنُونَةٌ, [The partner, or copartner, or sharer,

or far away, or far off. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  بَانَ, (T, S,
M, &c.,) aor. يَبِينُ, (T, Msb,) inf. n. بَيَانٌ; (T,
S, Mgh, K;) and ↓ ابان, (T, S, M, &c.,) inf. n.
إِبَانَةٌ; (T, Msb;) and ↓ بيّن, (T, S, M, &c.,)
inf. n. تَبْيِينٌ; (S;) and ↓ تبيّن; and ↓ استبان;
(T, S, M, &c.,) all signify the same; (T, M,
Msb;) i. e. It (a thing, T, S, M, Mgh, or an
affair, or a case, Msb) was, or became, [distinct,
as though separate from others; and thus,] apparent, manifest, evident, clear, plain, or perspicuous: (S, Mgh, Msb, K:) and it was, or became,
known. (K.) You say, بَانَ الحَقُّ [The truth

(Har p. 542.) And it is said in the Kur [ii. 257],
الرُّشْدُ مِنَ الغَىِّ ↓ قَدْ تَبَيَّنَ [The right belief hath
become distinguished from error]. (TA.) And
the lawyers, correctly, use the phrase, كَصَوْتٍ لَا
مِنْهُ حُرُوفٌ ↓ يَسْتَبِينُ [Like a sound whereof letters
are not distinguishable]. (Mgh.) ―
-b3-  [It seems to
be indicated in the TA that بَانَ, aor. يَبِينُ, inf. n.
بَيْنٌ and بَيْنُونَةٌ, also signifies It was, or became,
united, or connected; thus having two contr.
meanings; but I have not found the verb used in
this sense, though بَيْنٌ signifies both disunion and
union.]
-A2-  بَانَهُ, aor. يَبِينُ, inf. n. بَيْنٌ: see بَانَهُ,
aor. يَبُونُ, inf. n. بَوْنٌ, in art. بون.
-A3-  See also 2,
in two places.

بيّن, intrans., inf. n. تَبْيِينٌ: see 1, in two
places. ―

when beginning to grow forth. (K, TA.) And
بيّن القَرْنُ (tropical:)  The horn came forth. (K, TA.)
-A2-
بيّن بِنْتَهُ: see 4. ―
-b2-  بيّنهُ, (T, Msb, K,) inf. n.
تَبْيِينٌ (T, S) and ↓ تِبْيَانٌ (T, S, * K *) and تَبْيَانٌ;
(K;) the second of which three is an anomalous
inf. n., (T, S, K,) for by rule it should be of the
measure تَفْعَالٌ; (T, S;) but تَبْيَانٌ is not known
except accord. to the opinion of those who allow
the authority of analogy, which opinion is outweighed by the contrary; (TA;) and تِبْيَانٌ is
the only inf. n. of its measure except تِلْقَآءٌ, (T, S,)
accord. to the generality of the leading authorities;
but some add تِمْثَالٌ, as inf. n. of مَثَّلَ; and
El-Hareeree adds to these two, in the Durrah,
تِنْضَالٌ, as inf. n. of نَاضَلَهُ; and Esh-Shiháb
adds, in the Expos. of the Durrah, تِشْرَابٌ, as
inf. n. of شَرِبَ الخَمْرَ; asserting تَشْرَابٌ also to
have been heard, agreeably with analogy; [and
to these may be added تَبْكَآءٌ and تِمْشَآءٌ, and perhaps
some other instances of the same kind;] but some
disallow تِفْعَالٌ altogether as the measure of an
inf. n., saying that the words transmitted as instances thereof are simple substs. used as inf. ns.,
like طَعَامٌ in the place of إِطْعَامٌ; (MF, TA;)
and Sb says that تِبْيَانٌ is not an inf. n.; for,
where it so, it would be تَبْيَانٌ; but it is, from
بَيَّنْتُ, like غَارَةٌ from أَغَرْتُ; (M, TA;) [He made
it distinct, as though separate from others; and
thus,] he made it (namely, a thing, T, S, Mgh,
or an affair, or a case, Msb) apparent, manifest,
evident, clear, plain, or perspicuous; (S, Msb,
K;) as also ↓ ابانهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) inf. n.
إِبَانَةٌ; (Msb;) and ↓ تبيّنهُ; (S, * Msb, K;) and
↓ استبانهُ: (Mgh, Msb, K:) [بيّنهُ is the most
common in this sense: and often signifies he
explained it: and he proved it:] and ↓ all these
verbs signify also he made it known; he notified
it: (K:) or ↓ اِسْتَبَنْتُهُ signifies, (S,) or signifies
also, (Mgh,) I knew it, or became acquainted
with it, [or distinguished it,] (S, Mgh,) clearly,
or plainly; (Mgh;) and so ↓ تَبَيَّنْتُهُ; (S, * Mgh;)
[and بَيَّنْتُهُ, as appears from an ex. in what follows,
from a verse of En-Nábighah:] ↓ بِنْتُهُ and ↓ أَبَنْتُهُ
and ↓ اِسْتَبَنْتُهُ and بَيَّنْتُهُ all signify the same as
↓ تَبَيَّنْتُهُ [app. in all the senses of this verb]: (M:)
or, of all these verbs, ↓ بَانَ is only intrans.:
(Msb:) and ↓ اِسْتَبَنْتُهُ signifies I looked at it, or
into it, (namely, a thing,) considered it, examined
it, or studied it, repeatedly, in order that it might
become apparent, manifest, evident, clear, or plain,
to me: (T, TA:) and ↓ تبيّنهُ he looked at it, or
into it, (namely, an affair, or a case,) considered
it, examined it, or studied it, repeatedly, or deliberately, in order to know its real state by the
external signs thereof. (T.) A poet says,
وَمَا خِفْتُ حَتَّى بَيَّنَ الشِّرْبُ وَالأَذَى
↓ بقَانِئَةٍ أَنِّى مِنَ الحَىِّ أَبْيَنُ
[And I feared not until the drinking, or the time
of drinking, and molestation, made manifest, or
plainly showed, by a deep-red (sun), that I was
separated from the tribe: see قَانِئٌ]. (M.) And
it is said in the Kur [xvi. 91], وَأَنْزَلْنَا عَلَيْكَ الكِتَابَ
تِبْيَانًا لِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ [And we have sent down to thee
the Scripture to make manifest everything];
meaning, we make manifest to thee in the Scripture everything that thou and thy people require
[to know] respecting matters of religion. (T.)
See also بَيَانٌ, in the latter half of the paragraph.
En-Nábighah says,
إِلَّا الأَوَارِىَّ مَّا أُبَيِّنُهَا
[Except the places of the confinement of the
beasts: with difficulty did I distinguish them];
meaning ↓ أَتَبَيَّنُهَا. (S.) You say also, مَا ↓ تَبَيَّنَ
يَأْتِيهِ, meaning He sought, or endeavoured, to see,
or discover, what would happen to him, of good
and evil. (M in art. بصر.) [See also 5, below.]
سَبِيلَ المُجْرِمِينَ ↓ وَلِتَسْتَبِينَ, in the Kur [vi. 55],
means And that thou mayest the more consider,
or examine, repeatedly, in order that it may
become manifest to thee, the way of the sinners,
O Mohammad: (T:) or that thou mayest seek,
or endeavour, to see plainly, or clearly, &c.; syn.
وَلِتَسْتَوْضِحَ سَبِيلَهُمْ: (Bd:) but most read, وَلِيَسْتَبِينَ
سيبلُ المجرمين; the verb in this case being
intrans. (T.)
3
باينهُ, (K,) inf. n. مُبَايَنَةٌ, (S,) He separated
himself from him; or left, forsook, or abandoned,
him: (S, TA:) or he forsook, or abandoned, him,
being forsaken, or abandoned, by him; or cut
him off from friendly or loving communion or
intercourse, being so cut off by him; or cut him,
or ceased to speak to him, being in like manner
cut by him. (K.) [And It became separated
from it.]
4
ابان, intrans., inf. n. إِبَانَةٌ: see 1, in two
places.
-A2-  ابانهُ, (inf. n. as above, TA,) He separated it, severed it, disunited it, or cut it off.
(M, Msb, K, TA.) You say, ضَرَبَهُ فَأَبَانَ رَأْسَهُ
(S, K) He smote him and severed his head, مِنْ
جَسَدِهِ from his body. (S, TA.) And ابان المَرْأَةَ
He (the husband) separated the woman, or wife,
by divorce. (Msb.) And ابان بِنْتَهُ, and ↓ بيّنها,
(T, K,) inf. n. of the former as above, and of the
latter تَبْيِينٌ, (TA,) He married, or gave in
marriage, his daughter, (T, K,) and she went
to her husband: (T:) from بَيْنٌ signifying "distance:" as though he removed her to a distance
from the house, or tent, of her mother. (TA.)
And ابان ابْنَهُ بِمَالٍ, (M,) or ابانهُ أَبَوَاهُ, (T,) He
separated from himself his son, (M,) or his two
parents separated him from themselves, (T,) by
[giving him] property, (T, M,) to be his alone:
(T:) mentioned on the authority of AZ. (T, M.)
And ابان الدَّلْوَ عَنْ طِىِّ البِئْرِ He drew away the
bucket from the casing of the well, lest the latter
should lacerate the former. (M.) ―
-b2-  See also 2,
in three places. ―
-b3-  [Hence, ابان signifies also He
spoke, or wrote, perspicuously, clearly, plainly,
or distinctly, as to meaning; or, with eloquence:
from بَيَانٌ, q. v.] And ابان عَلَيْهِ He spoke perspicuously, clearly, plainly, or distinctly, and
gave his testimony, or evidence, or gave decisive
information, against him, or respecting it. (TA.)
[The verb thus used is for ابان كَلَامَهُ, and شَهَادَتَهُ.]
One says of a drunken man, مَا يُبِينُ كَلَامًا He
does not speak plainly, or distinctly; lit., does
not make speech plain, or distinct. (Ks, T in
art. بت.) ―
-b4-  [مَا أَبْيَنَهُ How distinct, apparent,
manifest, evident, clear, or plain, is it! See
an ex. voce بَسُلَ. ―
-b5-  And How perspicuous, or
chaste, or eloquent, is he in speech, or writing!
how good is his بَيَان!]
5
تبيّن, intrans.: see 1, in two places.
-A2-  As a
trans. verb: see 2, in seven places. ―
-b2-  [Hence,
الأَمْرَ being understood,] He sought, or sought
leisurely or repeatedly, to obtain knowledge [of
the thing], until he knew [it]; he examined,
scrutinized, or investigated: (Bd in xlix. 6:) he
sought, or endeavoured, to make the affair, or
case, manifest, and to settle it, or establish it, and
was not hasty therein: (Idem in iv. 96:) or he
acted, or proceeded, deliberately, or leisurely, in
the affair, or case; not hastily: (Ks, TA:) or it
has a signification like this: in the Kur ch. iv. v. 96
and ch. xlix. v. 6, some read فَتَبَيَّنُوا, and others
فَتَثَبَّتُوا; and the meanings are nearly the same:
التَّبَيُّنُ was said by Mohammad to be from God,
and العَجَلَةٌ [i. e. "haste"] from the devil. (T.)
6
تباينا They two (namely, two men, and two
copartners,) became separated, each from the
other: (M, TA:) or they forsook, or abandoned,
each other; or cut each other off from friendly
or loving communion or intercourse; or cut, or
ceased to speak to, each other. (K.) And تباينوا
They, having been together, became separated:
(Msb:) or they forsook, or abandoned, one another;
or cut one another off from friendly or loving
communion or intercourse; or cut, or ceased to
speak to, one another. (S.) ―
-b2-  [Hence, They two
were dissimilar: and they two (namely, words,)
were disparate; whether contraries or not: and
they two (namely, numbers,) were incommensurable.]
10
استبان, intrans.: see 1.
-A2-  As a trans. verb:
see 2, in six places.
بَانٌ a coll. gen. n.: n. un. with ة: see art. بون.
بَيْنٌ has two contr. significations; (T, S, Msb;)
one of which is Separation, or disunion [of companions or friends or lovers]. (T, S, M, Msb, K.)
Hence, ذَاتُ البَيْنِ as meaning Enmity, and vehement hatred: and the saying لِإِصْلَاحِ ذَاتِ البَيْنِ,
i. e. For the reforming, or amending, of the bad,
or corrupt, state subsisting between the people, or
company of men; meaning for the allaying of the
discord, enmity, rancour, or vehement hatred:
(Msb:) [but this has also the contr. meaning, as
will be seen below: and it is explained as having
a vague import; for it is said that] فِى إِصْلَاحِ ذَاتِ
البَيْنِ means In the reforming, or amending, of
the circumstances subsisting between the persons to
whom it relates, by frequent attention thereto.
(Mgh.) [Hence also,] غُرَابُ البَيْنِ [The raven of
separation or disunion; i. e., whose appearance,
or croak, is ominous of separation: said by some
to be] the غراب termed أَبْقَعُ [i. e. in which is
blackness and whiteness; or having whiteness in
the breast]; (S, K;) so described by the poet
'Antarah: (S:) or that which is red in the beak
and legs; but the black is called الحَاتِمُ, because
it makes [or shows] separation to be absolutely
unavoidable, (Abu-1-Ghowth, S, K,) according to
the assertion of the Arabs, i. e., by its croak:
(Msb in art. حتم:) [or it is any species of the
corvus:] Hamzeh says, in his Proverbs, that this
name attaches to the غراب because, when the
people of an abode go away to seek after herbage,
it alights in the place of their tents, searching the
sweepings: (Har p. 308:) but accord. to the
Kádee of Granada, Aboo-'Abd-Allah Esh-Shereef,
this appellation, so often occurring in poetry,
properly signifies camels that transport people
from one district, or country, to another; and
he cites the following verses:
غَلِطَ الَّذِينَ رَأَيْتُهُمْ بِجَهَالَةٍ
يَلْحَوْنَ كُلُّهُمُ غُرَابًا يَنْعَقُ
مَا الذَّنْبُ إِلَّا لِلْأَبَاعِرِ إِنَّهَا
مِمَّا يُشَتِّتُ جَمْعَهُمْ وَيُقَرِّقُ
إِنَّ الغُرَابَ بِيُمْنِهِ تُدْنُو النَّوَى
وَتُشَتِّتُ الشَّمْلَ الجَمِيعَ الأَيْنُقُ
[Those have erred whom I have seen, with ignorance, all of them blaming a raven croaking:
the fault is not imputable save to the camels; for
they are of the things that scatter and disperse
their congregation: verily the place that is the
object of a journey is brought near by the raven's
lucky omen; but the she-camels discompose the
united state]: and Ibn-'Abd-Rabbih says,
زَعَقَ الغُرَابُ فَقُلْتُ أَكْذَبُ طَائِرٍ
إِن لَّمْ يُصَدِّقْهُ رُغَآءُ بَعِيرِ
[The raven cried; and I said, A most lying bird,
if the grumbling cry of a camel on the occasion
of his being laden do not verify it]. (TA in art.
غرب.) ―
-b2-  Also Distance, (S, M, Msb, K,) by the
space, or interval, between two things. (Msb.)
You say, بَيْنَ البَلَدَيْنِ بَيْنٌ Between the two countries, or towns, &c., is a distance, of space, or
interval: (Msb:) and بَيْنَهُمَا بَيْنٌ Between them
two is a distance, with ى when corporeal distance is meant: (Idem in art. بون:) or إِنَّ بَيْنَهُمَا
لَبَيْنٌ [Verily between them two is a distance], not
otherwise, in the case of [literal] distance. (S.)
And you say also, بَيْنَهُمَا بَيْنٌ بَعِيدٌ (T in art. بون,
S, M *) and بَوْنٌ بَعِيدٌ (T in art. بون, S, M, * Msb *
in art. بون) Between them two [meaning two
men] is a [wide] distance; (M;) i. e. between
their two degrees of rank or dignity, or between
the estimations in which they are commonly held:
(Msb in art. بون:) in this case, the latter is the
more chaste. (S.) You also say, [using بين
to denote An interval of time,] لَقِيتُهُ بُعَيْدَاتِ بَيْنٍ
[I met him after, or a little after, an interval, or
intervals,] when you have met him after a while,
and then withheld yourself from him, and then
come to him. (S, M, K. See also بَعْدُ.])
-A2-
Also Union [of companions or friends or lovers];
(T, S, M, Msb, K;) the contr. of the first of the
significations mentioned above in this paragraph.
(T, S, Msb.) [Hence ذَاتُ البَيْنِ as meaning The
state of union or concord or friendship or love
subsisting between a people or between two parties; this being likewise the contr. of a signification assigned to the same expression above:
whence the phrase, إِفْسَادُ ذَاتِ البَيْنِ (occurring in
the S and K in art. ابر, and often elsewhere,)
The marring, or disturbance, of the state of
union or concord &c.: and] hence the saying,
سَعَى فُلَانٌ لِإِصْلَاحِ ذَاتِ البَيْنِ مِنْ عَشِيرَتِهِ [Such a
one laboured for the improving of the state
of union or concord &c. of his kinsfolk; but
in this instance, the meaning given in the second
sentence of this paragraph seems to be more appropriate]. (Ham p. 569.) ―
-b2-  ذَاتُ بَيْنِهِمْ may also
be used as meaning The vacant space (سَاحَة) that
is between their houses, or tents. (Ham p. 195.)
-A3-  بَيْن is also an adverbial noun, [as such written
بَيْنَ,] (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) capable of being
used as a noun absolutely: (M, K:) it relates
only to that which has space, as a country; or to
that which has some number, either two or more,
as two men, and a company of men; and denotes
[intervention in] the interval between two things,
or the middle, or midst, of two things, (Er-Rághib, TA,) or the middle of a collective number: (S:) [thus it signifies Between, and amidst,
and among:] its meaning is [therefore] vague,
not apparent unless it is prefixed to two or more
[words, or to a word signifying two or more], or
to what supplies the place of such a complement:
(Msb:) it must necessarily be prefixed, and may
not be otherwise than in the manners just explained: (Mgh:) [i. e.] it may not be prefixed to
any noun but such as denotes more than one, or
to a noun that has another conjoined to it by و,
(M,) not by any other conjunction, (M, Msb,)
acc0ord. to the usage commonly obtaining. (Msb.)
You say بَيْنَ الرَّجُلَيْنِ [Between the two men]:
(Er-Rághib, TA:) and المَالُ بَيْنَ القَوْمِ [The property is between the company of men]: (M, Msb,
Er-Rághib: *) and المَالُ بَيْنَ زَيْدٍ وَعَمْرٍو [The
property is between Zeyd and 'Amr]: and هُوَ
بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَهُ [He, or it, is between me and him]:
(M:) and جَلَسْتُ بَيْنَ القَوْمِ I sat in the middle
of [or amidst or among] the company of men:
(S, K:) and بَيْنَكُمَا البَعِيرَ فَخُذَاهُ, with البعير in the
accus. case, [See between you two the camel,
therefore take him], a saying heard by Ks: (Lin
art. عند:) and فَسَدَ مَا بَيْنَهُمْ [The state subsisting
among them became bad, or marred, or disturbed]:
(S and K in art. ميط:) and بَيْنَ الأَيَّامِ (M and K
in art. ندر) and فِيمَا بَيْنَ الأَيَّامِ (S and Msb in
that art.) [In, or during, the space of (several)
days]: and عَوَانٌ بَيْنَ ذٰلِكَ, in the Kur [ii. 63], is
an ex. of its being prefixed to a single word supplying the place of more than one; (Mgh, Msb;)
the meaning being, Of middle age, between that
which has been mentioned; namely, the فَارِض
and the بِكْر. (Bd.) Some allow that two words
to the former of which بَيْنَ is prefixed may be
connected by فَ, citing as an evidence the phrase
used by Imra-el-Keys, بَيْنَ الدَّخُولِ فَحَوْمَلِ [as
though meaning Between Ed-Dakhool and Howmal]: but to this it has been replied that الدخول
is a name applying to several places; so that the
phrase [means amidst Ed-Dakhool &c., and] is
similar to the saying, المَالُ بَيْنَ القَوْمِ [mentioned
above, or جَلَسْتُ بَيْنَ القَوْمِ, also mentioned above].
(Msb.) [You say also, بَيْنَ أَظْهُرِهِمْ, and بَيْنَ ظَهْرَيْهِمْ
&c., meaning In the midst of them. (See art.
ظهر.) And بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ, and بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِمْ, meaning
Before him, and before them. بَيْن is also often
used absolutely as a noun: thus it is in the Kur
lxxxvi. 7, يَخْرُجُ مِنْ بَيْنِ الصُّلْبِ وَالتَّرَائِبِ Coming
forth from between, or amidst, the spine and the
breast-bones: and in xxxvi. 8 of the same, وَجَعَلْنَا
مِنْ بَيْنِ أَيْديهِمْ سَدًّا And we have placed before
them (lit. between their hands) a barrier.] It is
said in the Kur [vi. 94], لَقَدْ تَقَطَّعَ بَيْنُكُمْ, as some
read; or بَيْنَكُمْ, as others: (T, S, M:) the former
means Verily your union hath become dissevered:
(AA, T, S, M:) the latter, that which was between
you; (مَا بَيْنَكُمْ, Ibn-Mes'ood, T, S, or الَّذِى كَانَ
بَيْنَكُمْ, IAar, T;) or the state wherein ye were, in
respect of partnership among you: (Zj, T:) or
the state of circumstances, or the bond, or the
love, or affection, [formerly subsisting] among
you, or between you; or, accord. to Akh, بَيْنَكُمْ,
though in the accus. case as to the letter, is in the
nom. case as to the place, by reason of the verb,
and the adverbial termination is retained only because the word is commonly used as an adv. n.:
(M:) AHát disapproved of the latter reading;
but wrongly, because what is suppressed accord.
to this reading is implied by what precedes in the
same verse. (T.) ―
-b2-  [It is often used as a partitive,
or distributive; as also مَا بَيْنَ: for ex.,] you say,
هُمْ بَيْنَ حَاذِفٍ وَقَاذِفٍ, (S and TA in art. قذف,)
or هُمْ مَا بَيْنَ حَاذفٍ وقاذفٍ, (TA in art. حذف,)
i. e. [They are partly, or in part,] beating with
the staff, or stick, and [partly, or in part,] pelting
with stones; [or some beating &c., and the others
pelting &c.] (S and TA, both in art. قذف, and
the latter in art. حذف.) [See also an ex. in a
verse cited voce خَيْطَةٌ.] ―
-b3-  هٰذَا بَيْنَ بَيْنَ means
This (namely, a thing, S, or a commodity, Msb)
is between good and bad: (S, Msb, K:) or of a
middling, or middle, sort: (M:) these two words
being two nouns made one, and indecl., with
fet-h for their terminations, (S, Msb, K,) like
خَمْسَةَ عَشَرَ. (Msb.) الهَمْزَةُ المُخَفَّفَةُ [i. e. the
hemzeh uttered lightly] is called هَمْزَةٌ بَيْنَ بَيْنَ,
(S, M, K, *) i. e. A hemzeh that is between the
hemzeh and the soft letter whence is its vowel; (S,
M;) or هَمْزَةُ بَيْنِ بَيْنٍ, the first بين with kesreh
but without tenween, and the second with tenween,
(Sharh Shudhoor edh-Dhahab,) [i. e. the hemzeh
&c.:] if it is with fet-h, it is between the hemzeh
and the alif, as in سَاَلَ, (S, M,) for سَأَلَ; (M;) if
with kesr, it is between the hemzeh and the yé,
as in سَيِمَ, (S, M,) for سَئِمَ; (M;) and if with
damm, it is between the hemzeh and the wáw, as
in لَوُمَ, (S, M,) for لَؤُمَ: (M:) it is never at the
beginning of a word, because of its nearness, by
reason of feebleness, to the letter that is quiescent,
(S, M,) though, notwithstanding this, it is really
movent: (S:) it is thus called because it is weak,
(Sb, S, M,) not having the power of the hemzeh
uttered with its proper sound, nor the clearness of
the letter whence is its vowel. (M.) 'Obeyd Ibn-El-Abras says,
تَحْمِى حَقِيقَتَنَا وَبَعْ ضُ القَوْمِ يَسْقُطُ بَيْنَ بَيْنَا
i. e. [Thou defendest what we ought to defend, or
our banner, or standard, while some of the people,
or company of men,] fall, one after another, in a
state of weakness, not regarded as of any account:
(S:) or it is as though he said, between these and
these; like a man who enters between two parties
in some affair, and falls, or slips, or commits a
mistake, and is not honourably mentioned in
relation to it: so says Seer: (IB, TA:) or between
entering into fight and holding back from it; as
when one says, Such a one puts forward a foot,
and puts back another. (TA.) ―
-b4-  ↓ بَيْنَا and ↓ بَيْنَمَا
are of the number of inceptive حُرُوف: (M, K:)
this is clear if by حروف is meant "words:" that
they have become particles, no one says: they are
still adv. ns.: (MF, TA:) the former is بَيْنَ with
its [final] fet-hah rendered full in sound; and
hence the ا; (Mughnee in the section next after
that of وا, and K;) [i. e.,] it is of the measure
فَعْلَى [or فَعْلَا] from البَيْن, the [final] fet-hah
being rendered full in sound, and so becoming ا;
and the latter is بَيْنَ with مَا [restrictive of its
government] added to it; and both have the same
meaning [of While, or whilst]: (S:) or the ا in
the former is the restrictive ا; or, as some say, it
is a portion of the restrictive ما [in the latter]:
(Mughnee ubi suprà:) and these do not exclude
بَيْنَ from the category of nouns, but only cut it
off from being prefixed to another noun: (MF,
TA:) they are substitutes for that to which بَيْنَ
would otherwise be prefixed: (Mgh:) some say
that these two words are adv. ns. of time, denoting
a thing's happening suddenly, or unexpectedly;
and they are prefixed to a proposition consisting
of a verb and an agent, or an inchoative and
enunciative; so that they require a complement
to complete the meaning. (TA.) One says, بَيْنَا
نَحْنُ كَذٰلِكَ إِذْ حَدَثَ كَذَا [While we were in
such a state as that, lo, or there, or then, such a
thing happened, or came to pass]: (M, Mgh, *
K: *) and بَيْنَمَا نَحْنُ كَذَا [While we were thus]:
(Mgh:) and
بَيْنَا نَحْنُ نَرْقُبُهُ أَتَانَا
[While we were looking, or waiting, for him, he
came to us]; (S, M;) a saying of a poet, cited by
Sb; (M;) the phrase being elliptical; (S, M;)
meaning بَيْنَ أَوْقَاتِ نَحْنُ نَرْقُبُهُ, (M,) i. e., بَيْنَ
أَوْقَاتِ رِقْبَتِنَا إِيَّاهُ [between the times of our looking,
or waiting, for him]. (S, M.) As used to put
nouns following بَيْنَا in the gen. case when بَيْنَ
might properly supply its place; as in the saying
(of Aboo-Dhu-eyb, which he thus recited, with
kesr, S),
بَيْنَا تَعَنُّقِهِ الكُمَاةَ وَرَوْغِهِ
يَوْمًا أُتِيحَ لَهُ جَرِىْءٌ سَلْفَعُ
[Amid his embracing the courageous armed men,
and his guileful eluding, one day a bold, daring
man was appointed for him, to slay him]: (S,
K:) in [some copies of] the K, تَعَنُّفِهِ; but in the
Deewán [of the Hudhalees], تعنّقه: [in the Mughnee, ubi suprà, تَعَانُقِهِ:] the meaning is بَيْنَ تَعَانُقِهِ;
the ا being added to give fulness to the sound of
the [final] vowel: (TA:) As used to say that the
ا is here redundant: (Skr, TA:) others put the
nouns following both بَيْنَا and بَيْنَمَا in the nom.
case, as the inchoative and enunciative. (Skr, S,
K.) Mbr says that when the noun following
بينا is a real subst., it is put in the nom. case as
an inchoative; but when it is an inf. n., or a noun
of the inf. kind, it is put in the gen., and بينا
in this instance has the meaning of بَيْنَ: and
Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà says the like, but some persons of chaste speech treat the latter kind of noun
like the former: after بينما, however, each kind
of noun must be in the nom. case. (AA, T.)
[See an ex. in a verse cited towards the end of
art. اذ.]
بَيْنَا see بَيْنٌ
بَيْنَمَا see بَيْنٌ
بِينٌ A separation, or division, (T, M, K,) between two things, (T,) or between two lands; (M,
K;) as when there is a rugged place, with sands
near it, and between the two is a tract neither
rugged nor plain: (T:) an elevation in rugged
ground: (M, K:) the extent to which the eye
reaches, (T, M, K,) of a road, (T,) or of land:
(M:) a piece of land extending as far as the eye
reaches: (T, S:) and a region, tract, or quarter:
(AA, T, M, K:) pl. بُيُونٌ. (S, TA.)
بَيَانٌ is originally the inf. n. of بَانَ as syn. with
تَبَيَّنَ, and so signifies The being [distinct or]
apparent &c.; (Kull;) or it is a subst. in this
sense: (Msb:) or a subst. from بَيَّنَ, [and so
signifies the making distinct or apparent &c.,]
being like سَلَامٌ and كَلَامٌ from سَلَّمَ and كَلَّمَ.
(Kull.) ―
-b2-  Hence, conventionally, (Kull,) The
means by which one makes a thing [distinct,]
apparent, manifest, evident, clear, plain, or perspicuous: (S, Er-Rághib, TA, Kull:) this is of
two kinds: one is [a circumstantial indication
or evidence; or] a thing indicating, or giving
evidence of, a circumstance, or state, that is a
result, or an effect, of a quality or an attribute:
the other is a verbal indication or evidence, either
spoken or written: [see also بَيِّنَةٌ:] it is also
applied to language that discovers and shows the
meaning that is intended: and an explanation of
confused and vague language: (Er-Rághib, TA:)
or the eduction of a thing from a state of dubiousness to a state of clearness: or making the meaning apparent to the mind so that it becomes
distinct from other meanings and from what
might be confounded with it. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Also
Perspicuity, clearness, distinctness, chasteness, or
eloquence, of speech or language: (T, S:) or
simply perspicuity thereof: (Har p. 2:) or perspicuity of speech with quickness, or sharpness, of
intellect: (M, K:) or perspicuous, or chaste, or
eloquent, speech, declaring, or telling plainly,
what is in the mind: (Ksh, TA:) or the showing
of the intent, or meaning, with the most eloquent
expression: it is an effect of understanding, and
of sharpness, or quickness, of mind, with perspicuity, or chasteness, or eloquence, of speech:
(Nh, TA:) or a faculty, or principles, [or a
science,] whereby one knows how to express [with
perspicuity of diction] one meaning in various
forms: (Kull:) [some of the Arabs restrict the
science of البيان to what concerns comparisons
and tropes and metonymies; which last the
Arabian rhetoricians distinguish from tropes: and
some make it to include rhetoric altogether:]
Esh-Shereeshee says, in his Expos. of the Maká-
mát [of El-Hareeree] that the difference between
بَيَانٌ and ↓ تِبْيَانٌ is this: that the former denotes
perspicuity of meaning; and the latter, the making
the meaning to be understood; and the former is
to another person, and the latter to oneself; but
sometimes the latter is used in the sense of the
former: (TA:) or the former is the act of the
tongue, and the latter is the act of the mind:
(Har p. 2:) or the former concerns the verbal
expression, and the latter concerns the meaning.
(Kull.) It is said in a trad., إِنَّ مِنَ البَيَانِ سِحْرًا
(S) or لَسِحْرًا (TA) [Verily there is a kind of
eloquence that is enchantment: see this explained
in art. سحر]. The saying in the Kur [lv. 2 and
3], خَلَقَ الْإِنْسَانَ عَلَّمَهُ الْبَيَانَ means He hath
created the Prophet: He hath taught him the
Kur-án wherein is the manifestation of everything
[needful to be known]: or He hath created Adam,
or man as meaning all mankind: He hath [taught
him speech, and so] made him to discriminate,
and thus to be distinguished from all [other]
animals:(Zj, T:) or He hath taught him that
whereby he is distinguished from other animals,
namely, the declaration of what is in the mind,
and the making others to understand what he has
perceived, for the reception of inspiration, and
the becoming acquainted with the truth, and the
learning of the law. (Bd.) ―
-b4-  It is also applied
to Verbosity, and the going deep, or being extravagant, in speech, and affecting to be perspicuous,
or chaste, therein, or eloquent, and pretending to
excel others therein; or some بيان is thus termed;
and is blamed in a trad., as a kind of hypocrisy;
as though it were a sort of self-conceit and pride.
(TA.)
بِئْرٌ بَيُونٌ A well of which the rope does not
strike against the sides, because its interior is
straight: or that is wide in the upper part, and
narrow in the lower: or in which the drawer of
water makes the rope to be aloof from its sides,
because of its crookedness: (T:) or deep and
wide; (S, K;) because the ropes are wide apart
from its sides; (S;) as also ↓ بَائِنَةٌ: (S, TA:) or
that is wide between the two [opposite] sides:
(M:) pl. [regularly of the latter epithet] بَوَائِنُ.
(T, S.)
بَيِّنٌ [Distinct, as though separate from others;
and thus,] apparent, manifest, evident, clear,
plain, or perspicuous; (T, S, Msb, K;) as also
↓ بَائِنٌ (T) and ↓ مُبِينٌ: (T, S:) pl. [of mult.] أَبْيِنَآءُ
(S, K) and [of pauc.] بَيِنَةٌ. (K.) Hence, الكِتَابُ
↓ المُبِينٌ [as applied to the Kur, q. v. in xii. 1,
&c.,] The clear, plain, or perspicuous, book or
writing or scripture: or, as some say, this means
the book &c. that makes manifest all that is
required [to be known]: (T:) or, of which the
goodness and the blessing are made manifest: or,
that makes manifest the truth as distinguished
from falsity, and what is lawful as distinguished
from what is unlawful, and that the prophetic
office of Mohammad is true, and so are the narratives relating to the prophets: (Zj, T:) or, that
makes manifest the right paths as distinguished
from the wrong. (M, TA.) And كَلَامٌ بَيِّنٌ
Perspicuous, clear, distinct, chaste, or eloquent,
language. (T.) ―
-b2-  A man, or thing, bearing evidence of a quality &c. that he, or it, possesses. (S
and K and other Lexicons passim.) ―
-b3-  A man
(M) perspicuous, or clear, or distinct, in speech
or language; or chaste therein; or eloquent;
(ISh, T, M, K;) fluent, elegant, and elevated, in
speech, and having little hesitation therein: (ISh,
T:) pl. أَبْيِنَآءُ (T, M, K) and بُيَنَآءُ and [of pauc.]
أَبْيَانٌ: (Lh, M, K:) the second of these pls. is
anomalous: the last is formed by likening فَعِيلٌ
to فَاعِلٌ: [for بَيِّنٌ is a contraction of بَيِينٌ:] but
the pl. most agreeable with analogy is بَيِّنُونَ: so
says Sb. (M.)
بَيِّنَةٌ An evidence, an indication, a demonstration, a proof, a voucher, or an argument, (Mgh,
TA,) such as is manifest, or. clear, whether intellectual or perceived by sense; (TA;) [originally
بَيِينَةٌ,] of the measure فَعِيلَةٌ, from بَيْنُونَةٌ, [see 1,
first sentence,] and بَيَانٌ [q. v.]: (Mgh:) and
the testimony of a witness: pl. بَيِّنَاتٌ. (TA.)
بَائِنٌ In a state of separation or disunion; or
separated, severed, disunited, or cut off; (M, *
Msb;) as also ↓ أَبْيَنُ, occurring in a verse cited
above, voce بَيِّنَ. [Hence,] اِمْرَأَةٌ بَائِنٌ A woman
separated from her husband by divorce; (M,
Msb, K;) as also ↓ مُبَانَةٌ: the former without ة:
(Msb:) like طَالِقٌ and حَائِضٌ: you say [to a
wife] أَنْتِ بَائِنٌ [Thou art separated from me
by divorce.] (Mgh.) ―
-b2-  طَلَاقٌ بَائِنٌ is a tropical
phrase; and so is طَلْقَةٌ بَائِنَةٌ; (Mgh;) [signifying the same as] تَطْلِيقَةٌ بَائِنَةٌ (S, M, Msb, K) (tropical:)  A
divorce that is [as it were] cut off; i. q. ↓ مُبَانَةٌ
[in the second and third of these phrases, and
↓ مُبَانٌ in the first]: (ISk, Msb:) بائنة being here
used in the sense of a pass. part. n.: (S, Sgh,
Msb:) or it [is a possessive epithet, and thus]
means having separation: this kind of divorce is
one in the case of which the man cannot take
back the woman unless by a new contract; (TA;)
nor without her consent. (MF in art. بت.) ―
-b3-
قَوْسٌ بَائِنَةٌ, (S, M, K,) and بَائِنٌ, (M, K,) A bow
that is widely separate from its string: (S, M,
K:) contr. of بَانِيَةٌ; (S, M;) this signifying one
that is so near to its string as almost to stick to
it: (S:) each of these denotes what is a fault.
(S, M.) ―
-b4-  بِئْرٌ بَائِنَةٌ: see بَيُونٌ. ―
-b5-  نَخْلَةٌ بَائِنَةٌ A
palm-tree of which the racemes have come forth
from the spathes, and of which the fruit-stalks
have grown long. (AHn, M.) ―
-b6-  البَائِنُ also signifies He who comes to the milch beast [meaning
the she-camel, when she is to be milked,] from her
left side; (S, K;) and المُعَلِّى, he who comes to
her from her right side: (S:) or the former, he
who stands on the right of the she-camel when she
is milked, and holds the milking-vessel, and raises
it to the milker, who stands on her left, and is
called المُسْتَعْلِى: (T:) two persons are engaged
in milking the she-camel; one of them holds the
milking-vessel on the right side, and the other
milks on the left side; and the milker is called
المُسْتَعْلِى and المُعَلِّى; and the holder, البائن:
(M:) pl. بُيَّنٌ. (T.) It is said in a prov., اِسْتُ
البَائِنِ أَعْرَفُ, or, as some say, أَعْلَمُ; meaning (assumed tropical:)  He
who has superintended an affair, and exercised
himself diligently in the management thereof, is
better acquainted with it than he who has not done
this. (T. [See Freytag's Arab. Prov. i. 606.])
―
-b7-  طَوِيلٌ بَائِنٌ Excessively tall, far above the
stature of tall men. (TA.)
-A2-  See also بَيِّنٌ.
طَلَبَ إِلَى أَبَوَيْهِ البَائِنَةَ He asked, or begged, of
his two parents, the separation of himself from
them, by [their giving him] property, (AZ, T,
M,) to be his alone. (T.)
أَبْيَنُ: see بَائِنٌ.
-A2-  فُلَانٌ أَبْيَنُ مِنْ فُلَانٍ Such
a one is more perspicuous, clear, distinct, chaste,
or eloquent, in speech or language, than such a
one. (S, TA.)
تِبْيَانٌ an anomalous inf. n. (T, S, K) of 2,
q. v.: (T:) or a subst. used as an inf. n.; (MF,
TA;) i. e., a subst. from 2. (Sb, M, TA.) See بَيَانٌ.
مُبَانٌ; and its fem., with ة: see بَائِنٌ, in three
places.
مُبِينٌ Separating, severing, disuniting, or cutting off; (S, K;) as also مُبْيِنٌ, like مُحْسِنٌ:
(K:) but [the right reading in the K may be
وَمُبِينٌ كَمُحْسِنٍ, meaning "and مُبِينٌ is like
مُحْسِنٌ:" if not,] مُبْيِنٌ is a mistake. (TA.)
-A2-
See also بَيِّنٌ, in two places.
مَبَايِنُ الحَقِّ [in which the former word is app.
pl. of مُبِينَةٌ] signifies The things that make the
truth to be apparent, manifest, evident, clear, or
plain; or the means of making it so; syn.
مَوَاضِحُهُ. (TA.)
