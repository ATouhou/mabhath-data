بره1
بَرِهَ, aor.
بَرَهَ, inf. n. بَرَهٌ, or, as in some copies
of the K, بَرَهَانٌ, (TA, [and so I find in an excellent
copy of the K, but in the CK بُرْهَان,]) His body
returned to a healthy state, or his health of body
returned to him, or his bodily condition became
good, after having been altered by disease. (IAar,
K. *) [The ه is perhaps a substitute for ء: see
بَرِئَ.] ―
-b2-  And He was, or became, white in person,
or body and members. (K.) ―
-b3-  See also بَرَهٌ, below.

ابره He adduced the evidence or proof:
(Msb, K:) but as to ↓ بَرْهَنَ, meaning he manifested the evidence or proof, it is said, on the
authority of IAar, to be post-classical; the former
being the correct word: (AA, T, Z, Msb, TA:)
or the former signifies he adduced, or uttered, or
did, wonderful things, and overcame men. (K.)
Q. Q., or, as some say, Q., 1. بَرْهَنَ: see 4;

بَرَهٌ [perhaps an inf. n., of which the verb is
↓ بَرِهَ,] Softness, thinness of skin, and plumpness,

بُرْهَةٌ and ↓ بَرْهَةٌ A long space or period of time:
(JK, S:) or a long time: (ISk, K:) or they
have a more general sense; (K;) i. e. a space,
or period, of time: pl. of the former بُرَهٌ and
بُرْهَاتٌ and بُرَهَاتٌ and بُرَهَاتٌ. (Msb.) You say,
أَتَتْ عَلَيْهِ بُرْهَةٌ مِنَ الدَّهْرِ and بَرْهَةٌ [A long space
or period of time, or merely a space or period
of time, passed over him]. (S.)

Msb) or female: (JK:) or a woman (S, K,)
white and youthful: or soft, or tender: (K:)
or that quivers, (K,) or almost quivers, (S,) from
sappiness, softness, or tenderness: (S,* K:) or
that shines, or glistens, by reason of her clearness
[of complexion]: or thin-skinned; appearing as
though water were running upon her, by reason
of her softness, or tenderness: (TA:) of the
measure فَعَلْعَلَةٌ, (S, TA,) from بَرَهٌ: (TA:) dim.
↓ بُرَيْهَةٌ (JK, TA) and ↓ بُرَيْرِهَةٌ, (JK,) or ↓ بُرَيْرِيهَةٌ;
but ↓ بُرَيْهِرَهَةٌ is bad, and seldom used. (TA.)
Imra-el-Keys says,
بَرَهْرَهَةٌ رُؤَدَةً رَخْصَةٌ كَخُرْعُويَةِ البَانَةِ المُنْفَطِرْ
[White, or white and youthful, &c., soft, or
beautiful, tender, like the shoot of the ben-tree
breaking forth with leaves: the last word being
made masc. by poetic license, for the sake of the
metre.]. (S.) ―

have both these significations, or only the latter
of them, is not clear:] fem. بَرْهَآءُ. (K.)
