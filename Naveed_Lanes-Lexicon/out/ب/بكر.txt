(T, S;) and ↓ بكّر, (T, S, A,) inf. n. تَبْكِيرٌ; (T,
S;) and ↓ ابكر, and ↓ ابتكر, (S, A,) and ↓ باكر;
(S;) all signify the same; (S;) He (a traveller,
A) went forth early in the morning, in the first
part of the day; or between the time of the prayer
of daybreak and sunrise; syn. خَرَجَ فِى البُكْرَةِ:
(T, A:) or ↓ ابكر, inf. n. إِبْكَارٌ, signifies he entered
upon that time: (T:) one should not say بَكُرَ
nor بَكِرَ in the sense of بكّر [&c.]. (S.) ―
-b2-  You
say also, بَكَرَ إِلَيْهِ, and عَلَيْهِ, and فِيهِ, inf. n. as

daybreak and sunrise: and he did it at that
time: or بَكَرَ &c. with فِيهِ following may be rendered he occupied himself at that time in doing
it]. (K.) ―

(AZ, S:) and الوِرْدَ ↓ ابكر, (TA,) and الغَدَآءَ, (AZ,
S, TA,) (assumed tropical:)  He hastened to come to water, and to

coming to water early in the morning, in the

occurring in a trad., (S, Msb,) respecting [the
prayers of] Friday, (S,) means (tropical:)  Whoso hasteneth,
(S, Msb,) and arriveth in time to hear the first
portion of the خُطْبَة, (S,) or heareth the first
portion thereof: (Msb:) or whoso hasteneth,

the prayer at the first of its time: or, accord. to
Aboo-Sa'eed, whoso hasteneth to the Fridayprayers, before the call to prayer, and arriveth
at the commencement of their time: or both the
verbs signify the same, and the [virtual] repetition is to give intensiveness and strength to the
meaning. (TA. [See 2.]) ―
-b3-  You say also, ابتكرهُ,
meaning (tropical:)  He took, (A, Msb,) or obtained possession of, (S, TA,) its بَاكُورَة, (S, TA,) i. e.,

بَكْرٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K, &c.) and ↓ بُكْرٌ, (K,) but
this latter is hardly to be found in any of the
lexicons, (MF,) and ↓ بِكْرٌ, (ISd, TA,) A youthful
he-camel; one in a state of youthful vigour: fem.
with ة; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;) and also بَكْرٌ, without
ة: (TA:) the term بَكْرٌ, applied to a camel, corresponds to فَتًى, applied to a human being; and
بَكْرَةٌ, to فَتَاةٌ; and قَلُوصٌ, to جَارِيَةٌ; and بَعِيرٌ, to
إِنْسَانٌ; and جَمَلٌ, to رَجُلٌ; and نَاقَةٌ, to مَرْأَةٌ:
(AO, S:) or the offspring, or young one, of a she-camel; (K;) thus indefinitely explained: (TA:)
or a camel in his sixth year (ثَنِىٌّ) [and] until he
becomes a جَذَع: [but it seems that the reverse
must be meant; for a جذع, of camels, is one in
his fifth year:] or a camel in his second year
[and] until he enters his sixth year: or a camel
in his second year, or that has entered his third
year, or that has completed his second year and
entered his third year; syn. اِبْنُ لَبُونٍ: (K:) and
a camel that has just entered upon his fourth year:
and a camel in his fifth year: (IAar, Az:) or a
camel that has not entered his ninth year: (K:)
and sometimes it is metaphorically applied to a
human being; [meaning (tropical:)  a young man;] and
بَكْرَةٌ to (tropical:)  a young woman: (TA:) the pl. (of
pauc., S) is أَبْكُرٌ; (S, K;) and ↓ أُبَيْكِرُونَ occurs
as pl. of the dim. of أَبْكُرٌ; (S, TA;) and (pl. of
mult., S, TA) بِكَارٌ, (S, Msb,) like as فِرَاخٌ is pl.
of فَرْخٌ; (S;) or this is pl. of بَكْرَةٌ; (Msb, K;)
and there are other pls. of بَكْرٌ, namely, بُكْرَانٌ
(K) and بِكَارَةٌ; (S, Msb, K;) and [quasi-pl. n.]
↓ بَكَارَةٌ. (K.) Hence the well-known prov., (TA,)
صَدَقَنِى سِنَّ بَكْرِهِ, and سِنُّ بَكْرِهِ, meaning He hath
told me what is in his mind, and what his ribs
infold: a saying originating from the following
fact: a man bargained with another for a youthful
camel (بَكْر), and said, “What is his age (سِنُّهُ)? ”
the other answered, “He is in his ninth year: ”
then the young camel took fright and ran away:
whereupon his owner said to him, هِدَعْ هِدَعْ; and
this is an expression by which are quieted young
ones, (K,) of the camel; (TA;) so when the
purchaser heard it, he said, صدقنى سنّ بكره [He
hath told me truly the age, or as to the age, of his
youthful camel: or the age of his youthful camel
has spoken truly to me]: if سنّ is in the accus.
case, the meaning [of the verb] is عَرَّفَنِى, (K,)
and سنّ is in the accus. case as a second objective
complement; (TA;) or خَبَرَ سِنِّ is meant; [in
the CK, erroneously, خَبَرَ;] or فِى سِنِّ; the
prefixed noun [خَبَرَ] or the proposition [فِى]
being suppressed [and سنّ being therefore in the
accus. case]: but if سنّ is in the nom. case,
veracity is attributed to the [animal's] age, by an
amplification: (K:) or, as some say, the buyer
said to the owner of the camel, “How many
years has he? ” and he told him; and he looked
at the teeth of the camel, and found him to be as
he had said; whereupon he said, صدقنى سِنُّ بكره.

بَكَرٌ: see بُكْرَةٌ, in three places:
-A2-  and see also
بَكْرَةٌ.
رَجُلٌ بَكُرٌ فِى حَاجَتِهِ, [in the CK, erroneously,

to do, or accomplish, the thing that he needs, or
wants: (S:) بَكُرٌ and بَكِرٌ [and بَكِيرٌ] are [said to

the former, anomalous, like حَلَقٌ pl. of حَلْقَةٌ, and
حَمَأٌ pl. of حَمْأَةٌ, (S,) or of the latter; (Msb;) or
a coll. gen. n., of which بَكَرَةٌ is the n. un.; (MF;)
and بَكَرَات, (S, Msb, K,) a pl. of the former [as

they were few: (see Freytag's Arab. Prov. i. 312:)
or] from بَكَّرْتُ فِى كَذَا meaning “ I was,” or
“ became,” or “ went,” “ before in such a thing; ”
so that it signifies that they came from first to
last: (IJ:) or from بكرة in the first of the senses
explained in this paragraph; though in this case
there is no بكرة in reality. (AO, S. *)
بُكْرَةٌ and ↓ بَكَرٌ The early morning, or first part of

&c.]. (S, A, Msb.) But if you mean the بُكْرَةٌ of
a particular day, you say, أَتَيْتُهُ بُكْرَةَ, making the
noun imperfectly decl.; [meaning I came to him
early in the morning, &c., of this day;] and in
this case it is not to be used otherwise than as an
adv. n. of time. (S.) If you say ↓ بَاكِرًا, using
this word as an epithet, you use بَاكِرَة for the
fem. (TA.) You say also, سِرْ عَلَى فَرَسِكَ بُكْرَةً
and ↓ بَكَرًا [Go thou on thy horse early in the
morning, &c.]; like as you say, سَحَرًا. (S, TA.
