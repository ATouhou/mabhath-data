the frequented waters, (TA,) from fear of being

and possesses much knowledge thereof: to such,
therefore, is likened (tropical:)  a man knowing, or skilful,
in affairs, who investigates them much, and is
experienced therein; the ة being added to give
intensiveness to the signification: (TA:) and
(tropical:)  sharp, or quick, in intellect; knowing; whom

beguiled, or circumvented: (K, TA:) pl. بَوَاقِعُ.

party-coloured, or pied: (Msb:) or the whitewinged غراب: (ISh, TA in art. حذف:) pl., when
thus applied, بُقْعَانٌ, (TA,) or بِقْعَانٌ, with kesr;
the quality of a subst. being predominant in it;
but when it is regarded as an epithet, [in which
case the fem. is بَقْعَآءُ,] its pl. is بُقْعٌ. (Msb.) ―

blackness; (S;) or because of their whiteness
and redness and blackness likened to a thing such
as is termed أَبْقَعُ; (TA;) or (K) because they
are of the Greeks and the Negroes: (S, K:) or
so called because of the mixture of their colours;
their predominant colours being white and yellow:
A'Obeyd says that what is meant is whiteness
and yellowness, and they are thus called because
of their difference of colours and their being begotten of two races: but Kt says, البُقْعَانُ signifies
(assumed tropical:)  those in whom is blackness and whiteness; and
one who is white without any admixture of blackness is not called ابقع: how then should the
Greeks be called بقعان when they are purely
white? and he adds that he thinks the meaning
to be, the offspring of Arabs, who are black,
[which is not to be understood literally, but rather
in the sense of swarthy,] by female slaves of the
Greeks, who are white. (TA.) ―

called] the رَبِيع: (Mgh:) or whatever herbs, or
plants, grow from seed, (AHn, Mgh, K,*) not

explained the saying that the cucumber is of the
things termed بُقُولٌ [pl. of بَقْلٌ, meaning sorts,
or species, of بَقْل], not of those termed فَوَاكِهُ:
(Mgh:) or the kind of which the root and branch

or herb, but the clear and open piece of good land]:
(TA:) [i. e., only a good parent produces good

humours; but it is good for the cough, and for
rendering the body fruitful (تَخْصِيب البَدَن);
when properly qualified [app. by seasoning or
by some admixture] (إِذَا أُصْلِحَ), it preserves the
health; and in its green state, together with ginger,
it has the utmost effect in strengthening the venereal faculty: (K:) the pl. is بَوَاقِلُ: and the
dim. of باقّلى is ↓ بُوَيْقِلَةٌ and ↓ بُوَيْقِلْيَةٌ, the latter
with the ل quiescent because kesreh is disapproved

باقلّى is held to be fem.;] and that of باقلآء is
بُوَيْقِلَآء [with or without tenween accord. as it is
held to be masc. or fem.], or, if one will, he
[who holds باقلآء to be fem.] may say ↓ بُوَيْقلَةٌ,
suppressing the augmentative meddeh, and adding

day to the colocasia; but what it properly denotes
is doubtful;] a certain plant, the grain of which
is smaller than the فُول [or bean]: (K:) the
