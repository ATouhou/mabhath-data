برثنبُرْثُنٌ, of the lion, (AZ, T,) and of any animal
of prey, (AZ, As, T, S, M, K,) and of birds, (As,
S,) [The toe; i. e.] what corresponds to the إِصْبَع
of a man; (AZ, As, T, S, M, K;) [in the Lex.
of Golius, as on the authority of the S, and in
that of Freytag, idem quod انملة in homine; but
this is a mistake, app. occasioned by a mistranscription in a copy of the S;] and the مِخْلَب is
its claw, i. e., nail: (AZ, As, T, S:) or the paw
(كَفّ), (M, K,) altogether, (M,) with the أَصَابِع
[or toes]: (M, K:) or the claw, i. e. nail, of the
lion, (Lth, T, M, K,) likened to the instrument
for perforating leather; (Lth, T;) and of [all]
animals of prey, and of birds that do not prey,
corresponding to the ظُفْر of man: Th says, of
man, it is [termed] the ظُفْر; of animals having
the kind of foot called خُفّ, the مَنْسِمْ; of solidhoofed animals, the حَافِر; of cloven-hoofed animals,
the ظِلْف; of beasts and birds of prey, the مِخْلَب;
and of birds that do not prey, and of dogs and the
like, the بُرْثُن; though it may be also used [in like
manner] of all animals of prey: (Msb:) [but
properly] it is of birds that do not prey, as the
crow-kind, and the pigeon; (M;) and sometimes,
of the [lizard called] ضَبّ, (S, M,) and of the rat,
or mouse, and of the jerboa: (M:) and is, in the
pl. form, (M, TA,) which is بَرَاثِنُ, (T, S, M,
TA,) metaphorically applied, by Sá'ideh Ibn-Jueiyeh, to the fingers of a man gathering honey
[deposited by wild bees in a hollow of a rock].
(M, * TA.) ―
-b2-  بُرْثُنُ الأَسَدِ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  A certain
brand, or mark made with a hot iron, upon
camels, (K, TA,) in the form of the claw of the
lion. (TA.) ―
-b3-  This, also, is the name of a sword
of Marthad Ibn-'Alas. (K.) ―
-b4-  [بُرْثُنَةٌ seems to
signify the same as بُرْثُنٌ or بَرَاثِنُ: for] Temeem
are termed in a trad. the بُرْثُمَة and بُرْجُمَة of the
tribes of Mudar; and El-Khattábee says that it
should be the بُرْثُنَة, i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [The claw, or] the
claws; meaning thereby their impetuous valour,
and strength: but برثمة may be a dial. var. of
برثنة, or the م may be substituted for the ن for
the purpose of assimilation [to برجمة]. (TA.)
