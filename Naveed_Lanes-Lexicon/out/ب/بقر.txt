بَقَرَ, (K,) [but this seems to be a mistake,]
inf. n. بَقْرٌ, (S, Msb,) He slit; ripped; split;
cut, or divided, lengthwise. (S, Msb, K, &c.) He
slit, or ripped open, an animal's belly. (A, Mgh.)
One says, اُبْقُرْهَا عَنْ جَنِينِهَا Rip thou open her

بَقَرَ, He (a dog) became confounded, (S, K,) and stupified, (TA,) with joy,
(K,) at seeing بَقَر, (S, K,) i. e., بَقَر الوَحْش [wild
oxen, or wild bulls or cows]; (TA;) like as one
says غَزِلَ meaning “ he sported,” or “ played,”
“ at seeing a gazelle,” or “ a young gazelle; ” as
also ↓ بَيْقَرَ: or the former, he feared, so that he
was astonished, amazed, or stupified, at seeing
many بَقَر: (TA voce بَحِزَ:) and ↓ the latter signifies also [simply] he became confounded, or perplexed: (IAar, TA:) and he doubted respecting
a thing. (K.) ―
-b2-  Also, aor. as above, inf. n. بَقَرٌ

saying that it is accord. to analogy بَقَرٌ, as the
verb is intrans.; (TA;) He (a man) became tired,
or fatigued, (S, K,) so that he could hardly see;
(K;) and he became weary, or jaded; (S, K;)

تبقّر It (a she-camel's belly) became ripped
open; as also ↓ ابتقر and ↓ انبقر. (TA.) ―
-b2-  It
became open. (As.) ―
-b3-  And i. q. توسّع; (As, K;)
as also ↓ تَبَيْقَرَ. (K.) So in the phrase تبقّر فِى
العِلْمِ [He enlarged himself, or took a wide range,
in science, or knowledge]; (S, A, Msb;) and
العِلْمَ ↓ بَقَرَ, inf. n. بَقْرٌ, signifies the same. (TA.)
And so in the phrase تبقّر فِى المَالِ, (S, A, Msb,)
and فى الأَهْلِ, (TA,) i. e., He enlarged himself,
or he became, or made himself, large, or abundant, in wealth, or camels or the like, and in

He was diffuse, or profuse, in speech; syn. تَفَتَّقَ
بِهِ. (A.)

بَقَرٌ a gen. n., (S, Msb,) a word of well-known
meaning, (S, Msb, K,) [The bovine genus; the
ox, or bull, and cow; and oxen, or bulls, and
cows; neat; black cattle;] applied to the domestic and the wild: (TA:) [but the wild have also
distinctive appellations, as will be seen below:]
n. un. بَقَرَةٌ, (S, Msb, K, [but in the K it is said
that بَقَرٌ is pl. of بَقَرَةٌ,]) which is applied to the
male and the female; (S, Msb, K;) the ة being
added only to restrict it to unity: (S, Msb:)
the pl. of بَقَرٌ is أَبْقُرٌ [a pl. of pauc.]; (M,) and
أَبْقَارٌ, meaning herds of oxen, or bulls, or cows:
(Msb and TA in art. ابل:) and the pl. of بَقَرَةٌ
is بَقَرَاتٌ (S, Msb, K) and بُقُرٌ and بُقَّارٌ (K) and
بَوَاقِرُ (As, T, K) and ↓ أُبْقُورٌ; (K;) [or rather
this last is a quasi-pl. n.;] and the following
[also] are quasi-pl. ns., namely, ↓ بَيْقُورٌ, (K,)
which is syn. with بَقَرٌ, (S,) and ↓ بَقِيرٌ, (K,) or
this signifies a collection, or herd, of بَقَر, (S,)
and ↓ بَاقِرٌ, (K,) or this signifies a collection, or
herd, of بَقَر with their pastors, (Lth, S,) and
↓ بَاقُورٌ, and ↓ بَاقُورَةٌ, (K,) or this last is syn. with
بَقَرَةٌ in the dial. of the people of El-Yemen: (S:)
or ↓ بَاقُورٌ and ↓ يَبْقُورٌ and ↓ أُبْقُورٌ are all syn. with
بَقَرٌ; and so, accord. to Ktr, is ↓ بَاقُورَةٌ. (Mgh.)

-b2-  بَقَرُ الوَحْشِ [and البَقَرُ الوَحْشِىُّ signify The
wild ox, or bull, and cow; and wild oxen, or
bulls, and cows, collectively: n. un. بَقَرَةُ الوَحْشِ
and البَقَرَةُ الوَحْشِيَّةُ; masc. and fem.: in Egypt,
these appellations are applied to the antilope defassa of modern zoologists: so says Sir Gardner
Wilkinson; and to this, I believe, they generally
apply in the poems &c. of the early Arabs: it is
a species of bovine antelope: in Barbary, it seems
that the animal thus called is another species
of bovine antelope, or perhaps a variety of the
former; it is said to be what is termed by Pallas
antilope bubalis; by others, alcephalus bubalis,
or acronotus bubalis; and this is said to come
occasionally to the Nile: but the Arabic appellations given above are employed with much laxity:
thus we find بَقَرُ الوَحْشِ explained as meaning] a
kind of animal of which there are four different
species: the first called مِهِا [i. e. مَهًا, a coll. gen. n.
of which the n. un. is مَهَاةٌ]; the second, ايل [i. e.
إِيَّلٌ]; the third يحمور [i. e. يَحْمُورٌ], or يامور
[i. e. يَأْمُورٌ]; the fourth, ثيثل [or ثَيْتَلٌ], and also
وعل [i. e. وَعْلٌ]: (Ed-Demeeree, cited by De
Sacy, erroneously written by him “ Domaïri,”
in his Chrest. Ar. sec. ed. ii. 435 et seq.:) or
what is called in Persian كوزن [or گَوَزْنْ (see
also إِيَّلٌ in art. اول)]; it has a great horn, with
branches; an additional branch growing upon
its horn every year; and its horn is solid, thus
differing from the horns of other animals, for
their horns are hollow: when it hears singing,
and the sounds of musical instruments, it listens
thereto, and then it takes no care to guard itself
from the arrows, by reason of its intense delight
therein: when it raises its ear, it hears sounds;
and when it relaxes it, it hears not anything.
(Kzw: also cited by De Sacy, ubi suprà.) The
Arabs regard بَقَر [meaning بقر الوحش] as ominous
of evil, because of the sharpness of their horns.
