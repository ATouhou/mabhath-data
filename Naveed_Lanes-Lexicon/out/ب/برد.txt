papyrus; and] of which mats are made; (Msb;)

were constructed of its stalks bound together; and
of such, probably, was the ark in which the infant
Moses was exposed: it is a coll. gen. n.:] n. un.

the conveyance of messengers] in a رِبَاط [or public
building for the accommodation of travellers and
their beasts, or in a سِكَّة, which is a house or the
like specially appropriated to messengers and the
beasts that carry them: thus it signifies a postmule: afterwards, it was applied also to a posthorse, and any beast appointed for the conveyance
of messengers]: (Mgh:) [this is what is meant
by the words in the S and K, البَرِيدُ المُرَتَّبُ:] it
is a word of Persian origin, (Z in the Fáïk,)
arabicized, from بُرِيدَهْ دُمْ, (Z in the Fáïk, and
Mgh,) i. e. “docked,” or “having the tail cut
off;” for the post-mules (بِغَالُ البَرِيدِ) had their
tails cut off in order that they might be known:
(Z in the Fáïk:) [or perhaps it is from the
Hebrew
פֶּרֶד “a mule:”] or it is applied to the
beast appointed for the conveyance of messengers
(دَابَّةُ البَرِيدِ) because he traverses the space called
بَرِيد [defined below: but the reason before given
for this appellation is more probable: it is like
the Lat. “veredus”]: (T, Msb:) pl. بُرُدٌ (Z, Mgh,
Msb) and بُرْدٌ, which is a contraction of the former,
like as رُسْلٌ is of رُسُلٌ. (Z.) You say, حُمِلَ فُلَانٌ
عَلَى البَرِيِد [Such a one was borne on the postmule or post-horse]. (S.) Imra-el-Keys speaks
of a بريد of the horses of Barbar. (S.) ―
-b2-  Having
been originally used in the sense first explained
above, it was afterwards applied to A messenger
borne on a post-mule [or post-horse]: (Z in the
Fáïk, and Mgh:) or messengers on beasts of the
post: (M, K:) or a messenger that journeys with
haste: (A:) or [simply] a messenger: (S, Msb,
K:) pl. as above. (M, * Z.) Hence the saying,
الحُمَّى بَرِيدُ المَوْتِ Fever is the messenger of
death: (T, Msb:) because it gives warning thereof.
(T.) Hence also البَرِيدُ applied to The animal
called الفُرَانِقُ, (said to be the jackal, but some say
otherwise, TA,) because he gives warning before
[the approach of] the lion. (T, S, K.) And
صَاحِبُ البَرِيِد [The master of the messengers that
journey on post-mules or post-horses]. (S.) [And
خَيْلٌ البَرِيِد, occurring in many histories &c., The
post-horses, that carry messengers and others.] ―
-b3-
Also, having been applied to a messenger on a
post-mule [or post-horse], it then became applied
to The space, or distance, traversed by the messenger thus called; (Mgh, Msb; *) the space, or
distance, between each سِكَّة and the سِكَّة next to it;
the سكّة being a structure of either of the kinds
called بَيْت and قُبَّة, or a رِبَاط [explained above],
in which the appointed messengers lodge; (Z in
the Fáïk;) the space, or distance, between two
