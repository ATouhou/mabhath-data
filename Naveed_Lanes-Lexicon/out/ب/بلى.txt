بَلَى is a particle; (S, Msb, Mughnee;) contr.
of لَا: (S:) not a noun: (Sb, S:) it is a replicative; (S, Mughnee;) an affirmative of what is
said [in that to which it is a reply]; (S, Msb;)
[with very few exceptions] relating only to a
negation, which it annuls: (Msb, Mughnee:)
the final letter is a radical: or, accord. to some,
the word is originally بَلْ, [after which an affirmation is to be understood,] and the final letter is
augmentative: and some of these say that this
letter is a denotative of the fem. gender, because
it is [often] pronounced with imáleh. (Mughnee.)
It is a reply to an interrogation in which is a
negative, (T, M, Msb, Mughnee, K,) and affirms
what is said to thee [in that interrogation]; (M,
K;) whether it be an interrogation in the proper
sense, (Mughnee,) as when you say to another,
أَلَمْ تَفْعَلْ كَذَا [Didst thou not such a thing?],
and he replies, بَلَى [meaning Yes, or yea, or ay,
I did], (T,) or as when one says, أَلَيْسَ زَيْدٌ بِقَائِمٍ
[Is not Zeyd standing?], and you reply, بَلَى
[Yes, he is]; or be meant to convey reproof,
(Mughnee,) as in the Kur [lxxv. 3 and 4],
أَيَحْسَبُ الإِنْسَانُ أَنْ لَنْ نَجْمَعَ عِظَامَهُ بَلَى [Doth
man think that we will not collect his bones?
Yes], (Msb, Mughnee,) i. e., we will collect
them; (Msb;) or be meant to make a person
confess, or acknowledge, a thing, (Mughnee,)
as in the Kur [vii. 171], أَلَسْتُ بِرَبِّكُمْ قَالُوا بَلَى
[Am I not your Lord? They said, Yea]. (M,
Mughnee.) It is also a reply to a simple negation, (Msb, Mughnee,) as when I say, مَا قَامَ
زَيْدٌ [Zeyd did not stand, or has not stood], and
you reply, بَلَى as an affirmative [meaning Yes,
he did, or he has]. (Msb.) It occurs in the Kur
[xxxix. 60], where it is said, بَلَى قَدْ جَآءَتْكَ آيَاتِى
[Yea, my signs have come to thee], preceded by
that which is not literally a negation, but which
has the force of a negation; for the preceding
saying, لَوْ أَنَّ اللّٰهَ هَدَانِى [If God had directed
me aright, or would that God &c.], is like the
saying, مَا هُدِيتُ [I was not directed aright].
(M.) It also occurs in the books of traditions,
in some instances, as a reply to an interrogation
without a negative; but these instances are rare,
and not to be followed in rendering revelation.
(Mughnee.) Az says that when a man says to
another, أَلَا تَقُومُ [Wilt thou not stand?], and the
latter replies, بَلَى, he means بَلْ أَقُومُ [Nay, I
will stand], adding the alif [written ى] to make
the pause good; for if he said, بَلْ, the other
would expect something more to be said after it.
(TA.) It is said that the pronunciation termed
imáleh is allowable in the case of بَلَى; and if so,
its final radical letter is ى: and some of the
grammarians say that this pronunciation of بلى
is because, by reason of its completeness and independence of meaning, so that it requires nothing
after it, it resembles independent nouns, in the
cases of which this pronunciation is allowable.
