pared (S, A, Msb, K) a hide, (S, A, Msb,) removing its بَشَرَة, (S,) or face, or surface, (A,
Msb,) or the skin upon which the hair grew:

with a large knife: or, accord. to Ibn-Buzurj,
some of the Arabs say, بَشَرْتُ الأَدِيمَ, aor.
بَشِرَ,
meaning I removed from the hide its بَشَرَة; and
↓ أَبْشَرْتُهُ as meaning I exposed to view its بَشَرَة
that was next to the flesh; and آدَمْتُهُ I exposed
to view its أَدَمَة upon which the hair grew. (TA.)
[But see أَدَمَةٌ.] ―
-b2-  Hence the saying in a trad.,
مَنْ أَحَبَّ القُرْآنَ قَلْيَبْشُرْ, accord. to him who
recites it thus, with damm to the ش; meaning
(assumed tropical:)  Whoso loveth the Kur-án, let him make himself
light of flesh, [by not eating more than will be
sufficient, and so prepare himself] for [reading,
or reciting,] it, [like as one prepares a horse for
running,] because eating much causes one to forget it. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Hence also, بَشَرَ الأَرْضَ, (TA,)
inf. n. as above, (S, K,) (assumed tropical:)  It (a swarm of locusts)
stripped the ground; (TA;) ate what was upon
the ground, (S, K,) i. e., upon its surface; as
though the exterior of the ground were its بَشَرَة.
(TA.) ―
-b4-  And بَشَرَ, aor.
بَشُرَ, (TA,) inf. n. as above,

↓ ابشر, [which is the most common, though extr.
in respect of analogy, as being quasi-pass. of بَشَرَ,
like احجم and احنج and اعرض and اقشع and

became changed in his بَشَرَة (or complexion) by

he rejoiced, or became rejoiced; (IAar, S, A,
Msb, K;) بِكَذَا [at, or by, such a thing; or at,
or by, the annunciation of such a thing]. (IAar,
S, K. *) You say, أَتَانِى أَمْرٌ بَشِرْتُ بِهِ An affair
happened to me whereat I rejoiced, or whereby
I became rejoiced. (S.) And بِمَوْلُودٍ ↓ أَبْشَرَ He
rejoiced [at the annunciation of a new-born child].
(S.) And بِخَيْرٍ ↓ أَبْشِرْ Rejoice thou [at the annunciation of a good event]. (S, K.) And in the
same sense ↓ أَبْشِرُوا is used in the Kur xli. 30.
(S.)

بشّرهُ (S, A, Msb, &c.,) the form used by

(TA,) or this last is a simple subst.; (Msb;)
and ↓ ابشرهُ; (S, A, Mgh, K;) and ↓ استبشرهُ; (K,
TA;) are syn.; (S, K, &c.;) originally signifying He announced to him an event which produced a change in his بَشَرَة [or complexion]: and
hence, (El-Fakhr Er-Rázee,) he announced to
him an event which rejoiced him: (A, El-Fakhr
Er-Rázee:) so in common acceptation [when not
restricted by an adjunct that denotes its having
a different meaning: see بُشْرَى and an ex. below
in this paragraph]: (El-Fakhr Er-Rázee:) or he
rejoiced him [by an annunciation]: (Msb:) and
he announced to him an event which grieved him:
[or he grieved him by an annunciation:] both
these significations are proper. (El-Fakhr Er-Rázee.) You say, بشّرهُ بِالأَمْرِ [generally meaning
He rejoiced him by the annunciation of the
event]; and بِهِ ↓ بَشَرَهُ, aor. and inf. ns. as above;
&c. (TA.) And بَشَّرْتُهُ بِمَوْلُودٍ [I rejoiced him by
the annunciation of a new-born child]. (S.) And it
is said in the Kur [iii. 20, &c.], بَشِّرْهُمْ بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ
[Grieve thou them by the annunciation, or denunciation, of a painful punishment]. (S.) You say
also, of a she-camel, بَشَّرَتْ بِاللَّقَاحِ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  She

(TA. [See also 4.])

TA) and بِشَارٌ, (TA,) He was, or became, in contact with the woman, skin to skin: (TA:) he
enjoyed [contact with] her skin: (Msb:) he
became in contact with her, skin to skin, both
being within one garment or piece of cloth: (K:)
he lay with her, [skin to skin; or in the sense of]
inivit eam: (S, K:) i. q. وَطِئَهَا, both فِى الفَرْجِ
and خَارِجًا مِنْهُ: (TA:) [and so ↓ بَشَرَهَا inf. n.
بَشْرٌ; for] بَشْرٌ and مُبَاشَرَةٌ are syn. [in the sense
of congressus venereus, as is shown by an ex. in
the S.]. (S, K.) ―
-b2-  باشرهُ النَّعِيمُ (tropical:)  [Enjoyment attended him; as though it clave to his skin]. (A.)
―
-b3-  فَبَاشَرُوا رَوْحَ اليَقِينِ, or رُوحَ اليقين, is a metaphorical expression, [app. meaning (tropical:)  And they
felt the joy and happiness that arise from certainty,] occurring in a trad. of 'Alee. (TA.) ―

superintended, managed, or conducted, the affair
himself, or in his own person: (S, K, TA:) or
(tropical:)  he was present, himself, at the affair: (A, TA:)
or, [properly,] he managed, or conducted, the
affair with his بَشَرَة, i. e., his own hand: (Mgh, *
Msb:) and hence a later application of the verb
in the sense of لَاحَظَ (assumed tropical:)  [He regarded, or attended
to, the thing, or affair, &c.]. (Msb.)
4
ابشر: see 1, first sentence, in two places. ―
-b2-
[Hence,] ابشر الأَمْرُ وَجْهَهُ The affair made his
countenance beautiful and bright: in the K we
read, أَبْشَرَ الأَمْرَ حَسَّنَهُ وَ نَضَّرَهُ; but this is a mistake.
(TA.) Agreeably with this explanation, AA renders a reading in the Kur [xlii. 22], ذٰلِكَ الَّذِى
يُبْشِرُ اللّٰهُ عِبَادَهُ, meaning That is it with which
God will make beautiful and bright the face of
his servants: so in the L. (TA.) ―

―
-b4-  [Hence,] أَبْشَرَتِ النَّاقَةُ (assumed tropical:)  The she-camel conceived, or became pregnant: (K:) as though she

part, in four places.

10

-A2-  استبشرهُ He
demanded of him a reward for an annunciation
of joyful tidings. (M.) ―
-b2-  See also 2.
بُشْرٌ: see بُشْرَى. ―
-b2-  It is also a contraction of
بُشُرٌ, which is pl. of بَشُورٌ (TA) or بَشِيرٌ. (TA in
art. نشر.)
بِشْرٌ Cheerfulness, or openness and pleasantness,
of countenance: (Mgh, Msb, K, * TA:) and happiness, joy, or gladness. (Har p. 192.) You say,
هُوَ حَسَنُ البِشْرِ He is cheerful, or open and pleasant, in countenance. (S.)
بَشَرٌ: see بَشَرَةٌ ―
-b2-  [Hence,] البَشَرُ (assumed tropical:)  Mankind:
(S, Msb, K:) and the human being: (Msb, K:)
applied to the male and to the female; and used
alike as sing. and pl. (Msb, K, TA) and dual:
(TA:) so that you say, هُوَ بَشَرٌ He is a human
being, and هِىَ بَشَرٌ She is a human being, and
هُمْ بَشَرٌ They (more than two) are human beings,
and هُمَا بَشَرٌ They two are human beings: (TA:)
but sometimes it has the dual form; (Msb, K;)
as in the Kur xxiii. 49; (Msb, TA;) though the
Arabs may have used the dual form in the sense
of the sing.: (MF:) and sometimes it has a pl.,
namely, أَبْشَارٌ. (K.) This is a secondary application of the word: (Msb:) i. e., this signification
is tropical; or, as some say, the word is so much
used in this sense as to be, so used, conventionally
regarded as proper; the sense not depending upon
its having another word connected with it: but
in the S and K, and by the generality of authors,
this signification is given as proper. (MF.) Some
say that a human being is thus called because his
بَشَرَة is bare of hair and of wool. (MF.) [Hence,]
أَبُو البَشَرِ [The father of mankind; meaning]
Adam. (K.)
بَشَرَةٌ (Lth, S, M, A, Mgh, Msb) and ↓ بَشَرٌ, (S,
K,) or the latter is pl. of the former, (Msb, K,)
[or rather a coll. gen. n., of which the former is
the n. un.,] like قَصَبَهُ and قَصَبٌ, (Msb,) and أَبْشَارٌ
is pl. of بَشَرٌ, (K,) [The external skin; the cuticle,
or scarf-skin; the epidermis;] the exterior of the
skin (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K) of a human being;
(S, A, K;) and, as some say, of other creatures,
(K,) such as the serpent; but this is generally
disallowed: (TA:) or بَشَرَةٌ signifies the exterior
of the skin of the head, in which grows the hair;
as also أَدَمَةٌ and شَوَاةٌ: (Aboo-Safwán:) or the
upper skin (Lth, M) of the head (M) and of the
face and body of a human being; (Lth, M;) that
upon which the hair grows: (M:) or, as some
say, that which is next the flesh. (M.) It is said
in a prov., إِنَّمَا يُعَاتَبُ الأَدِيمُ ذُو البَشَرَةِ: see أَدِيمٌ.
―

hue: and fineness, or delicacy. (TA.)
-A2-  بَشَرَةُ

of the earth. (S, A, K.) You say, مَا أَحْسَنَ بَشَرَتَهَا
(tropical:)  How goodly is its herbage appearing upon its
surface! (S, A.) And بَشَرَةٌ [alone] signifies (tropical:)  Leguminous plants; herbs, or herbage. (TA.) ―
-b2-
بَشَرَةٌ is used also as signifying (assumed tropical:)  A man's hand.
(Msb.) [See 3, last sentence.]
بُشْرَى (imperfectly decl., because it terminates
with a fem. alif which is inseparable from it, S)
and ↓ بِشَارَةٌ and ↓ بُشَارَةٌ [but respecting this last
see بِشَارَةٌ below] (S, Msb, K) and ↓ بُشْرٌ (Msb)
are substs. from بَشَّرَهُ (S, Msb, K) [originally
signifying An annunciation which produces a
change in the بَشَرَة (or complexion) of the person
to whom it is made: and hence, a joyful annunciation; joyful, or glad, tidings; good news]:
and ↓ تَبَاشِيرُ [q. v. infrà] signifies the same as
بُشْرَى: (S, K:) ↓ بِشَارَةٌ, when used absolutely,
relates only to good; (S, Msb;) not to evil unless
when expressly restricted thereto by an adjunct:
[see 2:] (S:) its pl. is بِشَارَاتٌ and بَشَائِرُ. (A.)
يَا بُشْرَاىَ, in the Kur [xii. 19, accord. to one reading, (otherwise, as Bd mentions, بُشْرَاىْ, or بُشْرَىَّ,
which is a dial. var. of the same, or بُشْرَى, which,
as some say, was the name of a man,) meaning
O my joyful annunciation, or joyful tidings, or
good news!], is like عَصَاى: and in the dual you
say, يَا بُشْرَيَىَّ. (S.) You say also, ↓ تَتَابَعَتِ البِشَارَاتُ
and البَشَائِرُ [The joyful annunciations followed consecutively]. (A.) See another ex. voce بَشِيرٌ. ―

بَشِيرٌ i. q. ↓ مُبَشِّرٌ, (S, Mgh, K,) [and so ↓ بَشُورٌ,
as will be seen by an ex. in what follows,] One
who announces to a people [or person] an event,
either good or evil; (TA;) but meaning the
former oftener than the latter: (Msb:) [an announcer of a joyful event, or joyful events: one
who rejoices another, or others, by an annunciation:] pl. بُشَرَآءُ (A) and بُشُرٌ, (TA in art. نشر,)
or this is pl. of ↓ بَشُورٌ. (TA in the present art.)
It is said in the Kur [vii. 55], وَ هُوَ الَّذِى يُرْسِلُ
الرِّيَاحَ بُشُرًا, and بُشْرًا, and ↓ بُشْرَى, and بَشْرًا;
[accord. to different readings, meaning (assumed tropical:)  And He
it is who sendeth the winds announcing coming
rain;] in which بُشُرٌ is pl. of ↓ بَشُورٌ, [syn. with
بَشِيرٌ and مُبَشِّرٌ, but both masc. and fem.,] (TA,)
or of بَشِيرٌ, (Bd,) or of بَشِيرَةٌ; (TA in art. نشر;)
and بُشْرًا is a contraction of the same; and بُشْرَى
is syn. with بِشَارَةٌ; and بَشْرًا is the inf. n. of بَشَرَهُ
in the sense of بَشَّرَهُ (TA. [But the reading
commonly followed in this passage is نُشُرًا, with
ن: another reading is نُشْرًا: another, نَشْرًا: and
another, نَشَرًا.]) And ↓ المُبَشِّرَاتُ, (A,) or مُبَشِّرَاتُ
الرِّيَاحِ, (S,) signifies (tropical:)  Winds that announce
[coming] rain: (S, A:) so in the Kur xxx. 45.

form or features; (S, K;) applied to a man, and
to a face: (TA:) fem. with ة; (S, K;) applied
to a woman, and to a she-camel; (S;) and meaning, when applied to a she-camel, neither emaciated nor fat: or, accord. to Aboo-Hilál, neither
of generous nor of ignoble breed: or, as some say,
half-fattened: (TA:) pl. of the fem. بَشَائِرُ: (S:)
and ↓ مَبْشُورَةٌ signifies beautiful in make and
colour; (IAar, K;) applied to a girl. (IAar.)
بَشَارَةٌ Goodliness; beauty; elegance of form or

عَامِل, has this signification; (IAth;) and so ↓ بُشْرَى;
(M;) and بِشَارَةٌ [has the same meaning accord. to common usage, but, properly,] is a subst. in the sense
explained above, voce بُشْرَى. (IAth.) You say,
أَعْطَيْتُهُ ثَوْبِى بِشَارَةً I gave him my garment as a
reward for the joyful annunciation. (TA from a

of El-Hajjáj, تَبْشِيرٌ occurs as meaning (assumed tropical:)  the commencement of rain. (TA.) One says, فِيهِ مَخَايِلُ
