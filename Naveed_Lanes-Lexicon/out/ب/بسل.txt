said of milk, and of نَبِيذ [or must &c.], (tropical:) It was,

erroneously put for بَسَلَ; and وَبَسَّلَهُ, which should
next follow, is omitted:]) or, said of the former,
it was, or became, displeasing, or odious, in taste,
and sour; and, said of the latter, it was, or
became, strong, and sour. (M, TA.) Also, said

-A3-  بِسُلَ,
[aor.
بَسُلَ,] inf. n. بَسَالَةٌ (S, M, Msb, K) and بَسَالٌ,
[respecting which latter see what follows in the
next sentence,] (M, K,) He was, or became, courageous, or strong-hearted, on the occasion of war,
or fight: (S, M, Msb, K:) from بَسْلٌ meaning
“forbidden,” or “prohibited;” because he who
has this quality defends himself from his antagonist, as though it were forbidden to him [the
latter] to do him a displeasing, or an evil, deed.
(Ham p. 13.) El-Hoteíah says,
وَأَحْلَى مِنَ التَّمْرِ الجَنِىِّ وَ فِيهِمُ
بَسَالَةُ نَفْسٍ إِنْ أُرِيدَ بَسَالُهَا
[And sweeter than fresh-gathered dates, and in
them is courageousness of soul, if courageousness
thereof be desired]: but بسالها may be here altered
by curtailment from بَسَالَنُهَا. (M.) You say, مَا
أَبْيَنَ بَسَالَتَهُ [How manifest is] his courage! (TA.)
