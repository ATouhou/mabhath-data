بطرقبِطْرِيقٌ A قَائِد [or leader of an army], in the
language of the رُوم [or Greeks of the Lower
Empire]; (JK;) one who is to the روم like the
قائد to the Arabs; (Mgh, Msb;) [i. e.] a leader
of an army (قائد) of the روم; (S, K;) accord.
to Kudámeh, (Mgh,) one who is over ten thousand men: (Mgh, K:) next to him is the طَرْخَان
[in the CK تَرْخان], over five thousand: then,
the قَوْمَس, over two hundred: (K:) but in art.
طرخ in the K, it is said that طرخان signifies “ a
headman, or chief, of high, or noble, rank,” in
the language of Khurásán; and in art. قمس,
that قومس signifies “ a commander,” or the like,
syn. أَمِيرٌ; and. قَمَامِسَةٌ, i. q. بَطَارِقَةٌ, (TA,) which
is pl. of بطريق, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) as also بَطَارِيقُ,
for which بَطَارِقُ is used in a verse of Aboo-Dhueyb: (TA:) it is an arabicized word; (S, TA;)
[app. from the Latin “ patricius; ”] or, as some
say, of the language of the روم and of Syria: or
Arabic, agreeing with the foreign word, and of
the dial. of the people of El-Hijáz: accord. to
El-Jawáleekee and others, in the language of the
روم it is بترك: some say that it signifies skilled
in war and its affairs, in the language of the
روم; and he who is so has rank, or office, and
is sometimes made foremost, among them: (TA:)
and (some say, TA) a proud and self-conceited
man; (JK, K;) so says Ibn-'Abbád: (TA:)
and fat; applied to a bird (JK, K) &c.: (JK:)
pl. بَطَارِقَةٌ. (K.) ―
