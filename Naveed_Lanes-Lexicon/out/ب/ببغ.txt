ببغبَبْغَآءُ (Msb, K) and بَبَّغَآءُ (K, Kzw) [in modern
vulgar Arabic بَبَغَان, The parrot;] a certain
well-known bird; (Msb;) a certain green bird,
(Sgh, K, TA,) well known; (TA;) the bird
called in Persian طُوطِي, beautiful in colour and
form, mostly green, but in some instances red,
and yellow, and white; having a thick bill and
tongue: it hears the speech of men and repeats
it, without knowing its meaning; and utters
letters rightly: when they desire to teach it,
they put a mirror in its cage, so that it sees
therein its own form, and they speak to it from
behind the mirror, and when it hears, it repeats,
desiring to do as its like; and thus it learns
quickly: one of the wonders relating to it is
[said to be this], that it never drinks water; for
if it drank, it would die: (Kzw:) the affix renders
fem. the word, but not the thing named thereby,
like the ة in حَمَامَةٌ and نَعَامَةٌ; for the word
applies to the male and the female, so that
one says, بَبْغَآءُ ذَكَرٌ [a male parrot] and بَبْغَآءُ أُنْثَى
[a female parrot]: and the pl. is بَبْغَاوَاتٌ [or
بَبَّغَاوَاتٌ], like as صَحْرَاوَتٌ is pl. of صَحْرَآءُ.
