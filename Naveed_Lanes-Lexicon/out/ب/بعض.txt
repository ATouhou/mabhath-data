بَعَضَهُ البَعُوضُ, [aor.
بَعَضَ,] inf. n. بَعْضٌ, The
بَعُوض [or gnats, or musquitoes,] bit him; and
annoyed, or molested, him. (TA.) And بُعِضُوا
They were bitten by the بَعُوض: (A:) or were
annoyed, or molested, thereby. (K.) بَعَضَهُ is not
used in relation to anything but بَعُوض. (TA.)
A poet says, praising a man who passed the night
within a كِلَّة [or thin curtain used for protection
from gnats, or musquitoes], which is also called
أَبُو دِثَارٍ,
لَنِعْمَ البَيْتُ بَيْتُ أَبِى دِثَارٍ
إِذَا مَا خَافَ بَعْضُ القَوْمِ بَعْضَا
[Excellent indeed is the tent, the tent of Aboo-Dithár, when some of the people fear biting, and
annoyance, or molestation, from gnats, or musquitoes]: by بعضا meaning عَضًّا. (TA.)
2
بعضهُ, inf. n. تَبْعِيضٌ, He divided it into
parts, or portions, (S, A, Msb, K,) distinct, or
separate, one from another. (Msb) You say,
أَخَذُوا مَالَهُ فَبَعَّضُوهُ They took his property and
divided it into parts, or portions. (A, TA.)
And عَضَّى الشَّاةَ وَ بَعَّضَهَا [He limbed, or dismembered, the sheep, or goat, and divided it into
parts, or portions]. (A, TA.) [Hence,] مِنْ in
certain cases, and بِ in the like cases, as in the
saying شَرِبْتُ بِمَآءِ كَذَا [“ I drank of,” i. e. “ some
of, such water ”], are said to be لِلتَّبْعِيضِ [For the
purpose of dividing into parts, or portions].
(Msb.)
4
ابعضوا They had بَعُوض [or gnats, or musquitoes], (K,) or abundance thereof, (A,) in their
land. (A, K.)
5
تبعّض It was, or became, divided into parts,
or portions. (S, K.)
بَعْضٌ Some, or somewhat or some one, (lit. a
thing,) of things, or of a thing: Th says that it
signifies thus accord. to all the grammarians;
(Msb, TA;) except Hishám, as will be seen hereafter: (TA:) or a part, or portion, (A, Msb,
K,) of a thing, (Msb,) or of anything; (A, K;)
whether little or much: (TA:) accord. to both
these explanations, it may denote the greater part;
as eight of ten: (Msb:) [thus it signifies some
one or more; and it relates to persons and to
other things:] pl. أَبْعَاضٌ; (S, IJ, K;) but ISd
doubts whether IJ had an authority for this.
(TA.) You say, بَعْضُ الشَّرِّ أَهْوَنُ مِنْ بَعْضٍ [Some
kinds of evil are easier to be borne than some].
(A.) And جَارِيَةٌ حُسَّانَةٌ يُشْبِهُ بَعْضُهَا بَعْضًا [A very
beautiful girl, parts of whom resemble other parts].
(A.) [And ضَرَبَ بَعْضُهُمْ بَعْضًا Some of them beat
some; i. e. they beat one another.] And لَبِثْنَا يَوْمًا
أَوْ بَعْضَ يَوْمٍ [We have tarried a day or part of
a day]. (Kur xviii. 18.) And one says to a man
of a company of men, “Who did this? ” and he
answers, أَحَدُنَا or بَعْضُنَا [Some one of us]; meaning himself. (A.) The article ال should not be
prefixed to it, (K, * TA,) because it is originally a
prefixed n., and as such determinate either literally or virtually, so that it does not admit another
cause of being determinate; (TA;) contr. to what
is said by IDrst (K, TA) and Ez-Zejjájee; for
they said البَعْضُ and الكُلُّ; which, properly, as
ISd says, is not allowable; and it is said in the
O that IDrst, in this matter, was at variance with
all the people of his age: (TA:) AHát says that
the Arabs did not say الكُلُّ nor البَعْضُ, but that
people used these expressions, even Sb and Akh
in their two books, by reason of their little knowledge in this way: (K, * TA:) a remark, says MF,
which is extr., and needs no comment: (TA:)
[for who surpassed Sb and Akh in knowledge
respecting matters of this kind?] AHát also relates
his having told As that he had seen in the book
of [that celebrated and chaste author] Ibn-ElMukaffa', العِلْمُ الكَثِيرٌ وَ لٰكِنَّ أَخْذَ البَعْضِ خَيْرٌ مِنْ
تَرْكِ الكُلِّ [Science is large; but the acquiring of
part is better than the neglecting of the whole];
and that As disapproved of it most strongly,
saying that the article ال is not prefixed to بَعْضٌ
and كُلٌّ because they are determinate without it:
(TA:) Az, however, says that the grammarians
allow its being prefixed to these two words,
(Msb, TA,) though As disallows it, (TA,) because they are meant to be understood as prefixed
ns.; (Msb;) or because the article is meant to
be a substitute for the noun to which they should
be prefixed; or, in the case of بَعْضٌ, because this
word is equivalent to جُزْءٌ, which receives the
article ال. (MF.) It is related of AO, that he
assigned also to بَعْضٌ the contr. meaning of All;
or the whole: adducing as a proof thereof the
words of the Kur [xl. 29], يُصِبْكُمْ بَعْضُ الَّذِى
يَعِدُكُمْ as meaning All of that with which he
threateneth you will befall you: and the saying
of Lebeed.
أَوْ يَعْتَلِقْ بَعْضَ النُّفُوسِ حِمَامُهَا
[as meaning Or their death shall cling to all
living creatures: or, accord. to another relation,
او يَرْتَبِطْ, which means the same as او يعتلق]:
thus also AHeyth explains the above-cited verse
of the Kur; and thus Hishám explains the saying
of Lebeed, erroneously asserting that بعض is here
a pl.: (TA:) but with respect to the former
instance, the Prophet had threatened them with
two things, the punishment of the present world
and that of the world to come; so he says, “This
punishment will befall you in the present world; ”
which is part (بعض] of the two threats; without
denying the punishment of the world to come:
or, as Aboo-Is-hák says, he mentions the part to
indicate the necessary consequence of the whole:
and as to the saying of Lebeed, by بعض النفوس
he means himself. (TA [app. from ISd].)
أَرْضٌ بَعِضَةٌ A land abounding with بَعُوض [or
gnats, or musquitoes]; (K;) as also ↓ مَبْعَضَةٌ,
like as you say مَبَقَّةٌ. (TA.) And لَيْلَةٌ بَعِضَةٌ A
night in which are many بَعُوض; as also ↓ مَبْعُوضَةٌ
(A, K.)
بَعُوضٌ [Gnats, or musquitoes;] i. q. بَقَّ [which
signifies both gnats, or musquitoes, (called in
Egypt نَامُوس,) and also bugs]: n. un. with ة:
(S:) or pl. of بَعُوضَةٌ, (K,) which signifies i. q.
بَقَّةٌ. (A, K.) A poet speaks of the humming of
the بعوض of the water. (TA.) The author of
the K says, in the B, that the word is taken from
بَعْضٌ, because of the smallness of the body of the
بعوضة in comparison with other living things.
(TA.) You say, كَلَّفَنِى مُخَّ البَعُوضِ (tropical:) He imposed upon me a difficult thing: (A:) or an
impossible thing. (TS, K.)
