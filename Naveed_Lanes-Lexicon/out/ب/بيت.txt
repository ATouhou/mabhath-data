بيت1
بَاتَ, (T, S M, &c.,) aor. يَبِيتُ and يَبَاتُ, (S,
Msb, K,) inf. n. بَيْتُوتَةٌ (Lth, T, S A, Msb, K) and
مَبِيتٌ (Msb, K) and مَبَاتٌ (Msb) and بَيْتٌ and
بَيَاتٌ, (K,) has two meanings: in that which more
commonly obtains, the action is restricted to the
night: (Msb:) it is by night, or in night; not
in sleep: (M:) you say, بَاتَ يَفْعَلُ كَذَا, meaning
He did such a thing by night, or at night: (S,
Msb, K:) [or he was in the night, or at night, or
during the night, doing such a thing: and he
passed, or spent, the night, or a night, or a part
thereof, or, as will be seen below, he entered upon
the night, doing such a thing:] like as one says,
ظَلَّ يَفْعَلُ كَذَا as meaning “ he did such a thing
by day,” or “ at day-time: ” (S, Msb;*) IKoot
and Es-Sarakustee and IKtt say that it has this
meaning, and not “ he slept: ” (Msb:) [F adds,]
وَ لَيْسَ مِنَ النَّوْمِ, (K,) which is said to mean, “and
the action is not one of sleep; ” so that when one
sleeps by night, or at night, it is not correct to
say, بَاتَ يَنَامُ: or, accord. to some, “its meaning
is not that of sleeping; ” so that one may say,
بَاتَ زَيْدٌ نَائِمًا [Zeyd was in the night, &c., or
passed, or spent, the night, &c., sleeping]: (MF:)
[Fei says,] it is only when one remains awake in
the night: and hence the saying in the Kur
[xxv. 65], وَالَّذِينَ يَبِيتُونَ لِرَّبِهِمْ سُجَّدًا وَقِيامًا [And
those who pass the night prostrating themselves to
their Lord and standing up in prayer]: (Msb:)
Fr says that بَاتَ الرَّجُلُ means The man remained
awake all the night, engaged in acts of obedience or
of disobedience: (T, Msb:) [or it means the man
entered upon the night; or he was in the night, or at
night, or during the night, in any state, or engaged
in any action; for] Zj says, (M,) بَاتَ is said of
any one whom the night has overtaken, (M, K, *)
whether he have slept or not slept: (M:) and
Lth says, البَيْتُوتَةُ signifies the entering upon the
night: one says, بِتُّ أَصْنَعُ كَذَا وَ كَذَا [I entered
upon the night doing such and such things]: and
he adds, (T,) he who says بَاتَ as meaning he
slept commits an error; for you say, بِتُّ أُرَاعِى
النُّجُومَ [I entered upon, or passed, the night]
looking at the stars: and how can he be sleeping
who is looking at them? (T, Msb:) but Mullà
'Abd-El-Hakeem, in his Commentaries on the
Mutowwal, says that بَاتَ sometimes means he
remained, continued, stayed, or dwelt, and he
alighted and abode, by night, or at night, whether
he slept or not: (MF:) and Ibn-Keysán says
that it may be used in the same manner as نَامَ [he
slept]; and also, [as will be explained below,] in
the same manner as كَانَ. (TA.) You say, بَاتَ
بَيْتُوتَةً صَالِحَةً (T) or طَيِّبَةً (A) [He passed, or
entered upon, the night, or a night, in a good
manner]. And بِتُّ القَوْمَ and بِتُّ بِهِمْ and بِتُّ
عِنْدَهُمْ [I passed, or entered upon, the night, or a
night, with, or at the abode of, the people, or company of men: the last of these phrases is the most
common]. (A 'Obeyd, M, K.) ―
-b2-  Secondly, it is
used in the sense of صَارَ [He became]; (Msb;)
or in the same manner as كَانَ [he was]. (Ibn-Keysán, TA.) One says, بَاتَ بِمَوْضِعِ كَذَا He
became [or was] in such a place; whether in
night-time or in day-time. (Msb.) And hence
the saying of the lawyers, بَاتَ عِنْدَ امْرَأَتِهِ لَيْلَةً He
became [or was] with his wife one night; [which
is the same as he passed a night &c.; though this,
it will be observed, is not in this instance the
signification of the verb alone;] whether sleeping
or not. (Msb.) ―
-b3-  [Thus it is used both as a
“ complete,” i. e. an attributive, verb, and also as
an “ incomplete,” i. e. a non-attributive, verb.] ―
-b4-
بَاتَ, aor. يَبِيتُ, (T, A,) inf. n. بَيْتٌ, (T, M, K,)
also signifies (tropical:)  He married, or took a wife: (T,
A:) [see بَيْتٌ below:] or (assumed tropical:)  he gave in marriage;
syn. of the inf. n. تَزْوِيجٌ. (Kr, M, K.)
2
بيّت البَيْتَ He constructed, or built, the بَيْت
[i. e. tent, or house, &c.]. (M.)
-A2-  بيّت الأَمْرِ,
[inf. n. as below,] He did, or performed, the
thing, or affair, by night, or at night: (M:) and
he thought, or meditated, upon it, considering its
end, or issue, or result, (Zj, T, S, M, A, Msb, K,)
or entered into it, (Zj, T,) by night, or at night.
(Zj, T, S, M, &c.) And one says, بُيِّتَ بِلَيْلٍ, (T,
A,) meaning the same as دُبِّرَ بِلَيْلِ [It was thought,
or meditated, upon, &c., by night, or at night]:
(T:) [for] بُيِّتَ الشَّىْءُ also signifies [simply] the
thing was thought upon, and considered as to its
end, issue, or result; syn. قُدِّرَ. (S.) Accord. to
El-Marzookee, they say of a thing that is not
done deliberately, and with good consideration of
its issue or result, هٰذَا أَمْرٌ قُدِّرَ بِلَيْلٍ; [in the text
from which this is taken, without the syll. signs;]
and hence the saying in the Kur [iv. 83], بَيَّتَ
طَائِفَةٌ مِنْهُمْ غَيْرِ الَّذِى تَقُولُ [A part of them meditateth by night upon doing otherwise than that
which thou sayest; as is indicated in the M,
where this is cited; and in like manner, يُبَيِّتُونَ,
in the continuation of the same passage of the
Kur, is explained in the T as meaning يُدَبِّرُونَ,
and يُقَدِّرُونَ, (i. e. مِنَ السُّوْءِ,) لَيْلًا]: but Aboo-Hilál says that a thing is meditated upon in the
night in order that one may apply himself to it
with strong purpose, and not be diverted by other
things, so that it may be done with more firmness;
and he cites the same passage of the Kur. (Ham
p. 130.) And hence, in the Kur [iv. 108], إِذْ
يُبَيِّتُونَ مَا لَا يَرْضَى مِنَ القَوْلِ When they meditate,
&c., (S, M, Bd, Jel,) by night, (S, M,) [what He
will not approve, of speech,] and prepare it [in
their minds] (يُزَوِّرُونَهُ [see art. زور]). (Bd.) It
is said in a trad., لَا صِيَامَ لِمَنْ لَمْ يُبَيِّتِ الصِّيَامَ
There is no fasting to him [meaning his fasting is
null] who does not purpose it from the night.
(TA. [See another reading, voce بَتَّ.]) And
you say, بَيَّتَ النِّيَّةَ He decided upon the purpose,
or intention, by night, or in night-time. (Msb.)
And بَيَّتَ رَأْيَهُ He thought upon his opinion, and
concealed it, or conceived it, in his mind. (TA.)
―
-b2-  بَيَّتَهُمْ, (inf. n. تَبْيِيتٌ, (Msb, TA,) He came
upon them, (Mgh, but the verb is there pl.,) or
made a sudden attack upon them, and engaged
with them in conflict, (Msb,) or made a great
slaughter among them, or engaged with them in
vehement conflict, (S, M, K,) namely, the enemy,
(S, Mgh, K,) or a people, (M,) by night: (S,
M, Mgh, Msb, K:) he came upon them (the sons
of such a one) in the night, and made a sudden
attack upon them, while they were heedless: (T:)
he attacked them (the people of a house or place
of abode) by night: he went to them (the enemy)
in the night, without their knowledge, and took
them by surprise. (TA.) ―
-b3-  كَانَ لَا يُبَيِّتُ مَا لاًا وَلَا
يُقَيِّلُهُ He used not to retain property until night,
nor to retain it until noon, when it came to him;
but used to hasten the dividing of it. (TA, from
a trad.) ―
-b4-  See also 4.
-A3-  بيّت النَّخْلَ He trimmed,
or pruned, the palm-trees, by cutting off the stumps
of the branches, or by cutting off the straggling
branches, not in the best part thereof. (K.)
-A4-
See also 5.
4
اباتهُ, inf. n. إِبَاتَةٌ, He (God) made him, or
caused him, to pass, or spend, the night, [or a
part thereof,] or to enter upon the night. (T, M,
K.) You say, أَبَاتَكَ اللّٰهُ حَسَنَةً [May God make
thee to pass, or enter upon, the night with happiness], (S,) and إِبَاتَةً حَسَنَةً [in a good manner of
doing so]. (T, A.) And [in like manner,] ↓ بَيَّتَكَ
اللّٰهُ فِى عَافِيَةٍ [May God make thee to pass, or
enter upon, the night in health and safety]. (A.)
And أَبَاتَهُ اللّٰهُ أَحْسَنَ بِيتَةٍ God made him to pass,
or enter upon, the night in the best manner of
doing so. (M, K. *)
5
تبيّتهُ عَنْ حَاجَتِهِ [so in the TA and in a MS.
copy of the K: in the CK ↓ بَيَّتَهُ:] He withheld,
or debarred, him from the thing that he wanted.
(K.)
10
إِسْتَبْيَتَ [استبات seems to signify He asked for, or
required, بِيت, or بِيتَة i. e. food: (see مُسْتَبِيتٌ:)
and also to have the contr. signification; i. e. ―
-b2-
He possessed food: for you say,] لَا يَسْتَبِيتُ لَيْلَةً
He possesses not a night's food. (T, K.) And
لَا يَسْتَبِيتُ He has not food. (A.)
بَيْتٌ [signifies A tent; properly, having more
than one pole; but often applied without this
restriction: and also a house; a chamber; an
apartment; a closet; and the like]: a بَيْت is [a
tent] of [goats'] hair (شَعَر), (M, A, Mgh, Msb,
K,) or of wool: (Mgh:) a بيت of hair [i. e.
hair-cloth] is that kind [of tent] which has more
than one pole: the word is masc.: and applies to
small and large: (M:) tents of goats' hair are
peculiar to people of cold countries and of fertile
regions, where the goats have abundant hair; for
the goats of the Arabs of the desert have short
hair, not long enough to be spun: (T in art.
بنى:) a خِبَآء is a small بيت of wool or of hair:
a بيت is what is larger than a خبآء: next is the
مِظَلَّة, which is larger than the بيت; but the
term بيت is also applied to a مظلّة when it is
large and مُرَوَّق [i. e. furnished with a رِوَاق,
q. v.]: (T:) Ibn-El-Kelbee says that the Arabs
have six kinds of بيت; namely, a قُبَّة, which is
of skins, or tanned hides; a مِظَلَّة, of hair; a
خِبَآء, of wool; a بِجَاد, of soft hair (وَبَر); a خَيْمَة,
of trees; an أُقْنَة, of stone; and a سَوْط, of hair;
or this is the smallest of them: El-Baghdádee
says that the خباء is a بيت made of soft hair
(وَبَر), or of wool, or of hair [commonly so called]
(شَعَر), upon two poles, or three; and that a
بيت is [a tent] upon six poles, or more, to the
number of nine: in the Towsheeh it is said that
the term خباء is applied to a بيت of any kind:
(TA:) a بيت is also [a structure] of clay, or
tough or cohesive clay or earth; (A, K;) [and
of baked bricks; and of stone;] the name being
likewise applied to a structure of a kind other
than the structures which are called أَخْبِيَة [or
tents]; (M;) signifying a habitation [of any
kind; an abode; a dwelling]: (Msb:) a man's
house; syn. دَارٌ: (T:) [and particularly a chamber;
i. e.] a single roofed structure (Mgh, Kull) having
a place of entrance; مَنْزِلٌ being applied to what
comprises more than one [such] بيت, and a roofed
صَحْن [or vacant part, and a kitchen, inhabited
by a man with his family]; and دَارٌ, that which
comprises more than one [such] بيت and more
than one [such] مَنْزِل and a [court, or] صَحْن
without a roof: (Kull:) the pl. is بُيُوتٌ, (S, M,
K, &c.,) also pronounced بِيُوتٌ, (TA,) and أَبْيَاتٌ,
(S, M, K,) the latter a pl. of pauc.; (TA;) and
pl. pl. بُيُوتَاتٌ (M, Mgh, K) and أَبَايِيتُ (Sb, S,
M, K) and أَبْيَاوَاتٌ, (Fr, M, K,) which last is
extr.: (M:) the dim. is ↓ بُيَيْتٌ, also pronounced
↓ بِيَيْتٌ; (S, K;) and the vulgar say, بُوَيْتٌ, (S,)
which is not allowable. (K.) You say, هُوَ جَارِى
بَيْتَ بَيْتَ, (T, S, M,) He is my neighbour [tent
to tent, or house to house, i. e.,] by contiguity [of
our habitations]: بيت بيت being made indecl.
with fet-h for the termination because they are
two nouns made one: (S:) Sb says that some of
the Arabs make them [thus] indecl., like خَمْسَةَ
عَشَرَ, and some make the former a prefixed noun
governing the latter in the gen. case, [saying
بَيْتَ بَيْتٍ,] except when used as a denotative of
state: (M:) one says also, بَيْتًا لِبَيْتٍ, and بَيْتٌ
لِبَيْتٍ; (Fr, T;) which last, or بَيْتٌ إِلَى بَيْتٍ, is
the original form. (Har p. 353.) بَنَى فُلَانٌ عَلَى
امْرَأَتِهِ [lit. Such a one constructed a tent over
his wife,] means such a one had his wife conducted
to him on the occasion of his marriage, and brought
her, or had her brought, into a pitched tent, having
conveyed thither the utensils and furniture and
other things that they required. (T.) And أَهْلُ
بَيْتُ النَّبِىِّ [The people of the house of the Prophet,]
means the Prophet's wives and his daughter and
'Alee: and so أَهْلَ الْبَيْتِ [i. e. يَخُصُّ أَهْلَ البَيْتِ
He means particularly, or peculiarly, the people
of the house], in the Kur xxxiii. 33: بَنُو and مَعْشَر
and أَهْل and آل, as prefixed nouns, being, as Sb
says, the nouns most frequently occurring in the
accus. case [for the reason indicated above, or,
as the Arabian grammarians express it,] عَلَى
الاِخْتِصَاصِ. (M.) ―
-b2-  It also signifies A [pavilion, palace, or mansion, such as is called] قَصْر:
(T, K:) whence the saying of Gabriel, بَشِّرْ خَدِيجَةَ
بِبَيْتٍ مِنْ قَصَبٍ, i. e. [Rejoice thou Khadeejeh by
the announcement of] a pavilion (قصر) of hollow
pearls, (T, TA,) or of emerald. (TA. [See also art.
قصب.]) بُيُوتًا غَيْرَ مَسْكُونَةٍ [Uninhabited houses],
in the Kur xxiv. 29, means buildings for the
reception of travellers, or for merchants and
their goods, and the shops of the merchants and
places in which things are sold, the entering of
which is allowed by their owners: or ruins which
a man enters for the purpose of easing nature.
(M.) And the بُيُوت which God has permitted
to be raised, mentioned in the same chapter,
verse 36, are Mosques, or places of worship: or,
accord. to El-Hasan, Jerusalem (بَيْتُ المَقْدِسِ);
the pl. being applied to it as a mark of honour.
(Zj, M.) البَيْتُ [The House] applies particularly
to (tropical:)  the Kaabeh [of Mekkeh]; (K;) as also بَيْتُ اللّٰهِ
[the House of God]; (AAF, M;) and البَيْتُ
الحَرَامُ [the Sacred House]; (T;) and البَيْتُ
العَتِيقُ [the Ancient House]; (S and K &c. in
art. عتق;) and accord. to some, البَيْتُ المَعْمُورُ,
q. v. (Bd in lii. 4.) [بَيْتُ المَالِ signifies The
treasury of the state. And بَيْتُ المَآءِ is a euphemism for The privy; because water is put there
for the purpose of ablution: also called بَيْتُ الفَرَاغِ,
&c.] ―
-b3-  Also (assumed tropical:)  The ark of Noah: so in the Kur
lxxi. last verse. (T.) ―
-b4-  (tropical:)  A grave; (M, IAth, K;)
app. by way of comparison. (M.) So in a trad.
of Aboo-Dharr: كَيْفَ تَصْنَعُ إِذَا مَاتَ النَّاسُ حَتَّى
يَكُونُ البَيْتُ بِالوَصِيفِ, meaning How will thou do
when men shall die so that the grave shall be sold
for the [servant-] boy? (IAth.) ―
-b5-  (assumed tropical:)  The habitation of the سُرْفَة, which it constructs in a beautiful
manner, (A'Obeyd, M,) of fragments of sticks;
(Yaakoob, M;) and of the صَيْدَنَانِىّ, which it
makes in the interior of the earth, and covers over:
(A'Obeyd, M:) and (assumed tropical:)  the burrow, or hole, of the
ضَبّ &c.: and (assumed tropical:)  the web of the spider: all, app.,
as being likened to the بَيْت of a man. (M.) ―
-b6-
(tropical:)  A man's household. (S, K, TA.) ―
-b7-  (tropical:)  The wife
(As, IAar, T, M, A) of a man. (M, A.) So in
the saying,
أَكِبَرٌ غَيَّرَنِى أمْ بَيْتُ
[Hath old age altered me, or a wife?]: (As, T:)
or here it means a household. (S.) ―
-b8-  The nobility
of the Arabs; (T, Msb, K; *) as when one says,
بَيْتُ تَمِيمٍ فِى بَنِى حَنْظَلَةَ [The nobility of Temeem
is in the sons of Handhaleh]: (T, Msb: *) or the
family that comprises the nobility of a tribe; as
آلُ حِصْنٍ of the فَزَارِيُّون, and آلُ الجُدَّيْنِ of the
شَيْبَانِيُّون, and آلُ عَبْدِ المَدَانِ of the حَارِثِيُّون;
which three were asserted by Ibn-El-Kelbee to
be the highest of the families thus called of the
Arabs: (M:) [see a verse of El-Lahabee cited
voce أَخْضَرُ:] pl. بُيُوتٌ and بُيُوتَاتٌ, (T, M,) the
latter being pl. of the former. (T.) You say,
هُوَ مِنْ أَهْلِ البُيُوتَاتِ He is of the people of nobility:
and مِنْ بَيْتٍ كَرِيمٍ [of a generous, or noble, house,
or family]. (A.) [See also بَنَى.] ―
-b9-  A noble
person: (M, Mgh, K:) pl. بُيُوتٌ and بُيُوتَاتٌ.
(Mgh.) You say, فُلَانٌ بَيْتُ قَوْمِهِ Such a one is
the noble person of his people. (Abu-l-'Omeythil
El-Aarabee, M.) ―
-b10-  (tropical:)  The [furniture termed]
فَرْش, (A, Mgh, K,) or مَتَاع, (TA,) of a tent or
house, (Mgh, K,) or that is sufficient for a tent
or house. (A.) You say, تَزَوَّجْتُ فُلَانَةَ عَلَى بَيْتٍ
(tropical:)  I married, or took as a wife, such a woman for
[my giving] furniture sufficient for a tent or
house, (A,) or furniture of a house or tent.
(Mgh.) [See 1, last sentence.] ―
-b11-  A بَيْت of
poetry, (T, S, M, Msb,) or of the poet, (K,) is
(tropical:)  [A verse; i. e.] what consists of certain known
divisions [or feet] called أَجْزَآءُ التَّفْعِيلِ; being
termed بيت metaphorically, because of the conjoining of its component parts, one to another, in
a particular manner, like as those of a tent are
conjoined in its construction; (Msb;) because it
consists of words collected together in a regular
manner, and so resembles a tent, which is composed of a سَقْف and كِفَآء and رِوَاق and عُمُد:
(T:) it is derived from the same word signifying
a خِبَآء [or tent], and applies to the small and the
great, as the رَجَز and the طَوِيل; and is [said to
be] thus called because it comprises words like as
the tent comprises its inhabitants; wherefore its
component parts are termed أَسْبَاب and أَوْتَاد, as
being likened to the اسباب and اوتاد of tents:
(M:) pl. أَبْيَاتٌ and بُيُوتٌ, (M, A, Msb,) the latter
mentioned by Sb and IJ, (M,) [but rare,] and
[pl. pl.] أَبَايِيتُ: (A:) Abu-l-Hasan says that if
the بيت of poetry be likened to the بيت which is
a tent or other kind of structure, there is no reason
why it should not have the same pl. forms as the
latter has. (L.) By the following words of a poet,
وَبَيْتٍ عَلَى ظَهْرِ المَطِىِّ بَنَيْتُهُ
بِأَسْمَرَ مَشْقُوقِ الخَيَاشِيمِ يَرْعُفُ
[Many a بيت upon the back of the camel have I
constructed with a lawny thing slit in the nose
and bleeding], is meant, many a بيت of poetry
have I written with the reed-pen. (S.) [البَيْتَ,
written after a quotation of a part of a verse of
poetry, means اِقْرَأِ البَيْتَ Read thou the verse.]
بَيْتُ القَصِيدَةِ [The chief verse of the poem] is a
phrase employed when a person composes a poem
in praise of any one from whom he would obtain
some object of desire and want, being applied to
that verse of the poem in which the author's want
is mentioned: and is a proverbial expression relating to that which is extraordinary and strange,
and used in denoting the superiority of a part of a
thing over the whole of it [regarded as a whole]:
[hence,] one says, فُلَانٌ أَوَّلُ الجَرِيدَةِ وَبَيْتُ القَصِيدَةِ
(assumed tropical:)  [Such a one is the first of the detachment of
horsemen, and the chief verse of the poem]. (Har
p. 441.)
بِيتٌ: see بِيتَةٌ, in two places.
بِيتَةٌ a subst. from بَاتَ: and signifying A manner or mode, and state, or condition, of passing,
or entering upon, the night. (M.) [See 4; last
sentence.]
-A2-  Food, or victuals; and so ↓ بِيتٌ:
(A, K:) [or particularly, of a night: for] you
say, لَيْلَةٍ ↓ مَا لَهُ بِيتُ, (S M, A, K.) and بِيتَةٌ لَيْلَةٍ,
(T, S, M, A,) مِنَ القُوتِ, (T,) He has not a night's
food, or victuals. (T, S, M, A, K.)
بَيَاتٌ A coming upon the enemy by night;
(Mgh;) a sudden attack upon, and conflict with,
the enemy by night; (Msb;) a great slaughter
(S, M) among the enemy, (S,) or a people, (M,)
and vehement conflict with them; (S, M;) a
coming upon people in the night, and making a
sudden attack upon them, while they are heedless;
(T;) an attack upon a people by night; a going
to the enemy in the night, without their knowledge,
and taking them by surprise: (TA:) a subst.
from 2; (S, M, Mgh, Msb;) like سَلَامٌ from
سَلَّمَ. (Mgh.) ―
-b2-  أَتَاهُمُ الأَمْرُ بَيَاتًا The thing, or
event, happened, or came, to them in the latter
part of the night. (T.)
بُيَيْتٌ, also pronounced بِيَيْتٌ, dim. of بَيْتٌ, q. v.
(S, K.)
بَيُّوتٌ That has remained throughout a night
[and so become stale; stale from being a night
old]; as also ↓ بَائِتٌ: both, in this sense, [but the
latter more usually,] applied to bread. (S, K.)
―
-b2-  Cold, or cool, water, (M, K,) that has become
so from its having remained throughout a night:
(M:) or water that remains during the night
beneath the sky: (Ham p. 553:) or water that
has been cooled in the leathern bag by night; and
in like manner, milk; for [Az says,] I heard an
Arab of the desert say, اِسْقِنِى مِنْ بَيُّوتِ السِّقَآءِ,
meaning Give thou me to drink of the milk that
has been milked at night and left in the skin so
that it has become cold, or cool, by night. (T.)
In the saying,
فَصَبَّحَتْ حَوضَ قِرًى بَيُّوتَا
the meaning seems to be, قِرَى حَوْضٍ بَيُّوتَا, i. e.,
[And they (app. camels) came in the morning to]
the collected water of a trough, which water had
remained throughout the night and so become
cold, or cool; the phrase being inverted. (M.) ―
-b3-
أَمْرٌ بَيُّوتٌ (assumed tropical:)  An affair, or event, for which, or on
account of which, one passes the night in anxiety
or grief. (S, K.) ―
-b4-  هَمٌّ بَيُّوتٌ (assumed tropical:)  Anxiety, or grief,
that has remained during the night in the bosom.
(M.) ―
-b5-  سِنٌّ بَيُّوتَةٌ A tooth that does not fall out,
or become shed. (K.)
