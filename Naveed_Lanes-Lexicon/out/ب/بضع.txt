بضع1
بَضَعَهُ, (S, Msb,) aor.
بَضَعَ, (Msb,) inf. n. بَضْعٌ,
(S, Mgh, Msb, K,) He cut it; (S, Mgh, Msb,
K;) namely, flesh, or flesh-meat: (S, TA:) and
it (a sword) cut a piece off from it; namely, a
thing: (As, S:) and he cut it in pieces; namely,
flesh, or flesh-meat: (K, TA:) and ↓ بضّعهُ, inf. n.
تَبْضِيعٌ, has the first of these significations: (K:
[but only the inf. n. is there mentioned:]) or this
latter signifies he cut it much, or in several pieces,
or in many pieces. (Msb, TA. *) ―
-b2-  He slit it;
or cut it lengthwise; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;) namely,
flesh, or flesh-meat, (Msb,) or a wound, (S, TA,)
and a vein, and a hide. (S.) ―
-b3-  [And hence,]
بَضَعَهَا, (Sb, Msb, TA,) aor.
بَضَعَ, (Msb,) inf. n. بَضْعٌ
(K, TA) and بُضْعٌ, like شُكْرٌ and شُغْلٌ and كُفْرٌ, for
فُعْلٌ is not rare as a measure of inf. ns., (Sb, TA,)
or accord. to some it is an inf. n. of this verb,
(Msb,) but accord. to others it is a simple subst.,
(TA,) (tropical:)  Inivit eam; he lay with her, or compressed
her; (Sb, Msb, K, TA;) as also ↓ باضعها, (Msb,)
inf. n. مُبَاضَعَةٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and بِضَاعٌ: (S,
Msb, K:) because in the act which it signifies is
a kind of slitting. (Mgh.) You say, مَلَكَ بُضْعَهَا,
i. e. جِمَاعَهَا. (Msb.) And it is said in a prov.,
↓ كَمُعَلِّمَةِ أُمَّهَا البِضَاعَ (tropical:)  [Like her who teaches her
mother المُجَامَعَة]. (S.) ―
-b4-  بَضْعٌ also signifies (tropical:)  The
taking in marriage: (K, TA:) and بُضْعٌ, as an
inf. n., (assumed tropical:)  The making a contract of marriage.
(Msb.)

ابضعها, (Mgh, Msb, K,) inf. n. إِبْضَاعٌ,
(Mgh, Msb,) (tropical:)  He gave her in marriage. (Mgh,
Msb, K.) It is said in a trad., (TA,) تُسْتَأْمَرُ
النِّسَآءُ فِى إِبْضَاعِهِنَّ (tropical:)  Women shall be consulted
respecting the giving them in marriage: (T,
Mgh, Msb, TA:) or, accord. to one relation,
↓ أَبْضَاعِهِنَّ, (Mgh, Msb,) which [virtually] means
the same; (Msb;) but this is a pl., namely, of
بُضْعٌ. (Mgh, Msb.)
-A2-  ابضع الشَّىْءَ He made the
thing to be بِضَاعَة [i. e. an article of merchandise], (S, K, TA,) whatever it was; (TA;) as
also ↓ استبضعهُ: (S, K:) or الشَّىْءَ ↓ اِسْتَبْضَعْتُ signifies I made [or took] the thing as بضاعة [an
article of merchandise] for myself: and you say,
أَبْضَعْتُهُ غَيْرِى [I made it, or gave it as, an article
of merchandise to another than me]: (Mgh,
Msb:) and ابضعهُ البِضَاعَةَ he gave him the article
of merchandise. (TA.) Hence the phrase, in a
trad. relating to El-Medeeneh, accord. to one
relation, تُبْضِعُ طِيبَهَا, meaning (assumed tropical:)  It gives the good
that it possesses to its inhabitants; as explained
by Z; but accord. to the relation commonly
known, it is تَنْصَعُ, with ن and with the unpointed ص; [meaning “it purifies;”; (L in art.
نصع;)] and there are two other relations, which
are تَنْضَخُ and تَنْضَخُ. (TA.)
7
انبضع It was, or became, cut, or cut off.
(K, TA.)
8
ابتضع مِنْهُ He took, or received, [merchandise] from him. (TA: [in which the word بِضَاعَةً
requires to be supplied in the explanation, and
is indicated by the context.])
10
اِسْتِبْضَاعٌ denotes a kind of matrimonial
connection practised by people in the Time of
Ignorance; i. e., A woman's desiring sexual intercourse with a man only to obtain offspring by
him: a man of them used to say to his female
slave or his wife, أَرْسِلِى إِلَى فُلَان فَآسْتَبْضِعِى مِنْهُ
[Send thou to such a one, and demand of him
sexual intercourse to obtain offspring]; and he
used to separate himself from her, and not touch
her, until her pregnancy by that man became
apparent: and this he did from a desire of obtaining generous offspring. (IAth, TA.)
-A2-  See also

بَضْعٌ: see بِضْعٌ, first sentence, and near the
end: and see also بَضْعَةٌ.
بُضْعٌ Initus; sexual intercourse: (Mgh, Msb,
K:) a subst., (Mgh, Msb, TA,) accord. to some;
but accord. to others, an inf. n.; (Msb;) held
by Sb to be the latter: (TA:) [see 1:] and
marriage; or the taking in marriage; syn. نِكَاحٌ;
(ISk, S, Msb, TA;) [which has also the first of
the meanings given above;] as in the phrase مَلَكَ
فُلَانٌ بُضْعَ فُلَانَةَ [explained above (see 1)]: (ISk,
S:) or, (K,) in this phrase, (Mgh,) (tropical:)  the pudendum muliebre; the vulva; (Az, Mgh, Msb, K, *
TA;) and so in the saying, in a trad., عُتِقَ بُضْعُكِ
فَاخْتَارِى (tropical:)  Thy vulva hath become freed, therefore
choose thou whether thou wilt remain with thy
husband or separate thyself from him; (TA;)
and in the saying, تُسْتَأْمَرُ النِّسَآءُ فِى أَبْضَاعِهِنَّ,
accord. to those who thus relate it, others saying
إِبْضَاعِهِنَّ; (see 4;) أَبْضَاعٌ being pl. of بُضْعٌ.
(Mgh, Msb.) ―
-b2-  Also (tropical:)  The marriage-contract.
(K.) ―
-b3-  And (tropical:)  A dowry; or gift given to, or
for, a bride: (K, TA:) pl. بُضُوعٌ. (TA.) So
in the saying of 'Amr Ibn-Maadee-Kerib,
وَفِى كَعْبٍ وَإِخْوَتِهَا كِلَابٍ
سَوَامِى الطَّرْفِ غَالِيَةُ البُضُوعِ
[And among Kaab, and their brethren Kiláb, are
females lofty in look, or] proud, and dear in
respect of dowries. (TA.) ―
-b4-  Also (assumed tropical:)  Divorce:
(Az, K:) thus having two contr. significations.
(K.) ―
-b5-  And (assumed tropical:)  The authority possessed over a
woman by her guardian who affiances her. (TA.)
―
-b6-  And (assumed tropical:)  An equal; particularly as a suitor in
a case of marriage: as in the saying, in a trad.,
هٰذَا البُضْعُ لَا يُقْرَعُ أَنْفُهُ (assumed tropical:)  This equal‘s marriage
shall not be refused, nor shall it be desired, or
wished for; he shall not be rejected. (TA.)
بِضْعٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K, &c.) and ↓ بَضْعٌ, (S,
Msb, K,) some of the Arabs pronouncing it with
kesr, (S, Msb,) [A number under ten; and an
odd number, meaning] a number between two
round, or decimal, numbers; (AZ, K;) from one
to ten [exclusive of the latter]; and from eleven
to twenty [exclusive of the latter]; so accord. to
Mebremán; (K;) i. e. Mohammad Ibn-'Alee
Ibn-Ismá'eel the Lexicologist, Mebremán being
his surname: (TA:) or from three to nine; (S,
Msb, K [in the first and last the ns.
being in the fem. gender; but in the second,
masc.];) so accord. to Katádeh; (Mgh;) from
three to less than ten: (Fr [the ns. of number in
the masc. gender]:) or not less than three nor more
than ten; (Sh [the first n. of number in the fem.
gender, and the second masc.];) from three to
ten: (Mgh [the ns. of number in the masc.
gender]:) or to seven: (Mujáhid, Mgh:) or to
five: (AO, K [the n. of number in the fem.
gender]:) or from one to four: (AO, O, K [the
ns. of number in the masc. gender]:) or to five;
an explanation ascribed to AO: (TA:) or from
four to nine; (ISd, K [the ns. of number fem.];)
and this is the signification preferred by Th:
(TA:) or it signifies five: (Mukátil [this n. of
number masc.]:) or seven; (Mukátil, K [in the
K this n. of number being fem.];) so accord. to
some: (AO:) or ten: (Ed-Dahhák [this n. of
number masc.]:) or an undefined number; غَيْرُ
مَحْدُودٍ; so says Sgh; [and the like is said in the
Msb;] in the K, erroneously, غَيْرُ مَعْدُودٍ; (TA;)
because it means a portion, (Sgh, K,) which is
undefined: (Sgh, TA:) it also signifies, with ten,
[in like manner; i. e. ten and a number under
ten; or the like: as] from thirteen to nineteen.
(Msb.) When used as signifying from three to
nine, (Mgh, Msb,) or to ten, or to seven, (Mgh,)
[or to signify some number under ten, without
another n. of number,] it is masc. and fem. without variation: (Mgh, Msb:) you say بِضْعُ رِجَالٍ
From three to nine [&c.] men: and بِضْعُ نِسْوَةٍ
from three to nine [&c.] women: (Msb:) and
بِضْعُ سِنِينَ from three to nine [&c.] years: (S:)
and فِى بِضْعِ سِنِينَ [in from three to nine, &c.,
years]: (Kur xxx. 3:) and فَلَبِثَ فِى السِّجْنِ بِضْعَ
سِنِينَ [And he remained in the prison from three
to nine, &c., years]. (Kur xii. 42.) But when
used to denote a number above ten, (Mgh, Msb,)
with a masc. n. it is with ة, (↓ بِضْعَة,) and with a
fem. n. it is without ة: (ISk, Mgh, Msb, K:)
you say بِضْعَةَ عَشَرَ رَجُلًا From thirteen to nineteen [&c.] men: and بِضْعَ عَشْرَةَ امْرَأَةً from thirteen
to nineteen [&c.] women: (S, Mgh, * TA:) like as
you say ثَلَاثَةَ عَشَرَ رَجُلًا and ثَلَاثَ عَشْرةَ امْرَأَةً.
(Mgh.) When you have passed the word denoting ten, (S, K,) [i. e.] to denote a number
above twenty, (Msb,) it is not used: (S, Msb,
K:) you do not say بِضْعٌ وَعِشْرُونَ, (S, K,) but
نَيِّفٌ وَعِشْرُونَ; and so in the cases of the remaining
numbers: (S:) or you do say بِضْعٌ وَعِشْرُونَ:
(Sgh, K:) accord. to AZ, (Msb,) you say بِضْعَةٌ
وَعِشْرُونَ رَجُلًا (Mgh, Msb, K) meaning Twenty
and odd men: (AZ, TA:) and بِضْعٌ وَعِشْرُونَ امْرَأَةً
(Mgh, Msb, K) meaning twenty and odd women:
(AZ, TA:) but not the reverse: (K:) ISd says,
we have not heard this, but there is no objection
to it: (TA:) and Fr says, بِضْعٌ is not mentioned
save with ten and twenty to ninety; (IB, K;)
not with what exceeds this: (IB:) you do not
say بِضْعٌ وَمِائَةٌ nor بِضْعٌ وَأَلْفٌ, (IB, K,) but مِائَةٌ
وَنَيِّفٌ [and أَلْفٌ وَنَيِّفٌ]: (IB:) it occurs in trads.
with عِشْرُونَ and with ثَلَاثُونَ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  بِضْعٌ and
↓ بَضْعٌ also signify A part, or portion, of the
night: (K:) a time thereof. (Lh.) You say,
مَضَى بِضْعٌ مِنَ اللَّيْلِ [A part, or portion, of the
night passed]. (TA.) J mentions it with ص [in
the place of ض]; and explains it by جَوْشٌ, q. v.
(TA.)
بَضْعَةٌ, (S, Msb, K,) with fet-h, other words of
like meaning being with kesr, as قِطْعَةٌ and فِلْذَةٌ
and فِدْرَةٌ, (S,) and sometimes with kesr, [↓ بِضْعَةٌ,]
(K,) and ↓ بُضْعَةٌ also is mentioned, (TA,) of
which the first is the most chaste, though EshShiháb asserts the second to be more common,
(TA,) A piece, or lump, or portion cut off; (TA;)
particularly of flesh, or flesh-meat, (S, Msb, K,)
in a compact, or collective, state: (TA:) pl.
↓ بَضْعٌ, [or rather this is a coll. gen. n., of which
بَضْعَةٌ is the n. un.,] and بِضَعٌ, (S, Msb, K,) as
some say, (S,) but this is disallowed by 'Alee
Ibn-Hamzeh, (TA,) [or it may be a correct pl. of
بِضْعَةٌ agreeably with analogy,] and بِضَاعٌ, and
بَضَعَاتٌ, (Msb, K,) and [quasi-pl. n.] بَضِيعٌ, which
is extr., like رَهِينٌ and كَلِيبٌ and مَعِيزٌ [&c.].
(TA.) Hence the saying [of Mohammad] in a
trad., فَاطِمَةُ بَضْعَةٌ مِنَّى يَرِيبُنِى مَا رَابَهَا وَيُؤْذِينِى مَا
آذَاهَا  (tropical:)  Fátimeh is a part of me: [that displeases
and disquiets me which has displeased and disquieted her, and that hurts me which has hurt
her:] or, accord. to one relation, he said بُضَيْعَةٌ
[a little part]. (TA.) One says also, إِنَّ فُلَانًا
لَشَدِيدُ البَضْعَةِ حَسَنُهَا meaning Verily such a one
is corpulent and fat. (TA.) ―
-b2-  See also بَضَعَةٌ.
بُضْعَةٌ: see بَضْعَةٌ.
بِضْعَةٌ: see بَضْعَةٌ: and, as a noun of number,
see بِضْعٌ, latter half of the paragraph.
بَضَعَةٌ The sound of cutting of swords: occurring
in the saying, سَمِعْتُ لِلسِّيَاطِ خَضَعَةً وَلِلسُّيُوفِ بَضَعَةً
I heard a sound of falling of the whips, and a
sound of cutting of the swords: (TA:) but in the
S and A in art. خضع, and by IB, خضعة and
بضعة are written خَضْعَةٌ and ↓ بَضْعَةٌ; and IB
explains the former as signifying the sounds of
swords; and the latter, the sounds of whips. (TA
in art. خضع.) [See also بَاضِعٌ.]
بِضَاعٌ [The giving and receiving merchandise;]
a subst. from أَبْضَعَهُ البِضَاعَةَ and اِبْتَضَعَ مِنْهُ; [or
rather an inf. n. of which the verb, بَاضَعَ, is not
used;] similar to قِرَاضٌ. (TA.)
بَضِيعٌ Flesh. (As, S.) You say, دَابَّةٌ كَثِيرَةُ
البَضِيعِ (As, S, TA) A beast abounding in what is
distinct from the rest of the flesh of the thigh:
n. un. with ة. (TA.) And رَجُلٌ خَاظِى البَضِيعِ
(As, S) A fat man. (TA.) And سَاعِدٌ خَاظى البَضِيعِ
[A fore arm, or an upper arm,] full of flesh.
(IB.) [See also بَضْعَةٌ, of which it is a quasipl. n.]
بِضَاعَةٌ Merchandise; or an article of merchandise; (TA;) a portion of one's property
which one sends for traffic; (S;) a portion of
property prepared for traffic, (Mgh, * Msb,) or
with which one traffics; from بَضْعٌ signifying the
act of “cutting,” or “cutting off;” and vulgarly
pronounced بُضَاعَةٌ: (TA:) pl. بَضَائِعُ. (Msb, TA.)
بَاضِعٌ A sword that cuts off a piece of a thing
that it strikes: (S, TA:) or a sharp, or cutting,
sword: (K:) or a sword that cuts everything:
(TA:) pl. بَضَعَةٌ: (K:) Fr says that بَضَعَةٌ signifies swords; and خَضَعَةٌ, whips: but some say
the reverse. (TA.) [See also بَضَعَةٌ above.] ―
-b2-
[See also the next paragraph.]
-A2-  [A broker who
acts as an intermediary between the sellers and
buyers of camels;] the same with respect to camels
as the دَلَّال with respect to houses: (O, L, K:) or
one who carries the articles of merchandise of the
tribe, and conveys those articles from place to
place for sale: (Ibn-'Abbád, Sgh, K:) it is said
in the A that بَاضِعُ الحَىِّ signifies the person who
carries the articles of merchandise of the tribe.
(TA.)
بَاضِعَةٌ A wound by which the head is broken,
(S, Mgh, Msb, K,) which cuts the skin, and
cleaves the flesh (S, K) in a slight degree, (K,)
and brings blood, but does not make it to flow:
(S, K:) or which wounds the skin, and cleaves
the flesh: (Mgh:) or which cleaves the flesh, but
does not reach to the bone, nor cause the blood to
flow: (Msb:) that from which the blood flows
is termed دَامِيَةٌ [app. a mistake for دَامِعَةٌ]. (S,
Msb.)
-A2-  A large flock (فِرْقٌ [in the CK, erroneously, فِرَق,]) of sheep or goats: (S, Sgh, K:)
or a portion separated from the rest of the sheep
or goats: (Lth, K:) pl. بَوَاضِعُ: you say, فِرَقٌ بَوَاضِعُ.
(Lth.)
أَبْضَعُ as a corroborative after أَجْمَعُ: see أَبْصَعُ,
with the unpointed ص. Az says that it is an
evident mistranscription. (TA.)
مِبْضَعٌ A lancet; an instrument with which a
vein is cut: (S, Mgh, * K, TA:) and [a currier's
knife] with which leather is cut: (S, TA:) [pl.
مَبَاضِعُ: accord. to the Mirkát el-Loghah, as cited
by Golius, it signifies a farrier's fleam; differing
from مِشْرَطٌ, which signifies a surgeon's lancet:
but this distinction is probably post-classical; for
accord. to the TA, these two words signify the
same.]
مَبْضُوعَةٌ [used as a subst.] A bow: a bow cut
from a branch. (TA.)
مُسْتَبْضِعٌ. It is said in a prov., كَمُسْتَبْضِعِ تَمْرٍ
إِلَى هَجَرٍ [Like the taker of dates as merchandise
to Hejer]; because Hejer is [famous as] the place
of production (مَعْدِن) of dates. (S.) مستبضع is
here made trans. by means of الى because it has
the meaning of حَامِل. (TA.)
