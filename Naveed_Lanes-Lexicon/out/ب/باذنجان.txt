باذنجانبَاذَنْجَانٌ, [or بَاذِنْجَانٌ, commonly pronounced
in the present day بَادنْجَان and بَيْدِنْجَان and
بِيدِنْجَان, from the Persian بَادِنْكَانْ,] a word of
well-known meaning, often mentioned by the
author of the K, [in explaining the words أَنَبٌ
and حَدَقٌ and مَغْدٌ and وَغْدٌ,] but not in its proper
place in the lexicon. (TA.) [It signifies The
solanum melongena, mad-apple, or egg-plant; both
the black, distinguished by the epithet أَسْوَدُ, and
the white, distinguished by the epithet أَبْيَضُ.
And the solanum lycopersicum, or solanum Aethiopicum; also called love-apple, and so by the
Arabs, تُفَّاحٌ الحُبٌِّ; and golden apple, تُفَّاحٌ ذَهَبِىٌّ;
and tomato; and distinguished from the former
species by the epithet أَحْمَرُ, and by the appellation
باذنجان قُوطَة.] ―
