piece of بَعْر; i. q. ↓ رَمَتْ بِالبَعْرَة; meaning she

could marry again. (A.) [It seems to have been
customary for the widow to collect a number of
pieces of بَعْر, as many as the days she had to wait
before she could marry again, and to throw away
one each day: so that the saying means She threw
the last piece of بعر.]

بَعْرٌ (S, A, K) and ↓ بَعَرٌ (Msb, K) [coll. gen. ns.
signifying Camels', and sheeps', and goats', and
similar, dung;] dung (Msb, K) of animals having
the kind of foot called خُفّ, (A, Mgh, Msb, K)
[i. e.,] of the camel, and also of the sheep and goat,
(S,) and of cloven-hoofed animals (A, Mgh, Msb,
K) of the wild kind of bull and cow, but not of

K:) and pl. أَبْعَارٌ. (S, Msb, K) One says, هُوَ
أَهْوَنُ عَلَىَّ مِنْ بَعْرَةٍ يُرْمَى بِهَا كَلْبٌ [He is a lighter
thing to me than a piece of بعر that is thrown at
a dog]. (A.) And it is said in a prov., أَنْتَ
كَصَاحِبِ البَعْرَةِ [Thou art like the owner of the
piece of بعر, or أَنْتَ فِى مِثْلِ صَاحِبِ البَعْرَةِ Thou
art in a condition like that of the owner of the
piece of بعر; (meaning the person for whom it
was intended;) applied to him who reveals a
thing relating to himself; (see Freytag's Arab.
Prov. i. 85;)] originating from the fact that a
man had a suspicion respecting some one among
his people; so he collected them to search out
from them the truth of the case, and took a piece
of بعر, and said, “I am about to throw this my
piece of بعر at the person whom I suspect;”
whereupon one of them withdrew himself quickly,
and said, “Throw it not at me;” and confessed.
(TA.) See also بَعَرَتْ, above.
بَعَرٌ: see بَعْرٌ.
بِعَارٌ, a subst., [or inf. n. of 3,] The befouling of
her milker with her dung, by a ewe or she-goat,
(K,) or a camel: (TA:) it is reckoned a fault,
because the animal that does so sometimes casts
her dung into the milking-vessel. (TA.)
بَعِيرٌ, (S, Msb, K, &c.,) sometimes pronounced
بَعِيرٌ, (K,) which latter is of the dial. of BenooTemeem, but the former is the more chaste,
(TA,) A camel, male or female; (S, Msb, K;)
as applied to a camel, like إِنْسَانٌ applied to a
human being; (S, Msb;) whereas جَمَلٌ is applied
only to a male camel, and نَاقَةٌ to a she-camel;
بَكْرٌ and بَكْرَةٌ are respectively terms like فَتنًى and
فَتَاةٌ; and قَلُوصٌ is like the term جَارِيَةٌ; so say,
among others, ISk and Az and IJ; and it is
added in the Mutahffidh, that the terms جمل
and ناقة are applied only when the animal has
entered the seventh year: (Msb:) but بعير is
more commonly applied to the male camel; (Msb,
K;) and only to one that has entered its fifth
year; (S, K;) or that has entered its ninth year:
(K:) the pl. is أَبْعِرَةٌ [a pl. of pauc.] and بُعْرَانٌ
(S, Msb, K) and بِعْرَانٌ (K) and بُعُرٌ (TA) and
(pl. of أَبْعِرَةٌ TA) أَبَاعِرُ (S, Msb, K) and أَبَاعِيرُ
(K.) If one say, أَعْطُونِى بَعِيرًا [Give ye to me a
بعير], the persons so addressed, accord. to EshSháfi'ee, are not to give a she-camel: (Msb:)
but the following phrases are transmitted from
the Arabs: صَرَعَتْنِى بَعِيرِى My she-camel threw
me down prostrate: (S, A:) and حَلَبْتُ بَعِيرِى I
milked my camel: (A, Msb:) and شَرِبْتُ مِنْ لَبَنِ
بَعِيرِى I drank of the milk of my camel: (S:)
and كِلَا هٰذِيْنِ البِعْرَيْنِ نَاقَةٌ Each of these two
camels is a she-camel. (A.) لَيْلَةُ البَعِيرِ [The night
of the camel], mentioned in a trad. of Jábir,
means the night in which the Prophet purchased
of him his camel. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Also An ass: (IKh,
K:) so in the Kur xii. 72; but this signification
is of rare occurrence: (IKh:) and anything that
carries: (IKh, K:) so in the Hebrew language
[165 (see Gen. xlv. 17)]. (TA.)
بَاعِرٌ A widow throwing the piece of بَعْر; meaning ending the number of days during which she
has had to wait after the death of her husband
previously to her being allowed to marry again.
(A.) [See 1.]
مَبْعَرٌ and ↓ مِبْعَرٌ [and ↓ مَبْعَرَةٌ (occurring in the
K in art. خور)] The place [or passage (as is
shown in the Lexicons in many places)] of the
بَعْر; [i. e. the rectum; the intestine, or gut, containing the بَعْر;] of any quadruped: (K:) pl.
مَبَاعِرُ. (TA.) It is said in a prov., إِنَّ هٰذَا الدَّاعِرَ
مَا زَالَ يَنْحَرُ الأَبَاعِرَ وَ يَنْثِلُ المَبَاعِرَ [Verily this bad
man has not ceased to slaughter camels and to
cleanse the intestines containing the dung]. (A,
TA.)
مِبْعَرٌ: see مَبْعَرٌ
مَبْعَرَةٌ: see مَبْعَرٌ
مِبْعَارٌ A ewe or she-goat, (K,) or a she-camel,
(TA,) that befouls with her dung (تُبَاعِرُ) her
milker. (K, TA.) [See بِعَارٌ.]
