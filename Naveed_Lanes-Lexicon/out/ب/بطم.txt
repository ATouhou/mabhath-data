بطمبُطْمٌ (S, K) and بُطُمٌ, (K,) the latter allowable accord. to IAar, (TA,) The حَبَّة خَضْرَآء [or
fruit of the terebinth-tree, to which this latter
appellation is given in the present day, i. e., of
the pistacia terebinthus of the botanists]; (S, K;)
so accord. to the people of El-'Áliyeh; and the like
is said on the authority of As: (TA:) or the
tree thereof; (K;) [which is called بُطْم in the
present day;] so accord. to AHn; and he says,
but no one has told me that it grows in the land
of the Arabs; but they assert that the ضِرْو [meaning the cancamum-tree, also called كَمْكَام, but
said by IAar to be the حبّة خضراء,] is nearly
like it: (TA:) its fruit is heating, diuretic,
strengthening to the venereal faculty, good for
the cough, and for the [disease of the face called]
لَقْوَة, and for the kidney; and the overspreading
of the hair with its dry and sifted leaves causes
it to grow, and beautifies it. (K.)
