بأزبَأْزٌ i. q. بَازٍ [which see in art. بزو; and بَازٌ]: pl.
[of pauc.] أَبْؤُزٌ, and [of mult.] بُؤُوزٌ and بِئْزَانٌ.
(K.) IJ holds that the أ is substituted for ا, and
that it remains in ابؤز and بئزان like as is the
case in أَعْيَادٌ [in which the ى is substituted for و
and remains in the pl. because it is substituted for
و in the sing. عِيدٌ]. (TA.)
