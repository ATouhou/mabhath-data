بوح1
بَاحَ, (A, Msb, K,) aor. يَبُوحُ, (Msb,) inf. n.
بَوْحٌ, (A, Msb,) It (a secret, A, or a thing, Msb)
became apparent, or manifest. (A, Msb, K.) You
say, بَاحَ مَا كَتَبْتُ [What I concealed became
apparent]. (A.) And أَعُوذُ بِاللّٰهِ مشنْ بَوْحِ السِّرِّ
وَكَشْفِ السِّتْرِ [I seek protection by God from the
appearing of the secret, and the removing of the
veil, or covering]. (A.)
-A2-  بَاحَ بِهِ, (S, A, Msb,
K,) [aor. as above,] inf. n. بَوْحٌ and بُؤُوحٌ and
بُؤُوحَةٌ, (K, TA,) He revealed, or disclosed, it;
(S, A, Msb, K;) namely, a secret, (S, A, K,) or
a thing; (Msb;) as also ↓ اباحهُ. (A, Msb, K.)
It (the former) is said to be from ↓ الإِبَاحَهُ [the
inf. n. of the latter] signifying The showing a
thing to the beholder in order that he who will
may take it. (TA.) You say, سِرًّا فَبَاحَ بِهِ ↓ أَبَاحَهُ
He revealed to him a secret, and he (the latter)
[revealed it, i. e.,] did not conceal it. (TA.)
And بُحْ بِاسْمِكَ وَ لَا تَكْنِ عَنْهُ [Reveal thou thy
name, and make not a mere allusion to it]. (A.)

اباح, inf. n. إِبَاحَةٌ: see 1, in three places. ―
-b2-
إِبَاحَةٌ and ↓ اِسْتِبَاحَةٌ are used as syn.: but it is
said that the former signifies The making a thing
allowable, or free, to him who desires it, or seeks
it: and the latter, the taking a thing as allowed,
allowable, free, or lawful. (MF.) You say, اباح
الشَّىْءَ He made the thing allowable, or free. (L.)
And اباح مَالَهُ He gave permission either to take
or let alone his property; made it allowable, or
free, either way one might choose to take. (Msb.)
And أَبَحْتُكَ الشَّىْءَ I made, or have made, the
thing allowable, free, or lawful, to thee, (S, L, K,
TA,) to take it, [or let it alone,] or do it, [or
make use of it,] or possess it; but not by the law
of the religion, for to do this belongs to God and
his apostle; except in the language of this law.
(MF, TA.) [Hence it is said that] إِبَاحَةٌ bears a
signification similar to that of نُهْبَى [i. e. Spoliation; a taking of spoil; or the taking a thing
as spoil; a signification more properly belonging
to the inf. n. of 10, q. v.]. (L.)
10

assigned to it in explanations of the saying, اِبْنُكَ
ابْنُ بُوحِكَ يَشْرَبُ مِنْ صَبُوحِكَ: (S, TA:) The
penis: (S, K, Har p. 336:) the فَرْج [or pudendum, app. meaning, of a woman]: (K, Har
p. 328 on the authority of AO:) the نَفْس [meaning one's self]: (IAar, T, S, Meyd, L:) coitus;
syn. وَطْءٌ (S) or جِمَاعٌ: (K:) and accord. to the last
but one of these renderings, [and virtually accord.
to the others also,] the saying means Thy son is
the son of thyself, [who drinks of thy morningdraught]; (T, TA;) he whom thou hast begotten,
not he whom thou hast adopted: (IAar, and Mtr
in Har p. 328:) or بوح, here, is pl. of بَاحَةٌ; (A,
TA, Har p. 336;) and the meaning is, he who
has been born within the courts of thy house;
(A;) or, in the court of thy house, (TA, Har,)
not in the house of another: (TA:) or بوح is
here a subst. from بَاحَ الشَّىْءِ; and the meaning
is, thy son is he whom thou hast openly acknowledged (بُحْتَ بِهِ), and whom his mother hath
also, agreeably with thee: (Har p. 328:) [accord.
to some,] it signifies also i. q. أَصْلٌ [i. e. origin;
or race, or stock, which it may mean in the saying
above: or original, or primary, state, or condition];
(K, Har p. 328;) [for] one says, رَجَعَ إِلَى بُوحِهِ
[He returned, or reverted, to his original, or
primary, state, or condition]. (Har p. 328.)

A, K,) and عَرْصَةٌ; (A, TA;) of a house or dwelling: (S, TA:) pl. بُوحٌ [q. v.]. (A, TA.) Hence

art. بح]. (TA.) One says also, نَحْنُ فِى بَاحَةِ الدَّارِ,
meaning We are in the middle, or midst, or best
part, of the abode, or district, or country; i. e.
أَوْسَطِهَا. (TA.) And hence, accord. to Fr, تَبَحْبَحَ

a trad., لَيْسَ لِلنِّسَآءِ مِنْ بَاحَةِ الطَّرِيقِ شَىْءْ, meaning
