بَلَاهُ, (T, S, Mgh, Msb,) aor.
بَلُوَ, (T, Msb,)
inf. n. بَلَآءٌ, (S,) or this is a simple subst., and the
inf. n. is بَلْوٌ, (T, Msb,) He (God) tried, proved,
or tested, him, (T, S, Msb,) بِخَيْرٍ [by, or with,
good], or بِشَّرٍ [by, or with, evil]; (Msb;) for
God tries his servant (يَبْلُوهُ) by, or with, a
benefit, to test his thankfulness; and by, or with,
a calamity, to test his patience; (T;) [wherefore
it often means He afflicted him;] as also ↓ ابلاهُ,
(T, S, Msb,) inf. n. إِبْلَآءٌ; (T, S; [in both restrieted
to good; but in the Msb it seems to be common
to good and evil;]) and ↓ ابتلاه: (T, S, M, Msb:)
and بَلَوْتُهُ, inf. n. بَلْوٌ (S, M, K) and بَلَآءٌ, (M, K,)
[but from what has been said above, it seems that
the latter is used only when the agent is God,
and that it is properly a simple subst.,] I tried,
proved, or tested, him; (S, M, Mgh, * K;) as also
↓ اِبْتَلَيْتُهُ: (M, K:) each of these verbs implying
two things; one of which is the learning the
state, or condition, of the object, and becoming
acquainted with what was unknown of the case
thereof; and the other, the manifesting of the
goodness or badness thereof; both of these things
being sometimes meant, and sometimes only one
of them, as when God is the agent, in which case
only the latter is meant: (Er-Rághib, TA:) and
↓ التَّبَالِى, also, signifies the act of trying, proving,
or testing. (S.) It is said in the Kur [xxi. 36],
وَنَبْلُوكُمْ بِالشَّرِ وَالخَيْرِ فِتْنَةً [And we try you by,
or with, evil and good, by way of probation].
(TA.) And in the same [ii. 118], ↓ وَإِذَ ابْتَلَى
إِبْرَاهِيمَ رَبُّهُ بِكَلَمَاتٍ [And when his Lord tried
Abraham by certain words, meaning commands
and prohibitions]. (TA.) And you say, ↓ لَا تُبْلِنَا
إِلَّا بِالَّتِى هِىَ أَحْسَنُ [Try Thou not us save by
those things that are best]; (T;) from a trad.
(TA.) [See also 4 and 8 below.] ―
-b2-  [Hence,]
بَلَوْتُهُ also signifies (tropical:)  I smelt it. (T in art. بول,
and A and TA.) ―
-b3-  [And بَلَاهُ He knew it, or became acquainted with it. (See بَالٍ.)] ―
-b4-  See also
4, in the latter half of the paragraph.
-A2-  بَلِى,
aor.
بَلَوَ, inf. n. بِلًا, or بِلًى, [in the CK, erroneously,
بَلًى,] and بَلَآءٌ, [in the CK, erroneously, بِلاء,] (T,
S, M, Msb, K,) the former with kesr and the
latter with fet-h, (T, S, Msb,) said of a garment,
(T, S, M, &c.,) It was, or became, old, and worn
out: (Msb:) belonging to the present art. and to
art. بلى. (M.) [The inf. n., used as a subst.,
signifies Wear; attrition; wear and tear: see
an ex. in a hemistich cited near the end of the
first paragraph of art. الا, where a dwelling is
likened to a garment.] ―
-b2-  Also said of a plant [as
meaning It became old and withered, or wasted].
(K in art. عنث, &c.) ―
-b3-  And of a corpse, meaning
It became consumed by the earth. (Msb.) ―
-b4-  And
of a bone, meaning It became old, and decayed;
syn. رَمَّ. (S and K &c. in art. رم.) ―
-b5-  And of a
man's reputation, meaning (assumed tropical:)  It became worn out
of regard or notice. (TA in art. دثر.) ―
-b6-  And
[hence,] بَلِيَتْ, (M,) or بُلِيَتْ, (K,) She (a camel,
M, K, or a mare, or beast of the equine kind, M)
was, or became, a بَلَيِّة; i. e., was tied at her dead
master's grave (M, K) without food or water (M)
until she died (M, K) and wasted away. (M in
art. بلى.)

بَلَّوَ see 4, in six places, in the latter half of the
paragraph.

لَا أَبَالِيهِ is from البلآء, [inf. n. of بَلَاهُ,] so that
it signifies [properly] I shall not, or I do not,
care for him, mind him, heed him, or regard him,
so as to share with him my trial and his trial:
(Ham p. 94:) [and hence,] one says thus, (S,
Mgh, Msb,) or مَا أَبَالِيهِ, (M, K,) and لَا أَبَالِىبِهِ,
(Mgh, Msb,) or مَا أُبَالِى بِهِ, (MF, TA,) but the
verb is more chastely made trans. without the
preposition بِ, (A, TA,) inf. n. مُبَالَاةٌ (M, Mgh,
Msb, K) and بِلَآءٌ (M, K, TA [in the CK, erroneously, بَلاء]) and بَالَةٌ (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,)
said by some to be a quasi-inf. n. and by others
to be an inf. n., (MF, TA,) [in the T it is said to
be a subst., from المُبَالَاةُ,] originally بَالِيَةٌ, like عَافِيَةٌ
from عَافَاهُ, (T, S, Mgh, Msb,) and بَالٌ, [which is
more strange,] (M, K,) meaning [merely] I shall
not, or I do not, care for, mind, heed, or regard,
him, or it; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;) I shall not be,
or I am not, disquieted by him, or it: (Mgh,
Msb:) or, as some say, لَا أُبَالِيهِ is formed by
transposition from لَا أُبَاوِلُهُ, from البَالُ, i. e. I will
not, or I do not, cause him, or it, to move, or
occur to, my mind; nor give, or pay, any attention to him, or it: (Z, TA: [and the like is said
in the T:]) or the proper [or literal] meaning is,
I will not, or I do not, contend with him for
superiority in goodness, or excellence, by reason
of my little care, or regard, for him: (Mgh:)
or it was employed to denote the contending with
another for superiority in glory, or excellence, as
will be shown by the citation of a verse in the
latter portion of this paragraph; and then, in
consequence of frequency of usage, came to denote
contempt, or mean estimation: (Ham p. 31:) or
its original meaning is, I will not, or I do not,
strive with him to be first; neglecting him, or
leaving him to himself; from تَبَالَى القَوْمُ as explained below; see 6. (Msb.) It is said in a
trad., لَا يُبَالِيهِمُ اللّٰهُ بَالَةً, or, accord. to one reading,
لَا يُبَالِى بِهِمْ بَالَةً, meaning God will not hold them
to be of any value or weight. (TA.) And in
another, هٰؤُلآءِ فِى الجَنَّةِ وَلَا أُبَالِى وَهٰؤُلَآءِ فِى النَّارِ
وَلَا أُبَالِى, said to mean [These will be in Paradise,
and] I shall not disapprove; [and these will be
in the fire of Hell,] and I shall not disapprove.
(Az, TA.) And one says, لَا أُبَالِى مَا صَنَعْتَ [I
shall not, or I do not, care for what thou didst,
or hast done]. (IDrd, TA.) And مَا أُبَالِى أَقُمْتَ
أَمْ قَعَدْتَ [I care not whether thou stand or sit]:
and مَا أُبَالِى بِقِيَامِكَ وَعَدَمِهِ [I care not for thy
standing and thy not doing so]. (Mughnee in
art. ا.) And مَا بَالَيْتُ بِهِ (AZ, Msb, TA) I did
not care for, mind, or regard, him, or it. (TA.)
And بَالَى بِالشَّىْءِ [He cared for the thing; or] he
was disquieted by the thing. (T.) The verb is
sometimes thus used, in an affirmative manner;
(Ham p. 94; [and the like is said in the TA;])
though some say that it is not; (Msb;) but it is
not unless it occurs with a negative in the former
part of the sentence or in the latter part thereof;
as when one says, مَا بَالَى بِكَ صَدِيقُكَ وَلٰكِنْ بَالَى
عَبْدُكَ [Thy friend cared not for thee, but thy
slave cared]; and as in the saying of Zuheyr,
لَقَدْ بَالَيْتُ مَظْعَنَ أُمِّ أَوْفَى
وَلٰكِنْ أُمُّ أَوْفَى لَا تُبَالِى
[Verily I cared for the departure of Umm-Owfà,
but Umm-Owfà cares not]. (Ham p. 94.) One
says also, لَمْ أُبَالِ and لَمْ أُبَلْ [I did not care,
&c.]: (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K: [but in the CK
the latter of these is omitted:]) in the latter the ا
[of prolongation] is suppressed for the purpose of
alleviating the utterance, like as ى is suppressed
in the inf. n. [or quasi-inf. n.] بَالَةٌ, (S, Mgh,
Msb,) originally بَالِيَةٌ, (S, Msb,) and in لَا أَدْرِ:
(S:) or the ا is suppressed in this case to avoid
the concurrence of two quiescent letters; (Kh,
Sb, M, IB;) not for the purpose of alleviating
the utterance; (IB, TA;) for this is done because
the ل is made quiescent. (Kh, Sb, M.) And,
accord. to Kh, (Sb, M,) some of the Arabs say,
لَمْ أُبَلِهِ [I did not care for him, or it], (Sb, M,)
or لَمْ أُبَلِ, [in the CK, erroneously, لم اَبْلِ,] with
kesr to the ل; (K, TA;) [for لم أُبَالِهِ, or لم أُبَالِ;]
only suppressing the ا, as they do in عُلَبِطٌ [for
عُلَابِطٌ]. (Sb, S, M.) ―
-b2-  IAar says that بَالَى,
inf. n. مُبَالَاةٌ, is like ↓ أَبْلَى meaning He exerted
himself in a description of a war, or battle, or of
generous conduct; as when one says, أَبْلَى ذٰلِكَ
اليَوْمَ بَلَآءً حَسَنًا [He exerted himself well, that
day, in a description of war, &c.]: and he cites
the following verse [to which reference has been
made above]:
وَأَنْتَ قَدْمَتَّ مِنَ الهُزَالِ
[What hath happened to me that I see thee standing exerting thyself in a description of generous
qualities, when thou hast become like one dead by
reason of leanness?]: he says that he [the poet]
heard him [whom he thus addresses] saying, “We
have eaten and we have drunk [with guests], and
we have done [such and such things]; ” enumerating, or recounting, generous qualities or actions,
and lying in doing so: (T, TA:) in another place
he says that تُبَالِى means looking to see which of
them [or of thee and others] is best in بال [i. e.
state, or condition], while thou art dying: (TA:)
he says, also, that بَالَاهُ, inf. n. مُبَالَاةٌ, signifies he
contended with him for superiority in glory, or
excellence; (T, TA; *) and [it is said that] تبالى
in the verse here cited means thus contending;
syn. تُفَاخِرُ: (Ham p. 31:) and accord. to IAar,
بَالَاهُ also signifies he contended with him in contradiction. (T, TA.)
4
ابلاهُ, inf. n. إِبْلَآءٌ: see 1, in two places. ―
-b2-
[Hence,] ابلاهُ اللّٰهُ إِبْلَآءً حَسَنًا, (T,) or بَلَآءَ حَسَنًا,
(S,) God did to him a good deed. (T.) [And
hence,] it is said in the Kur [viii. 17], وَلِيُبْلِىَ
المُؤْمِنِينَ مِنْهُ بَلَآءً حَسَنُا (TA) And that He might
confer upon the believers a great benefit, or favour,
or blessing: (Bd:) or a good gift; meaning spoil.
(Jel.) And أَبْلَيْتُهُ مَعْرُوفًا [I conferred upon him
a favour, or benefit]. (S.) Zuheyr says,
جَزَى اللّٰهُ بِا لإِحْسَانِ مَا فَعَلَا بِكُمْ
وَأَبْلَاهُمَا خَيْرَ البَلَآءِ الَّذِى يَبْلُو
(T, * S,) meaning, الذى يَبْلُو بِهِ عِبَادَهُ, (T,) or
الذى يَخْتَبِرُ بِهِ عِبَادَ, (S,) i. e. [May God recompense with beneficence what they two have done to
you,] and do to them two the best of the deeds
wherewith He tries [the thankfulness of] his
servants. (T.) ―
-b3-  ابلاهُ also signifies He made
him to swear; [as though he tried his veracity by
so doing;] (M, K;) or so ابلاهُ يَمِينًا. (TA.)
[See also 8.] ―
-b4-  And He swore to him: (M, K:)
or this, (TA,) or ابلاهُ يَمِينًا, [as above,] (T, S,)
he swore [or swore an oath] to him, and thereby
soothed, or placated, his mind. (T, S, * TA.) ―
-b5-
And hence, (TA,) He informed him, acquainted
him, or told him. (IAar, M, K, TA.) ―
-b6-  [And
hence, He manifested it; revealed it; made it
manifest, apparent, evident, clear, or plain;
whence a phrase in a verse cited voce مُضْمَرٌ;
and the phrase] مَا لَمْ يُبْلِ العُذْرَ, i. e. As long as
he does not manifest, show, or make apparent, the
excuse: but the verb [in this sense] is originally
doubly trans.: one says, أَبْلَيْتُ فُلَانًا عُذْرًا, meaning
I manifested to such a one an excuse so that I
was not to be blamed after it; properly signifying
I made such a one to be acquainted with my
excuse, and to know the manner thereof; (Mgh;)
and thus it is explained in the A: (TA: [in like
manner, also, it is explained in the T:]) [or]
ابلاهُ عُذْرًا signifies He gave him an excuse which
he accepted: (M, K:) and in like manner, ابلاهُ
جُهْدَهُ [He gave him his endeavour, or energy, in
an acceptable manner]; and نَائِلَهُ [his gift]. (M.)
Hence, ابلى عُذْرَهُ signifies also He strove, laboured,
or exerted himself, [and thus manifested his excuse,]
in work. (Mgh.) And hence, ابلى فِى الحَرْبِ
He manifested, or showed, his might, valour, or
prowess, in war, or fight, [and he strove, laboured,
or exerted himself, therein, (عُذْرَهُ being understood,)] so that men proved him and knew him.
(Mgh.) See also 3, where another explanation of
ابلى is given, in the latter portion of the paragraph.
-A2-  ابلى الثَّوْبَ [He wore out the garment;]
trans. of بَلِىَ; (T, S, M, K;) as also ↓ بَلَّاهُ; (M,
K;) belonging to the present art. and to art. بلى.
(M.) One says to the مُجِدّ [i. e. him who makes,
or puts on, a new garment], أَبْلِ وَ يُخْلِفُ اللّٰهُ
[Wear out thy garment, and God will replace it
with another; or, may God replace &c.]. (S.)
And أَبْلِ وَ أَجِدَّ وَاحْمِدَ الكَاسِى Wear out, and
make new, [or put on new,] and praise the
Clother [meaning God]. (S in art. جد.) ―
-b2-
[Hence,] السَّفَرُ ↓ بَلَّاهُ [Journeying, or travel, wore
him, or wasted him]; namely, a man; (M, K;
but in the copies of the latter, ↓ بَلَاهُ [which I think
an evident mistranscription];) as also عَلَيْهِ ↓ بلّى;
and ابلاهُ: (M:) and so الهَمُّ [anxiety], (M, K,)
and the like, (M,) and التَّجَارِبُ [tryings, or trying
events]: (K:) and ابلاها السَّفَرُ (T, S) or ↓ بلّاها
(thus in a copy of the S) [journeying, or travel,
wore her, or wasted her]; namely, a she-camel.
(T, S.) El-'Ajjáj says,
وَالمَرْءُ يُبْلِيهِ بَلَآءَ السِّرْبَالْ
كَرُّاللَّيالِى وَاخْتِلَافُ الأَحْوَالُ
[And man, the returning of the nights time after
time, and the alternation of states of being, wear
him out as the wearing out of the shirt]: (S, M: *)
he means, إِبْلَآءَ السِرْبَال, or فَبَلِىَ بَلَآءَ السِّرْبَال. (M.)
And Ibn-Ahmar says,
لَبِسْتُ أَبِى حَتَّى تَمَلَّيْتُ عُمْرَهُ
وَبَلَّيْتُ أَعْمَامِى وَ بَلَّيْتُ خَالِيَا
he means I lived the period that my father lived
[so that I had long enjoyment of his life, and I
outwore my paternal uncles, and I outwore my
maternal uncle]: or, as some say, I lived with my
father for the length of his life &c. (M, TA. *
[In the latter, ↓ تَبَلَّيْتُ is put in the place of تَمَلَّيْتُ;
and hence it is there said that تَبَلَّاهُ is like بَلَّاهُ:
but I think that تبلّيت is a mistranscription.]) ―
-b3-
أَبْلَيْتُ and ↓ بَلَّيْتُ also signify I bound the foreshank of a she-camel to her arm at the grave of
her [dead] master, and left her without food or
water until she died; or I dug for her a pit, and
left her in it until she died. (S, TA. [See بَلِيَّةٌ,
and مُبَلًّى.])
5
تَبَلَّوَ see 4, near the end of the paragraph.
6
التَّبَالِى [inf. n. of تَبَالَى]: see 1.
-A2-  تبالى القَوْمُ
The people, or company of men, vied, or strove,
one with another, in hastening to a little water,
and drew from it. (Msb.)
8
ابتلاهُ: see 1, in three places. [Hence, اُبْتِلِىَ
بِكَذَا (vulg. اِبْتَلَى) He was tried, proved, or tested,
by, or with, such a thing; generally meaning he
was afflicted thereby, or therewith; as, for instance,
by, or with, a disease.] ―
-b2-  Also He asked, or
sought, or desired, of him information, or news,
or tidings. (M, K.) And ابتلى signifies also He
conjured, or adjured, and asked if any had knowledge; syn. اِسْتَحْلَفَ and اِسْتَعْرَفَ [explained by
what here follows]. (M, K, TA. [In the CK,
both the verb and the explanation are here
wrong: the former is written اُبْلِىَ; and the latter,
اسْتُحْلِفَ و اسْتُعْرِفَ.]) A poet says,
تَبَغَّى أَبَاهَا فِى الرِّفَاقِ وَ تَبْتَلِى
وَ أَوْدَي بِهِ فِى لُجَّةِ البَحْرِ تَمْسَحُ
[She seeks for her father among the travellingcompanions, and conjures, or adjures, and asks.
if any have knowledge, when a crocodile has
destroyed him in the depth of the great river:
تَبَغَّى is for تَتَبَغَّى]: he means that she says to
them, “I conjure you, or adjure you, by God,
(نَاشَدْتُكُمْ اللّٰهَ,) [tell me,] do ye know any tidings
of my father? ” (M, TA.) But Aboo-Sa'eed says
that تتبلى here means tries, proves, or tests; and
that الاِبْتِلَآءُ signifies the trying, proving, or testing,
whether by an oath or otherwise. (TA.) ―
-b3-  [Also
He desired it; he sought it.] It is said in a trad.,
النَّذْرُ مَا ابْتُلِىَ بِهِ وَجْهُ اللّٰهُ, i. e. [The vow that a
man makes to be binding, or obligatory, on himself
is that whereby the recompense of God] is desired,
or sought. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And He chose him, made
choice of him, or elected him. (Sh and T, from a
trad.)
12
اِبْلَوْلَى It (herbage) became tall, so that the
camels were able to avail themselves of it. (K.)
بِلْوُ سَفَرٍ, (T, S, M, A,) with kesr to the ب, (S,)
and بِلْىُ سَفَرٍ, (S, A,) Worn, or wasted, by journeying, or travel; applied to a she-camel, (T, S,
M, A,) and in like manner to a man, and to a
he-camel: (M:) and بِلْىُ أَسْفَارٍ (M, K) and بِلْوُ
أَسْفَارٍ, (K, TA,) with kesr to the ب in both, (TA,
[in the CK written with fet-h,]) a man worn, or
wasted, by journeyings, or travels, and anxiety,
(M, K, *) and the like, (M,) and tryings, or trying events: (K:) pl. أَبْلَآءٌ. (S, M.) And بِلْوٌ شَرٍّ
and بِلْىُ شَرٍّ [both written in the CK with fet-h
to the ب] A man having strength, or power, to
endure evil; tried, proved, or tested, thereby:
(M, K:) and in like manner, بِلْوُ خَيْرٍ and بِلْىُ خَيْرٍ
[tried, &c., by good, or prosperity]. (TA.) And
إِنَّهُ لِبَلْوٌ مِنْ أَبْلَآءِ المَالِ and بِلْىٌ [both written in
the CK with fet-h to the ب as before] Verily he
is one of those who manage, or tend, camels, or
the like, well. (M, * K, * TA.) The ى in بِلْى, in
all these instances, is originally و, changed into
ى because of the kesreh, and the weakness of the
intervening letter, ل; as is the case in عِلَْيَةٌ: so
says IJ. (M.)
بَلَى: see art. بلى.
بِلْوَةٌ: see what next follows.
بِلْيَةٌ: see what next follows.
بَلْوَي: see what next follows.
بَلَآءٌ (T, S, Msb) and ↓ بَلْوَى (T, S, M, Msb,
K) and ↓ بَلِيَّةٌ (S, M, Msb, K) and ↓ بِلْوَةٌ, (S, M,
K,) with kesr, (S, K,) and ↓ بِلْيَةٌ, (so in a copy
of the S, beside the third,) thus in the handwriting
of Aboo-Zekereeyà, in the place of the third,
(TA,) substs. (T, M, Msb, K) from بَلَاهُ اللّٰهُ, (T,
Msb,) or from اِبْتَلَاهُ اللّٰهُ, [which is the same in
meaning,] (M,) or from بَلَوْتُهُ, (K,) are one [in
their signification; which is A trial, as meaning
a probation, or a test; and as meaning particularly
a trouble or an affliction of any kind by which
one's patience or any other grace or virtue is
tried, proved, or tested]; (S;) and the pl. (S,
TA) of ↓ بَلِيَّةٌ (TA) is بَلَايَا, of the measure فَعَائِلُ
changed to فَعَالَى: (S, TA:) [or] بَلَآءٌ is [properly, or originally,] an inf. n., (S, M, K,) and
signifies the act of trying, proving, or testing, by,
or with, good, and by, or with, evil: (S, M:) it
is evil and good: (T, M: *) a trial, or an affliction, (T, K,) which is its original meaning; (T;)
and a [probationary] benefit, favour, or blessing,
(T,) or a [probationary] gift; (K;) the former
of these requiring patience, and the latter being
the greater of the two [as being commonly the
more dangerous to the soul]; (TA;) [but the
latter meaning is generally indicated only by the
addition of an epithet: thus] بَلَآءٌ حَسَنٌ means a
great benefit, or favour, or blessing, of God; (Bd
in viii. 17;) or a good gift of God: (Jel ibid.:)
بَلَآءٌ also means grief; as though it tried the
body: (Er-Rághib, K:) and the imposition of a
difficult, or troublesome, thing; a requirement;
an exaction; because it is difficult, or distressing,
to the body; or because it is trying. (K.) بَلَآءِ
(like قَطَامِ, S, K) is syn. with البَلَآءُ: (S, M, K:)
occurring in the saying, نَزَلَتْ بَلَآءِ عَلَى الكُفَّارِ
[Trial, or affliction, befell the unbelievers]: (S,
M, * K: *) mentioned by El-Ahmar, as heard by
him from the Arabs. (S.)
بِلَآءٌ, like كِتَابٌ in form, [is an inf. n. of 3,
q. v.:
-A2-  and also signifies] Anxiety respecting
which one talks to himself, or soliloquizes. (Msb.
[Compare a meaning of بَلَآءٌ, above.])
بَلِىٌّ: see the paragraph next following; last
sentence.
بَلِيَّةٌ: see بَلَآءٌ, in two places.
-A2-  Also A she-camel that has her fore shank bound to her arm
at the grave of her master, and is left without
food until she dies: (T:) or a she-camel, (M in
arts. بلو and بلى, and K,) or a mare, or beast of
the equine kind, (M in art. بلو,) that is bound at
the grave of her master, (M, K,) he being dead,
and is left without food or water (M) until she
dies (M, K) and wastes away; for they used to
say that her master would be raised from the
dead upon her: (M:) or a she-camel which, in
the Time of Ignorance, had her fore shank bound
to her arm at the grave of her master, and was
left without food or water until she died: or for
which was dug a pit, wherein she was left until
she died: for they used to assert that men would
be raised from the dead riding upon the بَلَايَا,
[pl. of بَلِيَّةٌ in the sense above explained, (T,
TA,)] or walking if their beasts whereon they
rode were not bound, with the head turned backwards, at their graves: (S:) or a cow, or she-camel, or sheep, or goat, which, in the Time of
Ignorance, they used to hamstring, or slaughter,
at the grave: so in a trad. (TA.) Suh says that
this custom proves that, in the Time of Ignorance,
