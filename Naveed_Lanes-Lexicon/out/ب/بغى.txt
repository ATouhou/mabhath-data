بغى1
بَغَى, (S, K, &c.,) aor.
بَغِىَ, (Msb, K,) inf. n.
بُغَآءٌ, (S, Mgh, K, &c.,) or this is a simple subst.,
and the inf. n. is بَغْىٌ, (Msb,) [but, if this be
correct, the former is generally used for the latter,]
and بُغًى, (Lh, K,) but the first is better known,
and is the chaste form, and some say, بِغًى, (TA,)
and بُغْيَةٌ and بِغْيَةٌ, (K,) accord. to Th, but others
hold these two to be simple substs., and some
mention also بَغْيَةٌ, with fet-h, (TA,) and بُغَايَةٌ,
(As, S, TA,) He sought; sought for, or after;
sought, desired, or endeavoured, to find, and take,
or get; (S, Mgh, Msb, K, &c.;) a stray-beast,
(As, S, TA,) or any other thing, (S, Mgh, * Msb, *
K, * TA,) good or evil; (Lh, TA;) as also ↓ ابتغى
and ↓ تبغّى (S, Msb, K) and ↓ استبغى: (K:) or
↓ ابتغى signifies he sought, &c., diligently, studiously, sedulously, or earnestly: (Er-Rághib, TA:)
and بَغَى signifies also he loved, or affected, a
thing: (MF, TA:) or, accord. to Er-Rághib, the
inf. n. signifies the seeking to exceed the just
bounds in respect of that which one aims at, or
endeavours after, whether one actually exceed or
do not; and sometimes it is considered in relation
to quantity; and sometimes, in relation to quality.
(TA.) You say, بَغَاهُ بِشَرٍّ [He sought him with
an evil purpose; or sought to do him evil]. (S
and K in art. عقب.) ―
-b2-  And بَغَاهُ He sought, &c.,
a thing for him; like بَغَى لَهُ. (Lh, Mgh, * K. *)
You say, بَغَاهُ الشَّىْءَ He sought, &c., the thing for
him; (S, K;) as also الشَّىْءَ ↓ ابغاهُ: (K:) thus
you say, اِبْغِنِى كَذَا or كذا ↓ أَبْغِنِى and اِبْغَ لِى
كذا Seek thou for me such a thing; (TA;) and
ضَالَّتِى ↓ أَبْغِنِى Seek thou for me my stray-beast:
(Mgh:) or الشَّىءَ ↓ ابغاهُ signifies He aided, or
assisted, him to seek the thing: (Ks, K:) or
كَذَا ↓ أَبْغِنِى signifies Seek thou for me such a
thing; and also Aid thou me to seek such a thing.
(JK.) It is said in the Kur [ix. 47], يَبْغُونَكُمُ
الفِتْنَةَ They seek, or desire, for you discord, or
dissension; or they seeking, &c.: and in the same
[iii. 94], تَبْغُونَهَا عِوَجًا Ye seek, or desire, for it,
namely, the way [of God], crookedness; or ye
seeking, &c.: the first objective complement of
the verb being in the accus. case because of the
suppression of the preposition ل. (TA.) ―
-b3-
[Hence, app.,] بَغَانِى دَآءً It procured to me
disease; it caused disease to befall me. (Ham
p. 794.) And إِنَّهُ لَذُو بُغَايَةٍ Verily he is one who
makes much gain: (JK, K:) but in the M, ذُو
بُغَايَةٍ لِلْكَسْبِ, meaning a seeker of gain. (TA.)
And مَابُغِىَ لَهُ Good was not appointed to betide
him. (TA.) ―
-b4-  بَغَى عَلَى أَخِيهِ, inf. n. بَغْىٌ, He
envied his brother; he wished that a blessing, or
cause of happiness, or an excellence, might become
transferred from his brother to himself: so says
Lh, who holds this to be the primary signification
of the verb. (TA.) It is said in a prov., البَغْىُ
عِقَالُ النَّصْرِ [Envy is the shackle of aid from God
against an enemy or a wrongdoer]. (TA.) ―
-b5-
Hence, (Lh, TA,) بَغْىٌ signifies The acting wrongfully, injuriously, or tyrannically; (Lh, S, TA;)
because the envier so acts towards the envied; his
endeavour being to cause, by guile, the blessing
of God upon him to depart from him: (Lh, TA:)
or the seeking, or endeavouring, to act corruptly,
wrongly, or unjustly: (Az, TA:) or the exceeding
the due bounds, or just limits, in any way: (S:)
accord. to Er-Rághib, it is of two kinds: one of
these is approved, and this is the passing beyond
the bounds of equity to exercise beneficence, and
beyond the bounds of obligatory duties to do what
is not obligatory: the other is disapproved, and
this is the passing beyond the bounds of that which
is true, or right, to do that which is false, or
wrong, or to do acts of a doubtful nature: but in
most instances it is that which is disapprove.
(TA.) You say, بَغَى عَلَيْهِ, (S, K,) and بغى عَلَى
النَّاسِ, (Az, Msb,) aor.
بَغِىَ, (K,) inf. n. بَغْىٌ, (Msb,
K,) He exalted himself against him, or above
him; overpowered, or oppressed, him; (Fr, S,
K;) acted wrongfully, injuriously, or tyrannically, towards him; and deviated from the right
way: (K:) and he acted wrongfully, injuriously,
or tyrannically, towards men, or the people, (Az,
Msb,) and sought to annoy them, or hurt them.
(Az, TA.) Lh mentions, on the authority of Ks,
the saying, مَا لِى وَلِلْبَغِ بَعْضِكُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ [What
have I to do with wrongful conduct, the wrongful
conduct of one of you towards another?], for
وَلِلْبَغْىِ; ISd thinks, because of the difficulty
found in pronouncing the kesreh after the ى.
(TA.) بَغَى also signifies He occupied himself
with corrupt, wrong, or unjust, conduct: [accord.
to Fei,] from the same verb [in a sense to be
mentioned below,] said of a wound. (Msb.) Also,
aor.
بَغِىَ, (TA,) inf. n. بَغْىٌ, (Az, TA,) He magnified himself; or behaved proudly, haughtily, or
insolently: (Az, TA:) because he who does so
passes beyond the bounds of his proper station to
a station that does not belong to him. (TA.) ―
-b6-
And [hence,] بَغَى فِى مِشيَتِهِ, (K,) inf. n. بَغْىٌ,
(TA,) He [app. a horse, and perhaps a man also,]
was proud, or self-conceited, and quick, in his
gait: (K:) or بَغْىٌ in a horse, (S, TA,) or in the
running of a horse, (JK, TA,) is the being proud,
or self-conceited, with exceeding briskness or liveliness or sprightliness. (JK, S, TA.) ―

السَّمَآءُ, (S, K,) inf. n. بَغْىٌ, (TA,) The sky rained
vehemently: (A'Obeyd, S, K:) or exceeded, in
rain, the limit of what was wanted. (Er-Rághib,
TA.) And بَغَى الوَادِى The valley flowed with
water reaching to a place to which it had not
reached before. (S, TA.) ―
-b8-  بَغَتْ, (S, Mgh, Msb,
K,) said of a woman, (Th, IKh, S, Msb, and so
in some copies of the K,) or of a female slave, (so
in other copies of the K,) but it is not restricted
to the latter, (TA,) aor.
بَغِىَ, (JK, Msb,) inf. n.
بِغَآءٌ, (IKh, JK, S, Mgh, Msb, TA,) or بَغْىٌ, (ISd,
K,) [but the former, only, is commonly known,]
She committed fornication, or adultery; she prostituted herself; (JK, S, Mgh, Msb, K;) because
she who does so transgresses her proper bounds;
(TA;) as also ↓ بَاغَتْ, (IKh, S, * Msb, K,) inf. n.
بِغَآءٌ (IKh, K) and مُبَاغَاةٌ, (K,) said of a female
slave: (Msb:) or مباغاة signifies the committing
fornication, or adultery, with another. (KL.)
It is said in the Kur [xxiv. 33], وَلَا تُكْرِهُو فَتَيَاتِكُمْ
عَلَى البِغَآءِ [And compel not ye your young women
to prostitute themselves]. (Mgh.) And you say,
↓ خَرَجَتِ المَرْأَةُ تُبَاغِى [The woman went forth for
prostituting herself]. (S.) Accord. to the Jema etTefáreek, بِغَآءٌ signifies The knowing of a woman's
committing fornication or adultery, or prostituting
herself, and approving, or being content: but this,
if correct, is an amplification in speech. (Mgh.)
―
-b9-  بَغَى الجُرْحُ, (JK, S, Msb,) aor.
بَغَىَ, inf. n. بَغْىٌ,
(JK,) The wound swelled, (S,) and became in a

-b10-  بَغَى, (K,) aor.
بَغِىَ, inf. n. بَغْىٌ, (TA,)

may mean what do we seek, or desire? (TA.) ―
-b2-
Also, (K,) inf. n. بَغْىٌ, (TA,) He looked at a

art pretty, and mayest thou not be smitten by the

the verb in this instance belongs to art. بوغ or art.

7
انبغى is said in the S to be quasi-pass. of
بَغَيْتُهُ, like as اِنْكَسَرَ is of كَسَرْتُهُ; and Esh-Shiháb
says of the aor. that it is quasi-pass. of بَغَاهُ, aor.
يَبْغِيهِ, in the sense of طَلَبَهُ: (TA:) [Fei says,] it
has been asserted that انبغى is quasi-pass. of بَغَى;
but a verb of the measure انفعل is not used as a
quasi-pass. unless it implies effort, and the consequence of an action, as in the case of كَسَرْتُهُ, of
which the quasi-pass. is اِنْكَسَرَ; which انبغى does
not: some, however, allow its being thus used:
(Msb:) accord. to Zj, it is as though it were syn.
with اِنْطَلَبَ, as quasi-pass. of طَلَبَ, and means
It was, or became, suitable, fit, meet, or proper;
(Zj, TA;) [or right, and allowable; and good:
or very requisite: (see explanations of exs. following:) or it behooved: and] it was, or became,
facilitated, or easy; (Er-Rághib, K;) and practicable, or manageable. (Er-Rághib, TA.) Accord.
to some, this verb is not used in the pret. tense,
but only in the aor.: it is reckoned among verbs
imperfectly inflected: (Msb, TA:) but the pret.
is mentioned by AZ and Sb and Zj, and by ElKhattábee on the authority of Ks; and was often
used by Esh-Sháfi'ee: it is, however, very rare.
(TA.) You say, يَنْبَغِى لَكَ أَنْ تَفْعَلَ كَذَا [It is
suitable to thee, or is fit, meet, or proper, &c.,
for thee, or it behooveth thee, that thou shouldst
do such a thing]. (S, TA.) And, accord. to Zj,
اِنْبَغَى لِفُلَانٍ أَنْ يَفْعَلَ, as meaning It was, or became, suitable to such a one, or fit, meet, or proper,
for him, that he should do, or to do, such a thing.
(TA.) And مَا يَنْبَغِى لَكَ أَنْ تَفْعَلَ هٰذَا, (Lh, K,)
and ↓ ما يُبْتَغَى, (K, TA,) with fet-h to the غ,
(TA,) and ما انْبَغَى, and ↓ ما ابْتُغِىَ; (Lh, K;) of
which four phrases, the first is given by Lh as
explanatory of the third and fourth, and means,
accord. to Esh-Shiháb, It is not right, proper,
fit, or meet, nor allowable, for thee that thou
shouldst do this, or to do this; and it is not good
for thee &c.; but he adds that only the aor. has
been heard from the Arabs in this sense. (TA.)
And يَنْبَغِى أَنْ يَكُونَ كَذَا It is very requisite
that it should be so, or that such a thing ought
be; [or it ought to be so, or such a thing ought
to be; it behooves that it should be so, or such a
thing behooves;] it is not well that such a thing
should be neglected, or left undone. (Msb.) And
Ks is related to have heard, from the Arabs, the
phrase, مَا يَنْبَغِى أَنْ يَكُونَ كَذَا, meaning It is
not right that it should be so, or that such a thing
should be: or it is not good &c. (Msb.) It is
said in the Kur [xxxvi. 69], وَمَا عَلَّمْنَاهُ الشِّعْرَ وَمَا
يَنْبَغِى لَهُ, i. e. [And we have not taught him
poetry, or versification], nor is it right, proper,
fit, or meet, for him: (Bd:) or nor is it easy to
him, (Bd, Jel, Er-Rághib,) or practicable to him.
(Bd, Er-Rághib.)

company of men, to seek a thing for him, and

بَغْىٌ [originally an inf. n. (see 1)] Much of
rain; or much rain: in [some of] the copies of
the K, البطر is erroneously put for المطر: (TA:)
[and in some, البَغِىُّ for البَغْىُ: in a MS. copy,
I find البَغِىُّ الكَثِيرُ مِنَ المَطَرِ: and in the CK,
البَغِىُّ الكَثِيْرُ من النَّظَرِ:] or بَغْىُ السَّمَآءِ signifies
the main portion, (As, S,) or the vehemence, and
the main portion, (Lh, JK, TA,) of the rain of
the sky. (As, Lh, JK, S, TA.) Hence the saying,
دَفَعْنَا بَغْىَ السَّمَآءِ خَلْفَنَا (As, S, TA) or عَنَّا (Lh,
TA) [lit. We drove away the main portion, or
the vehemence, and the main portion, of the rain
of the sky behind us or from us; meaning it was
driven away behind us or from us, or it departed;
as is shown in art. دفع].

“ sought; ” and if of the latter, originally meaning
“ seeking; ”] and therefore [in either case] not
admitting the affix ة: (TA:) A fornicatress, an
adulteress, or a prostitute; (JK, S, Mgh, Msb,
K;) as also ↓ بَغُوٌّ [of the measure فَعُولٌ, and

to such a person: (Msb:) pl. as above. (JK, S,
