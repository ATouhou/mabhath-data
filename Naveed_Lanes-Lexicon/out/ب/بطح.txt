word is pl. of أَبْطَحُ or of بَطْحَآءُ]: a phrase like
أَعْوَامٌ عُوَّمٌ. (As, A 'Obeyd, S.)
بَطِيحَةٌ: see أَبْطَحُ.
بَاطِحٌ applied to a man, i. q. ↓ مُنْبَطِحٌ [part. n.
of 7, q. v.]. (Ham p. 244.)
أَبْطَحُ, originally an epithet [and therefore imperfectly decl.], (M, TA,) that is, an epithet converted into a subst., and not used as an epithet,
(Ham p. 21,) A wide water-course, or channel
of a torrent, in which are fine, or minute, or
broken, pebbles; (S, A, K, and Ham ubi suprà;)
so called because the water goes in it to the right
and left; [i. e. spreads widely; see 7;] (AA;)
as also ↓ بَطْحَآءُ, (S, A, K, Ham,) fem. of the
former, and, like it, an epithet converted into a
subst.; (Ham ubi suprà;) and ↓ بَطِيحَةٌ, (S, K,)

of a torrent, in which are sand and pebbles; as
also ↓ بَطْحَآءُ: (Mgh:) or a wide place [app. in
a water-course]; as also ↓ بطحة [app. بَطْحَةٌ,
which is explained by Freytag, but without his
stating on what authority, as signifying a depressed place through which water flows, abounding with pebbles; as is also بِطْحَةٌ; and in like
manner Golius explains the former, but mentions
the latter as a pl. of بطيحة]: (Msb:) or, accord.
to AHn, the bottom of a water-course, or channel
of a torrent, producing no plants or herbage:
(TA:) or ↓ بَطْحَآءُ signifies soft earth of a valley,
such as has been drawn along by the torrents:
(ISd, TA:) or the soft pebbles in the bottom of
the water-course, or channel of a torrent, of a
valley; as also أَبْطَحُ: (IAth, TA:) or the soft
earth, such as has been drawn along by the torrents, in the bottom of a تَلْعَة [meaning a water-course &c.] and of a valley; and the أَبْطَح and
↓ بَطْحَآء of a valley are its earth and soft pebbles:
(En-Nadr, TA:) and accord. to AA, ↓ بَطِحٌ signifies sand in a بَطْحَآء: (TA:) the pl. is أَبَاطِحُ
and بِطَاحٌ (S, A, K) and بَطَائِحُ; (K;) the first
of these, and the second also, contr. to analogy,
being pls. of ابطح; (S;) or both are pls. of بطحآء,
contr. to analogy; (Ham p. 251;) or the first is
pl. of ابطح, formed after the manner of the pl.
of a subst. of this measure, though the sing. is
originally an epithet; (M, TA;) and the second,
as is asserted by more than one, is correctly pl.
of بطحآء, as is also بَطْحَاوَاتٌ; (TA;) and the
third is pl. of بطيحة. (M, TA.)
مُنْبَطِحٌ [part. n. of 7, q. v.: often applied to
