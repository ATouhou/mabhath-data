or midst, [which is the best part,] of the دار [i. e.
abode, or district, or country, &c.], (K, TA,) and
became possessed of mastery, dominion, or authority, and power, over it. (TA.) Fr, however,
makes تَبَحْبُحٌ to be from ٰالبَاحَةُ [q. v.], not from
a reduplicative root. (TA.) ―
-b2-  تبحبح also signifies (assumed tropical:)  He was, or became, settled, or established,
in authority and power, (syn. تَمَكَّنَ,) in alighting,
and taking up his abode, or sojourning; (S, K,
TA;) and was, or became, [established] in the
middle, or midst, [or best part,] of the place of
abode; (TA;) and so ↓ بحبح. (K, TA.) ―
-b3-  Also
(tropical:)  He took a wide, an ample, or a large, range.
(A.) ―
-b4-  [Hence,] تبحبح الحَيَا (assumed tropical:)  The rain became of
wide extent, and had influence upon the land. (TA,
from a trad.) ―
-b5-  And تَبَحْبَحَتِ العَرَبُ فِى لُغَاتِهَا
(tropical:)  The Arabs were copious, or took a wide range,
in their dialects. (A.) ―
-b6-  And تبحبح فِى المَجْدِ
(assumed tropical:)  He became in an ample state of glory, honour,
or dignity. (TA.) ―
-b7-  An Arab of the desert said,
of a woman in labour, تَرَكْتُهَا تَبَحْبَحُ عَلَى أَيْدِى
القَوَابِلِ [app. (assumed tropical:)  I left her obtaining delivery by
the hands of the midwives]. (AZ, TA.)
بُحَّةٌ: see أَبَحُّ.
بُحَّةٌ (S, A, L, K) and ↓ بُحَاحٌ (L) Hoarseness,
roughness, harshness, or gruffness, of the voice;
(E, K;) which is sometimes natural: or the former
is applied absolutely, and the latter to that which
arises from disease. (L.) You say, فِى صَوْتِهِ بُحَّةٌ
[In his voice is hoarseness, &c.]. (S, A.)
بُحَاحٌ: see بُحَّةٌ.
بَحْبَحِىٌّ (assumed tropical:)  Ample in expenditure: and having
an ample place of abode. (Fr, K.)
بُحْبُوحٌ: see what next follows.
بُحْبُوحَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  The middle, or midst, [or best part,]
syn. وَسَطٌ, (A'Obeyd, S, A, K,) of an abode, or a
district, or country, (S, A,) or a place, (K,) and
of a place where one alights and abides, (TA,)
and of Paradise, and of anything, and the best
part thereof; (A'Obeyd, TA;) [like وَسَطٌ, by
which it is explained; because what is between
the two extremes is generally the best: it may be
well rendered the heart, or very heart, of a thing;]
and ↓ بُحْبُوحٌ, also, has the former of these significations [and by implication the other likewise].
(TA, voce بُؤْبُؤٌ, where see an ex.) Jereer says,
قَوْمِى تَمِيمٌ هُمُ القَوْمُ الذَّينَ هُمُ
يَنْفُونَ تَغْلِبَ عَنْ بُحْبُوحَةِ الدَّارِ
[My people are Temeem: they are the people who
drive away Teghlib from the middle, or best part,
of the country]. (S.) [It is said in the A, that
this word, as syn. with وَسَطٌ, in relation to an
abode or the like (دار), is tropical; but I see no
reason for this, unless by وسط be meant the “best
part.”]
أَبَحٌّ, applied to a man, (S, L, K,) or أَبَحٌّ الصَّوْتِ,
(A,) Having a hoarse, rough, harsh, or gruff,

قَرَوْا أَضْيَافَهُمْ رَبَحًا بِبُحٍّ
يَعِيشُ بِفَضْلِهِنَّ الحَىُّ سُمْرِ
[They entertained their guests with young weaned
she-camels, on the superabundant remains of
which the tribe lived, by means of tawny-coloured
gaming-arrows whereby the lots that determined
who should afford the entertainment were divided:
or, accord. to the TA, ربحا here signifies fat, as
a subst.; but this is inconsistent with the affixed
pronoun relating to it]. (S.) ―
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  Fat, as an
epithet, not a subst. (K.) ―
-b3-  كِسْرٌ أَبَحُّ (assumed tropical:)  [A portion of a limb, &c.,] having much fat. (TA.)
