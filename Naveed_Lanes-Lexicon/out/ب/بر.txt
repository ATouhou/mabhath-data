He overcame them: (T, S, M, K:) he subdued

(TA;) by actions or sayings; (TA;) as also
↓ بَرَّهُمْ, aor. يَبُرُّ: (T, K, TA:) he was refractory,

trad.) You say, ابرّ عَلَى خَصْمِهِ [He overcame
his adversary]. (A.) And ابرّ عَلَيْهِمْ شَرًّا [He
overcame them in evil]: and hence ابرّ is used
in the sense of فَجَرَ [he transgressed, &c.]; as
in the saying of a poet,
فَلَسْتُ أُبَالِى مَنْ أَبَرَّ وَ مَنْ فَجَرْ

Pious [towards his father or parents, and (tropical:)  towards God; (tropical:)  obedient to God, serving God, or
rendering religious service to God; (see 1;) and
kind, or good and affectionate and gentle in
behaviour, towards his kindred; and good in his
dealings with strangers]; good, just, righteous,
virtuous, or honest: (Msb:) true, or veracious:
(M, Msb, K:) and both signify also abounding in
بِرّ [or filial piety, &c.]: (K:) the former is [said
to be] a stronger epithet than the latter, like as
عَدْلٌ is stronger than عَادِلٌ: (B:) [but its pl.
shows that it is not, like عَدْلٌ, originally an
inf. n.: it is a regular contraction of بَرِرٌ, like
as بَارٌّ is of بَارِرٌ:] the fem. of each is with ة: (Lh,
M:) the pl. (of the former, S, M, Msb, or of the
latter, B) is أَبْرَاٌ; and (of the latter, S, M, Msb,
or of the former, B) بَرَرَةٌ: (S, M, Msb, K:) the
former pl. is often specially applied to saints,
those who abstain from worldly pleasures, and
devotees; and the latter, to the recording angels.
(B.) You say, أَنَا بَرٌّ بِوَالِدِى, and ↓ بَارٌّ, I am
characterized by filial piety, dutifulness, or obedience, to my father: (S, M, A: *) the latter is
mentioned on the authority of Kr; but some
disallow it. (M, TA.) And الأُمُّ بَرَّةٌ بِوَلَدِهَا [The
mother is maternally affectionate to her child, or
offspring]. (S.) And رَجُلٌ بَرٌّ بِذِى قَرَابَتِهِ, and
↓ بَارٌّ, A man who behaves towards his kindred
with kindness, or goodness and affection and gentleness, and regard for their circumstances. (T.)
And رَجُلٌ بَرٌّ سَرٌّ A man who treats with goodness
and affection and gentleness, and rejoices, or
gladdens, his brethren: pl. بَرُّونَ سَرُّونَ. (S, * K, *
TA, in art. سر.) And بَرٌّ فِى قَوْلٍ, and فِى يَمِينٍ,
and ↓ بَارٌّ, True, or veracious, in a saying, and in
an oath. (Msb.) And يَمِينٌ بَرَّةٌ and ↓ بَارَّةٌ [A
true oath; or an oath that proves true]. (Ham
p. 811.) البَرُّ is also a name of God; (M, K;)
meaning (assumed tropical:)  The Merciful, or Compassionate:
(M:) or the Very Benign to his servants;
(IAth;) the Ample in goodness or beneficence:
(B:) البَارُّ is not so used. (IAth.) It is said in
a trad., تَمَسَّحُوا بِالأَرْضِ فَإِنَّهَا بَرَّةٌ بِكُمْ (assumed tropical:)  Wipe yourselves with the dust, or earth, [in performing the
ceremony termed التَّيَمُّمُ,] for it is benignant
towards you, like as the mother is to her children;
meaning, ye are created from it, and in it are
your means of subsistence, and to it ye return
after death: (IAth:) or the meaning is, that your
tents, or houses, are upon it, and ye are buried in
it. (M.)
-A2-  بَرٌّ Land; opposed to بَحْرٌ [as meaning “ sea ” and the like]: (S, Msb, K:) from بِرٌّ
signifying “ ampleness,” “ largeness,” or “ extensiveness; ” (Esh-Shiháb [El-Khafájee], MF;)
or the former word is the original of the latter.
(B, TA. [See the latter word.]) [Hence, بَرًّا وَ بَحْرًا
By land and by sea.] ―
-b2-  A desert, or deserts; a
waste, or wastes. (T, TA. [See also بَرِّيَّةٌ, voce
بَرِّيٌّ.]) So, accord. to Mujáhid [and the Jel] in
words of the Kur [vi. 59], وَ يَعْلَمُ مَا فِى البَرِّ وَ البَحْرِ
And He knoweth what is in the desert, or deserts,
and the towns, or villages, in which is water, (T,
TA,) or which are upon the rivers. (Jel.) [So
too in the phrase نَبَاتُ البَرِّ The plants, or herbage,
of the desert or waste; the wild plants or herbage.
And عَسَلُ البَرِّ Honey of the desert; wild honey.
And حَيَوَانُ البَرِّ The animal, or animals, of the
desert; the wild animal or animals.] ―
-b3-  A wide
tract of land. (Bd in ii. 41.) ―
-b4-  [The open
country; opposed to بَحْرٌ as meaning the
“ cities,” or “ towns,” “ upon the rivers: ” see the
latter word.] ―
-b5-  Elevated ground, open to view.
(T.) ―
-b6-  The tract, or part, out of doors, or where
one is exposed to view; contr. of كِنٌّ: used by
the Arabs indeterminately; [without the article
ال;] as in the phrase, جَلَسْتُ بَرًّا (Lth, T) meaning I sat outside the house; (A;) and خَرَجْتُ بَرًّا
(Lth, T) meaning I went forth outside the [house
or] town, (A,) or into the desert: (TA:) but [Az
says,] these are post-classical phrases, which I
have not heard from the chaste-speaking Arabs of
the desert. (T.) ―
-b7-  You say also, أَرِيدُ جَوًّا وَ يُرِيدُ بَرًّا
I desire concealment, or secrecy, and he desires
publicity. (A.)
بُرٌّ Wheat; and the grain of wheat; syn. قَمْحٌ,
(S, * Msb,) or حِنْطَةٌ; (M, K;) but it is a more
chaste word than قَمْحٌ and حِنْطَةٌ: (M:) pl. of
بُرَّةٌ; (S, M;) or [rather] بُرَّةٌ is the n. un. [signifying a grain of wheat, like قَمْحَةٌ]: (IDrd,
Msb:) the pl. of بُرٌّ is أَبْرَارٌ; (K;) or this pl. is
allowable on the ground of analogy, accord. to
Mbr, but is disallowed by Sb. (S.) It is said in
a prov., (TA,) هُوَ أَقْصَرُ مِنْ برَّةٍ [He, or it, is
shorter than a grain of wheat]. (A, TA.) And
you say, أَطْعمَنَا ابْنَ بُرَّةٍ He fed us with bread.
(A.)
بِرٌّ inf. n. of 1: (T, S, M, &c.:) it is said by
some to signify primarily Ampleness, largeness, or
extensiveness; whence بَرٌّ as opposed to بَحْرٌ:
then, ―
-b2-  Benevolent and solicitous regard or treatment or conduct [to parents and others; i. e. piety
to parents; and (tropical:)  towards God]: and goodness,
or beneficence: and kindness, or good and affectionate and gentle behaviour, and regard for the
circumstances of another: (Esh-Shiháb [El-Khafájee], MF:) or بَرٌّ, as opposed to بَحْرٌ, [or as
signifying “ a wide tract of land,” (Bd in ii. 41,)]
is the original of بِرٌّ, (Bd in ii. 41, B, TA,) which
signifies ample, large, or extensive, goodness or
beneficence, (Z, in the Ksh, ii. 41, [but he regards
it as the original of بَرٌّ,] and Bd on the same
passage, and B, K, TA,) to men; (TA;) or comprehending every kind of goodness: (Ksh and
Bd ubi suprà:) and hence it is said to be in three
things: in the service of God: in paying regard
to relations; acting well to them: and in dealing
with strangers: (Bd ubi suprà:) or every deed
that is approved: (Ksh and Bd in ii. 172:) and
[particularly] obedience to God: (T, S, M, &c.:
[see also بَرَّةُ:]) [and every incumbent duty: and
hence,] the pilgrimage to Mekkeh: (K:) and
fidelity to an engagement: (TA:) also a gratuitous gift, or favour; and a bounty, or benefit;
syn. فَضْلٌ; (Msb;) and إِحْسَانٌ; as also ↓ مَبَرَّةٌ
[an inf. n., but when used as a simple subst. its
pl. is مَبَارٌ and مَبَرَّاتٌ]. (Har p. 94.) In the Kur
[ii. 172], where it is said, لُكِنَّ البِرَّ مَنْ آمَنَ بِااللّٰهِ,
by البرّ is meant ذَا البِرِّ [i. e. But the pious, or
obedient to God, is he who believeth in God]; (T,
M, Ksh, Bd, Jel;) and some read البَارَّ: (Ksh,
Bd, Jel:) or the meaning is, لكنّ البِرَّ بِرُّ من آمن
با للّٰه i. e. but the obedience of which it behooveth
one to be mindful is the obedience of him who
believeth in God: (Sb, T, IJ, M, Ksh, Bd:) and
this explanation is preferable to the former. (Bd.)
It is said in a prov., (T, S,) لَا يَعْرِفُ هِرًّا مِنْ بِرٍ,
(S, A, K, but in the T and M مَا is put in the
place of لا,) meaning He knows not him who dislikes him, or hates him, from him who behaves
towards him with kindness, or goodness and affection and gentleness, and regard for his circumstances: (S, M, A, K, * TA:) or undutiful conduct
to a parent from gentleness, or courtesy: (ElFezáree, T, K:) or altercation, (T,) or dislike, or
hatred, (K,) from honourable treatment: (T, K:)
or the calling of sheep, or goats, from the driving
of them: (IAar, S, K:) or the driving of sheep,
or goats, from the calling of them: (Yoo, T:) or
the calling of them to water from the calling of
them to fodder; (K;) which last rendering is
agreeable with an explanation of بِرٌّ by IAar [mentioned in the T]; (TA;) and ↓ بِرْبِرٌ, also, has
the signification here assigned to بِرٌّ: (K, * TA:)
or الهَرْهَرَة from البَرْبَرَة; (A'Obeyd, T, K;) i. e.
the crying of sheep from the crying of goats:
(A'Obeyd, T:) or the cat from the rat, or mouse:
(IAar, T, M, K:) and بِرٌّ also signifies the [species
of rat called] جُرَذ: (Aboo-Tálib, T, K:) or a
small animal resembling the rat or mouse: (M:)
and the young of the fox. (K.) ―
-b3-  Also Good,
as a subst., not an adj.; syn. خَيْرٌ; (Sh, T, Mgh,
Msb, K;) which comprises all that has been said
in explanation of بِرٌّ (Sh, T, Mgh) as used in the
saying of Mohammad, عَليْكُمْ بِالصِّدْقِ فَإِنَّهُ يَهْدِى
إِلَى البِرِّ [Keep ye to truth; for it guides to good,
or to a good, or right, state]: some render it in
this instance by الخَيْر; and some, by الصَّلَاح. (Sh,
T.) It signifies also The good of the present life,
consisting in spiritual and worldly blessings, and
of that which is to come, consisting in everlasting
enjoyment in Paradise: so in the Kur iii. 86:
(T:) or [simply] Paradise. (K.) ―
-b4-  Also The
heart; or the mind. (K.) So in the saying,
هُوَ مُطْمَئِنُّ البِرِّ [He is quiet, or at rest, in heart,
or mind]. (TA.)
بَرَّةُ a subst. in the sense of البِرُّ, (S, M, K,)
meaning Obedience [&c.]; (K;) determinate, (S,
K,) being a proper name; for which reason, combined with its being of the fem. gender, it is
imperfectly decl. (M.) [It is opposed to فَجَارِ.
See a verse of En-Nábighah in the first paragraph
of art. حمل.]
بَرِيرٌ [a coll. gen. n.] The fruit of the أَرَاك [q. v.],
(S, M,) in a general sense: (M:) or the first
thereof; (K;) [i. e.] the first that appears, or
when it first appears, and is sweet: (M:) or
when it has become hard: (Msb:) or when it is
larger in its berries (حَبّ) than such as is termed
كَبَاث, and smaller in its clusters; having a
round, small, hard stone, a little larger than the
حِمَّص; its cluster filling the hand: (AHn, M:)
n. un. with ة. (AHn, S, M, Msb.)
بُرَّى A good, sweet, or pleasant, word or expression or saying: (K:) from بِرٌّ signifying “ benevolent and solicitous regard or treatment or conduct. ” (TA.)
[
بَرِّىٌّ Of, or belonging to, or relating to, the
land as opposed to the sea or a great river. ―
-b2-
And Of, or belonging to, or relating to, the desert
or waste; growing, or living, or produced, in the
desert or waste; wild, or in an uncultivated state. ―
-b3-
And hence,] أَرْضٌ بَرِّيَّةٌ Uncultivated land; without seed-produce, and unfruitful; without green
herbs or leguminous plants and without waters;
contr. of رِيفِيَّةٌ. (IAar, M, K. *) And, simply,
↓ بَرَّيَّةٌ, (S, M, A, Msb, K,) and ↓ بَرِّيتٌ, (A'Obeyd,
IAar, Sh, S, K,) the latter a variation of the former,
the ى being made quiescent, and the ة therefore
being changed into ت, as in عِفْرِيتٌ, originally
عِفْرِيَةٌ, (S,) a rel. n. from بَرٌّ, (Sh, T, Msb,) A
desert; a waste; a spacious tract of ground
without herbage; syn. صَحْرَآءُ: (S, M, A, Msb,
K:) [see also بَرٌّ:] or a tract nearer to the desert
(البَرّ) than it is to water: (Sh, T:) [but some
write the latter word ↓ بِرِّيتٌ; and it is said that]
بِرِّيتُ, (T and K in art. برت,) of the same measure
as سِكِّيتٌ, (K in that art.,) signifies flat, even, or
level, land: (T, K:) or a barren, flat, even, or
level, land: a poet says,
بِرِّيتُ أَرْضٍ بَعْدَهَا بِرِّيتُ
[A barren, flat land, after which is a second
barren, flat land]: (T:) ISd says that بِرِّيتٌ, in
a poem of Ru-beh, [from which the ex. given
above is probably taken,] is of the measure فِعْلِيتٌ
from البَرُّ; and that art. برت is not the place in
which it should be mentioned: (TA:) Lth says,
البَرِّيتُ is a noun derived from البَرِّيَّةُ; the ى
becoming quiescent, and the ة becoming an inseparable ت, as though it were a radical letter, as
in the case of عِفْرِيَةٌ, which thus becomes عِفْرِيتٌ:
(T, TA:) the pl. of برّيّة is بَرَارِىُّ; and that of برّيت
is بَرَارِيتُ. (S.)
بَرِّيَّةٌ and بَرِّيتٌ and بِرِّيتٌ: see بَرِّىٌّ.
بَرَّارٌ as signifying A possessor of بُرّ, i. e. wheat,
though agreeable with prevailing analogy, is not
allowable, not being sanctioned by usage. (Sb,
M.)
بَرَّانِىٌّ External; or outward: apparent; public. (T.) Hence the saying of Selmán, (T,) مَنْ
أَصْلَحَ جَوَّانِيَّهُ أَصْلَحَ اللّٰهُ بَرَّانِيَّهُ (T, A, K) Whoso
maketh his inner man (سَرِيرَتَهُ) to be good, God
will make his outward man (عَلَانِيَتَهُ) to be good.
(T.) بَرَّانِىٌّ is a rel. n., irregularly formed, (K,)
from بَرٌّ signifying “ elevated ground, open to
view; ” and جَوَّانِىٌّ, from جَوٌّ signifying “ any
low, or depressed, part of the ground. ” (T.)
You say, افْتَتَحَ البَابَ البَرَّانِىَّ He opened the
outer door. (A.)
بَرْبَرُ, (S, K,) or البَرْبَرُ, (Mgh, Msb,) [a coll. gen.
proper name, of which the n. un., or rel. n., is
↓ بَرْبَرِىٌّ,] a foreign word, (S,) [probably of African
origin, the primary form of which is the source
of

say, from بَرْبَرَةٌ in speech; (TA; [see R. Q. 1;])
and البَرَابِرَةُ, (S, M, Msb, K,) the pl. of بَرْبَرُ, (K,)
or of البَرْبَرُ, (Msb,) [or of بَرْبَرِىٌّ, agreeably with
what follows and with analogy,] the ة being
added because the sing. is a foreign word, or [so
in the M and TA, but in the S “ and,”] a rel. n.,
(S, M,) but it may be elided; [so that one may
say البَرَابِرُ;] (S;) A certain people, (S, M, Mgh,
Msb, K,) of the inhabitants of El-Maghrib [or
Northern Africa west of Egypt], (Mgh, * Msb, K, *)

of religion, and littleness of knowledge: (Mgh:)

Diodorus Siculus and Strabo,] between the Abyssinians and the Zinj, who amputate [the glans of]
the penis, and make it a dowry for a wife. (K.)

races. The appellation of البَرَابِرَةُ, sing. ↓ بَرْبَرِىٌّ, is
also applied by late historians, and in the present
day, to The races inhabiting the portion of the
valley of the Nile which we commonly call Nubia.]
