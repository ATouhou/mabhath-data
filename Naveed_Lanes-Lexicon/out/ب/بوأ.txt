بَآءَ إِلَيْهِ, (M, Mgh, * Msb, * K,) aor. يَبُوْءُ, (M,
Mgh, Msb,) inf. n. بَوْءٌ, (M, Mgh,) He returned,
went back, or came back, (M, Mgh, Msb, K,)
to it, (M, K, *) namely, a thing: (M:) or he
withdrew [from a person or persons, or a place,]
to it, or him; or, perhaps, he made himself solely
and peculiarly a companion, or an associate, to
him, or it; syn. اِنْقَطَعَ [q. v.]: (K:) but in
some copies of the K, the latter explanation is
connected with the former by وَ [and] instead of
أَو. (TA.) وَبَاؤُوا بِغَضَبٍ مِنَ اللّٰهِ [in the Kur
ii. 58 and iii. 108] means And they returned
with anger from God; (Akh, S, Bd in ii. 58,
and Jel in the same and in iii. 108;) i. e. the
anger of God came upon them: (Akh, S:) or
they returned deserving anger from God: (Bd
in iii. 108:) or they became deserving of anger
from God: from بَآءَ فُلَانٌ بِفُلَانٍ such a one was
deserving of being, or fit to be, slain in retaliation
for such a one, (Ksh and Bd in ii. 58,) because
his equal: (Ksh ibid.:) the primary signification
of بَوْءٌ being [said to be] that of equalling, or being
equal with. (Bd in ii. 58.) [See a similar phrase,
also from the Kur, below.] ―
-b2-  بُؤْتُ بِهِ إِلَيْهِ [I
returned with it to him: and hence,] I returned
it, took it back, or brought it back, to him; (M,
K;) as also ↓ أَبَأْتُهُ, (Th, M, K,) and بُؤْتُهُ, (Ks,
M, K,) but this last is rare. (M.) ―
-b3-  بَآءَ بِإِثْمِهِ,
aor. and inf. n. as above, (T, S,) signifies, accord.
to Akh, He returned [laden] with his sin: (S:)
or, accord. to As, he acknowledged it, or confessed
it: (T:) or, accord. to others, (TA,) بَآءَ بِذَنْبِهِ,
(T, * M, Msb, K,) aor. as above, inf. n. بَوْءٌ and
بَوَآءٌ, (M, K,) he bore, or took upon himself, the
burden of his sin, or crime, or offence; syn.
اِحْتَمَلَهُ; (Aboo-Is-hák, T, M, K, TA;) and became
[as though he were] the abiding-place thereof:
(TA:) or he became burdened, or laden, with it:
(Msb:) or he became, or made himself, answerable, responsible, or accountable, for it, by an
inseparable obligation; syn. اِلْتَزَمَ بِهِ; for the primary signification of بَوَآءٌ is [asserted to be] لُزُومٌ
[i. e. adhesion, &c.]; and it is afterwards used in
every case [so as to imply a meaning of this
kind] according to the exigency of that case; as
is said in the Nh, and expressly stated by Z and
Er-Rághib: (TA:) or he acknowledged it, or
confessed it. (M, K.) إِنِّى أُرِيدُ أَنْ تَبُوْءَ بِإِثْمِى
وَ إِثْمِكَ, in the Kur v. 35, means Verily I desire
that thou return [laden] with the sin committed
against me in slaying me, and thy sin which thou
hast committed previously: (Jel:) or I desire
that thou shouldst bear (تَحْمِلَ) my sin if I were
to extend my hand towards thee, and thy sin in
extending thy hand towards me: or the sin committed against me in slaying me, and thy sin for
which thine offering was not accepted: and each
noun is in the place of a denotative of state; i. e.,
[it means] that thou return involved in the two
sins; bearing them: and perhaps the speaker may
have meant, if that must inevitably take place, I
desire that it may be thine act, not mine; so that
the real meaning is, that it should not be his, not
that it should be his brother's: or by the إِثْمٌ may
be meant the punishment thereof; for the desire
of the punishment of the disobedient is allowable:
(Bd:) accord. to Th, the meaning is, if thou
have determined upon slaying me, the sin will be
in thee, not in me. (M.) فَبَاؤُوا بِغَضَبٍ عَلَى غَضَبٍ
[in the Kur ii. 84] is explained by Aboo-Is-hák
as meaning So they bore the burden of anger
upon anger; syn. اِحْتَمَلُوا; this being said by him
to be the proper signification of the verb: or, as
some say, the meaning is, [they bore the burden
of] sin for which they deserved the fire [of Hell]
following upon sin for which they deserved the
same: or they returned [laden with anger upon
anger]: (T:) or they became deserving of anger
upon anger. (Ksh.) [See a similar phrase, also
from the Kur, above.] It is said in a form of
prayer, أَبُوْءُ إِلَيْكَ بِنِعْمَتِكَ, meaning I acknowledge,
or confess, to Thee thy favour [towards me, as
imposing an obligation upon me]. (Mgh.) You
say also, بَآءٌ بِحَقِّهِ; (S;) and بِدِّمِهِ; (M, K;) He
acknowledged, or confessed, [himself to be answerable, responsible, or accountable, for] his right,
due, or just claim; (S;) and so [for] his blood:
(M, K:) the verb expresses acknowledgment, or
confession, always of something for which its
agent is, as it were, indebted, or answerable; not
the contrary. (S.) ―
-b4-  بَآءَ بِكَفِّى, in a poem of
Sakhr-el-Gheí, means It [referring to a sword]
became in my hand; my hand became to it a
مَبَآءَة, i. e. مَأْوًى [or place of abode]; it returned,
and became in my hand: or, accord. to Ibn-
Habeeb, i. q. اِسْتَقَلَّ [app. a mistranscription for
اِسْتَقَرَّ it rested, or remained; the verb بآء in this
phrase being from بَوَآءٌ signifying لُزُومٌ, explained
above]. (Skr p. 16.)
-A2-  بَآءٌ also signifies It (a
thing, TA) suited, matched, tallied, corresponded,
or agreed. (K.) [Hence,] بَآءَ فُلَانٌ بِفُلَانٍ (inf. n.
بَوَآءٌ, TA) Such a one was the like, or equal, of
such a one, to be slain [in retaliation] for him:
(T:) or became his like, or equal, so that he was
slain [in retaliation] for him: (Mgh:) and was
slain for him, (AZ, T, S,) and his blood became a
compensation for the blood of the other: (T:) or
was deserving of being, or fit to be, slain in retaliation for him, (Ksh and Bd in ii. 58,) because his
equal: (Ksh ibid.:) or was slain for him, and so
became equal with him; (K, * TA;) as also ↓ أَبَآءَهُ,
and ↓ بَاوَأَهُ. (M, K.) One says, بُؤْبِهِ, i. e. Be
thou of such as are slain [in retaliation] for him.
(S.) And it is said in a prov., بَآءَتْ عَرَارِ بِكَحْلٍ
'Arári became slain for Kahl: these were two
cows, which smote each other with their horns,
and both died: the proverb is applied to any two
that become equal. (S in this art.; and the same
and K in art. عر. [See also Freytag's Arab.
Prov. i. 151.]) ―
-b2-  بَآءَ دَمَهُ بِدَمِهِ, (T, * M, K,)
inf. n. بَوْءٌ and بَوَآءٌ, (M,) He made his blood equal
with [or an equivalent for] his [i. e. another's]
blood [by shedding the former in retaliation].
(M, K.) And بَآءَهُ, [or بَآءَهُ بِهِ,] (M,) or به ↓ أَبَآءَهُ,
(T, S,) and به ↓ اِسْتِبَآءَهُ, (S,) He slew him [in
retaliation] for him; (T, S, M;) i. e., the slayer
for the slain. (S.) فُلَانًا بِفُلَانٍ ↓ أَبَآءَ [He slew such
a one in retaliation for such a one] is said when
the Sultán has retaliated for a man upon another
man: and ↓ أَبَآءَهُ, inf. n. إِبَآءَةٌ, signifies he (the
Sultán, or another,) slew him in retaliation. (T.)
-A3-  بَآءَ signifies also He exalted himself, or was
proud: app. formed by transposition [of the second
and third radical letters, the ى being changed
into ا,] from بَأَى. (Fr, T.)
2
بوّأهُ مَنْزِلًا He lodged him in an abode; (Fr,
T, M, K;) as also بوّاهُ فِى مَنْزِلٍ, (M, K,) and
مَنْزِلًا ↓ ابآءهُ: (T, * M, K:) or, as also بوّأ لَهُ مَنْزِلًا,
(the latter mentioned by Fr, T,) he prepared for
him an abode, (S, Mgh,) and assigned, or gave,
him a place therein: (S:) and بَوَّأْتُهُ دارًا and بوّاتُ
لَهُ دارًا I lodged him in a house: (Msb:) and
بَوَّأْتُكَ بَيْتًا I took for thee a house: and ↓ تَبَوَّآ
لِقَوْمِكُمَا بِمِصْرَ بُيُوتًا [in the Kur x. 87] means take
ye two, for your people, in Egypt, houses: (Akh,
T:) or ↓ تَبَوُّؤٌ [or تَبَوُّؤُ مَكَانٍ] signifies a man's
putting a mark upon a place, when it pleases him,
that he may abide there: (El-'Itreefee, T:) or
↓ تبوّأهُ he put it [a place] into a right, or proper,
state; and prepared it: (Sh, * T:) or بَيْتًا ↓ تبوّأ
he took a house as a place of abode, or as a dwelling: (Msb:) or مَنْزِلًا ↓ تبوّأ he looked for the
best place that could be seen, and the most level,
or even, and the best adapted by its firmness, for
his passing the night there, and took it as a place
of abode; (Fr, T;) or he took for himself a place
of abode; (T, Mgh;) or he alighted and sojourned
in a place of abode: and ↓ استبآءهُ he took it as a
مَبَآءَة [or place of abode]: (S:) and بوّأ المَكَانَ and
بِهِ ↓ ابآء (K) and ↓ تبوّأ [i. e. تبوّأ بِهِ] (Sh, T, K) he
alighted in the place, and stayed, or dwelt, in it:
(Sh, T, K:) or به ↓ ابآء he stayed, or dwelt, in it,
i. e., a place: (Akh, T:) and المَكَانَ ↓ تبوّأ he
alighted and abode in the place: (M:) [whence,
in the Kur lix. 9,] الدَّارَوَ الْإِيمَانَ ↓ وَالَّذِينَ تَبَوَّؤُوا
[and they who have made their abode in the City
of the Prophet and in the faith]; the faith being
likened to a place of abode; or the meaning may
be مَكَانَ الإِيمَانِ [the place of the faith]. (M.)
بَوَّأَهُمْ مَنْزِلًا (AZ, M) and منزلًا ↓ أَبَآءَهُمْ (AZ, TA)
also signify He alighted and abode with them by
the face, or front, of a mountain, where it rose
from its base, (AZ, M, TA,) or next to a river,
or brook. (AZ, TA.)
-A2-  [Hence, (see بَآءَةِ,)] بوّأ
(inf. n. تَبْوِيْءٌ, K) (assumed tropical:)  Inivit [feminam]: and he
married [a woman]; took [her] in marriage: syn.
نَكَحَ: (M, K:) and also تَزَّوَجَ. (TA. [There
mentioned as a distinct signification.]) The verb
is trans. in these two senses. (TK.)
-A2-  بوّأ الرُمْحَ
نَحْوَهُ He directed the spear towards him; (T, S;)
and (T) confronted him with it; (T, M, K;) and
prepared it, or made it ready [to thrust it towards
him]. (TA.)

-b2-  ابآء الإِبِلَ, (T, S, O, L, and so in some
copies of the K, in other copies of which we find
ابآء بِالْإِبِلِ,) inf. n. إِبَآءَةٌ, (T,) He brought back the
camels to the مَبَآءَة (T, S, O, L) or مَعْطِن, (K,)
both of which signify the place where they are
made to lie down, at the watering-place. (L.)
And ابآء الإِبِلَ, (T, M,) inf. n. as above, (T,) He
made the camels to lie down [in the مَبَآءَة], one
beside another. (T, M.) And ابآء عَلَيْهِ مَالَهُ He
drove back, or brought back, to their nightly
resting-place, for him, his cattle, (S, M, TA,)
i. e., his camels, or his sheep or goats. (S, TA.)
And [hence,] أَبَآءَ اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِمْ نَعَمًا لَا يَسَعُهَا المُرَاحُ
[God bestowed upon them cattle (i. e. camels &c.)
which the nightly resting-place thereof would not
contain]. (TA.) ―

ابآء الأَدِيمَ He put the skin, or hide, into the

تَبَاوَآ They two (namely, two slain men, M)
became equal [by being slain, one in retaliation
for the other]. (M, K.) It is said in a trad.,
أَمَرَهُمْ أَنْ يَتَبَاوَؤُوا; incorrectly related as being
يَتَبآءَوْا; (S, Mgh;) meaning He (the Prophet)
ordered them that they should be equal in retaliation, in their fighting: (Mgh:) the occasion of
the order was this: there was a conflict between
two tribes of the Arabs, and one of the two tribes
had superior power over the other, so they said,
“ We will not be content unless we slay, for the
slave of our party, the free of their party; and for
the woman, the man: ” A'Obeyd holds the former
reading to be the right. (T.)
10
استبآءهُ: see 2. ―
-b2-  In the following verse of
Zuheyr Ibn-Abee-Sulmà,
وَلَمْ أَرَجَارَ بَيْتٍ يُسْتَبَآءُ  فَلَمْ أَرَ مَعْشَرًا أَسَرُوا هَدِيًّا
ISk says that the هَدِىّ is one who is entitled to
respect, or honour, or protection; and that يستبآء
is syn. with ↓ يُتَبَوَّأُ, meaning whose wife is taken
as a wife [by another man]: but Aboo-'Amr EshSheybánee says that يستبآء is from البَوَآءُ, meaning
“ retaliation: ” [and accord. to this interpretation,
which is the more probable, the verse may be
rendered, And I have not seen a company of men
who have made captive one entitled to respect, or
honour, or protection, nor have I seen one who
has begged the protection of the people of a house,
or of a tent, slain in retaliation:] for, he says,
he came to them desiring to beg their protection,
and they took him, and slew him in retaliation
for one of themselves. (T.) See 1, near the end
of the paragraph. ―
-b3-  اِسْتَبَأْتُ الحَكَمَ, and بِالْحَكَم, I

بَآءٌ: see بَآءَةٌ.
-A2-  A libidinous man. (TA in باب
الالف الليّنة.)
-A3-  The name of the letter ب, q. v.;
as also بَا: pl. of the former بَآءَاتٌ; and of the
latter أَبْوَآءٌ. (TA ubi suprà.) The dim. is بُيَيَّةٌ,
meaning A little ب: and a ب faintly pronounced:
[and app. بُوَيَّةٌ also, as the medial radical is generally held to be و:] and in like manner is formed
the dim. of every similar name of a letter. (Lth,
on the letter حَآء, in TA, باب الالف اللينّة.)
بَآءَةٌ: see مَبَآءَةٌ, in three places.
-A2-  Also, (T, S,
M, Mgh, Msb, K,) and ↓ بَآءٌ, (IAar, T, S, M, K,)
and بَاهَةٌ, with the ء changed into ه, (TA,) and بَاهٌ,
(IAar, T, Msb,) with ا and ه, but IKt asserts this
last to be a mistranscription, (Msb, TA,) [though
it is of very frequent occurrence,] and IAmb says
that بَآءَةٌ is sing., or n. un., of بَآءٌ, and بَآءٌ [or بَآءَةٌ]
has for pl. بَآءَاتٌ, (TA,) (tropical:)  Coïtus conjugalis: and
marriage: syn. جِمَاعٌ (T, Msb) and نِكَاحٌ (As,
Fr, T, S, M, Mgh, K) and تَزْوِيجٌ: (T:) from بَآءَةٌ
signifying a place of abode; [see مَبَآءَةٌ;] (T, S, *
Mgh, Msb;) because it is generally in a place of
abode; (Mgh, Msb;) or because the man possesses
mastery, or authority, and power, over his wife,
like as he possesses the same over his house: (S,
Mgh, Msb: see 5:) بَآءَةٌ is applied [also] to the
marriage-contract; because he who takes a woman
in marriage lodges her in a place of abode. (T.)
[See also بَاهٌ, in art. بوه.] It is said in a trad.,
مَنِ اسْتَطَاعَ مِنْكُمُ البَآءَ ةَ فَلْيَتَزَّوجْ He who is able, of
you, to marry, let him marry: (T:) or a prefixed
noun is here suppressed; the meaning being, he
who finds [or is able to procure] the provisions
(مُؤَن) of marriage, let him marry. (Msb, TA.)
And one says, فُلَانٌ حَرِيصٌ عَلَى البَآءَةِ Such a one
is vehemently desirous of marriage. (As, T.)
بِيْئَةٌ a subst. from بَوَّأَهُ مَنْزِلًا. (M, K.) [See 2;
and] see also مَبَآءَةٌ. ―
-b2-  A mode, or manner, of
taking for oneself a place of abode: (M:) and
[hence,] a state, or condition. (AZ, T, S, M, K.)
You say, إِنَّهُ لَحَسَنُ البِيْئَةِ Verily he has a good
mode, or manner, of taking for himself a place of
abode: (M:) or verily he is of good state or
condition. (S.) And بَاتَ بِبِيْئَةِ He passed the
night in an evil state or condition (AZ, T, S, * M.)
بَوَآءٌ Equal; equivalent; like; alike; a match;
(Akh, T, S, M, Mgh, K;) and particularly, if
slain in retaliation for another. (M.) It is applied to one, and to two, and to more: so that
you say, فُلَانٌ بَوَآءٌ فُلَانٌ Such a one is the equal,
&c., of such a one if slain in retaliation for him:
(M:) and هُوَ بَوَآءٌ He is an equal, &c.; and so هِىَ
she: and هُمْ بَوَآءٌ They are equals, &c.; and so هُنَّ
they, referring to females: (Mgh:) and هُمْ بَوَآءٌ
فِى هٰذَا الأَمْرِ They are equals in this affair. (T.)
Hence, in a trad. of 'Alee, respecting witnesses,
إَذَ كَانُوا بَوَآءٌ When they are equals in number
and rectitude. (Mgh.) And مَا فُلَانٌ لِفُلَانٍ بِبَوَآءٌ
Such a one is not an equal, &c., to such a one.
(T.) And دَمُ فُلَانٍ بَوَآءٌ لِدَمِ فُلَانٍ The blood of
such a one is an equivalent for the blood of such a
one. (S.) And الجِرَاحَاتُ بَوَآءٌ Wounds are to be
retaliated equally: a trad. (T, Mgh.) And
القَوْمُ عَلَى بَوَآءِ The people, or company of men,
are in a state of equality. (T.) And قُسِمَ المَالُ
بَيْنَهُمْ عَلَى بَوَآءٍThe property was divided among
them equally. (T. [A similar ex. is given in the
Mgh, and explained in the same manner; but
there I find عَنْ بَوَآءٍ; perhaps a mistranscription.])
And كَلَّمْنَاهُمْ فَأَجَابُوا عَنْ بَوَآءٍ وَاحِدٍ [in a copy of
the M عَلَى بوآء واحد] We spoke to them, and
they replied with one reply: (T, S, O, K: *) i. e.,
their reply was not discordant: عَنْ being here
used in the sense of بِ. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Also Retaliation. (T.) [See 1, near the end of the paragraph:
as well as in other places.] It is related in a trad.,
that Jaafar Es-Sádik, being asked the reason of
the rage of the scorpion against the sons of Adam,
said, تُرِيدُ البَوَآءَ [It desires retaliation]; i. e., it
hurts like as it is hurt. (TA.)

or front, of a mountain, where it rises from its
base; [see بَوَّأَهُمْ مَنْزِلًا;] as also ↓ بَآءَةٌ. (T.)
