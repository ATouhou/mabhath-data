بُجْلٌ: see بَجَلٌ.
بَجَلْ is a noun (Mughnee) syn. with حَسْبُ:
(S, Mughnee, K: *) and is also a verbal noun syn.
with يَكْفِى. (Mughnee, K. *) You say بَجَلِى (S,
Mughnee, K) and بَجْلِى, (S, K,) meaning حَسْبِى
[My sufficiency, or a thing sufficing me, i. e.
sufficient for me, is such a thing]: (S, Mughnee,
K:) [it is said in the Ham, p. 145, as on the
authority of Akh, that they do not say بَجْلى;
but this is a mistranscription for بَجَلْنِى, as will
be seen from what follows:] and, using it as a
verbal noun, (Mughnee, K,) but this is rare,
(Mughnee,) you say بَجَلْنِى, meaning يَكْفِينِى [It
suffices me, or will suffice me]; (Mughnee, K;)
and بَجَلْكَ, meaning يَكْفِيكَ [It suffices thee, or
will suffice thee]: (K:) or, accord. to Akh, they
say بَجَلْكَ, like as they say, قَطْكَ; but not بَجَلْنِى,
like قَطْنِى: (S:) or the ن in بَجَلْنِى is absolutely
necessary accord. to him who says that بَجَلٌ is a
verbal noun; and accord. to him who says that
this word is syn. with حَسْبُ, the ن is allowable.
(MF.) [See, under the words قَدْ and قَطْ, what
is said respecting قَدْنِى and قَطْنِى.] In the saying
of Jábir Ibn-Ra-lán Es-Simbisee,
لَمَّا رَأَتْ مَعْشَرًا قَلَّتْ حَمُولَتُهُمْ
قَالَتْ سُعَادُ أَهٰذَا مَالُكُمْ بَجَلَا
[When she saw a company whose beasts of burden
were few, So'ád said, Is this your property,
sufficing you?] meaning, when she saw the fewness of our camels: the last word occupies the
place of a denotative of state, and is made to end
thus by poetic license: Abu-l-'Alà says that this
word may be put in the accus. case as meaning
not exceeding what I see; or it may be for بَجَلِى,
after the manner of some of the Arabs who are
related, by Akh and others, to have said غُلَامَا for
غُلَامِى. (Ham pp. 299 and 300.) [See also 2:
and see بَجَلٌ.]
-A2-  It is also a particle, (Mughnee,)
meaning نَعَمْ [Yes; yea; or even so]. (Mughnee, K.)
بَجَلٌ Calumny, slander, or false accusation:
or this is with damm; (K;) i. e. ↓ بُجْلٌ; (T,
TA;) meaning a great calumny &c.; (K, * TA;)
and Az thinks that this may be a dial. var. of
بُجْرٌ, with which it is syn.; because ل and ر are
interchanged in many instances. (TA.) ―
-b2-  A
wonderful thing; syn. عَجَبٌ. (K.) ―
-b3-  ذُو البَحَلِ
denotes dispraise; meaning Content with mean
things; not desirous of the means of acquiring
eminence: (K:) or content that another should
manage affairs in his stead, and that he should be
a burden upon others, saying, Sufficient for me
(حَسْبِى [or بَجَلِى]) is that [state or condition]
wherein I am: (O, TA:) from a saying of Luk-
mán Ibn-'Ád; (O, K;) as is also ذُو البَجْلَةِ,
which denotes praise. (O, TA.)
بَجْلَةٌ A goodly, or beautiful, from or appearance, figure, person, mien, or external state or
condition: (Sh, K:) a pleasing aspect; goodliness,

S;) applied to a man; (As, TA;) or to an old

appearance, and advancement in years: (Mgh:)
or both signify an old man, who is a great lord
