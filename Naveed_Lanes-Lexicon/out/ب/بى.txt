بى2
بَيَّيْتُ الشَّىْءَ, (T, K,) inf. n. تَبْيِىٌّ, (K,) I
made the thing apparent, manifest, evident, clear,
plain, or perspicuous. (As, T, K*)
-A2-  Also, (K,
as in the TA,) or الشَّىءَ, ↓,تَبَّيَيْتُ (M, and so in
several copies of the K,) [both confirmed by what
follows,] i. q. تَعَمَّدْتُهُ [meaning I directed myself, or my course, or aim, to, or towards, the
thing; made for it, or towards it; made it my
object; &c.]. (M, K.) ―
-b2-  In the saying, حَيَّاكَ
اللّٰهُ وَ بَيَّاكَ, the phrase حياك اللّه means May God
make thee to have dominion: (S, M:) or may
God prolong thy life: (M:) and بيّاك means
اِعْتَمَدَكَ بِالتَّحِيَّةِ [may He bring thee prolongation
of life; lit. may He direct himself to thee, or the
like, with the gift of prolongation of life]; (As,
S;) or قَصَدَكَ بِالتَّحِيَّةِ [which is the same]: (IAar,
T:) or اِعْتَمَدَكَ بِالْمُلْكِ [may He bring thee dominion]; (M;) so too says IAar: (TA:) or may
He make thy state, or condition, to be good:
(TA:) or may He make thee to laugh: (T, S,
M, K:) so some say, accord. to As: (T:) and
it is related that these words were addressed
to Adam, in consequence of his having remained
a hundred years without laughing after his son
had been slain: (T, S:) so says A'Obeyd, on
the authority of Sa'eed Ibn-Jubeyr: (T:) or it
means may He bring thee near [unto Himself]:
(Aboo-Málik, As, T, M, K:) or may He bring
thee: (IAar, S, M:) or may He prepare for thee
an abode; i. q. بَوَّأَكَ, (K,) or بَوَّأَكَ مَنْزِلًا; the verb
being here altered in order to assimilate it to the
preceding verb, حَيَّا: (El-Ahmar, T, S:) this
explanation was approved by As: (S:) the meaning intended thereby is, may He lodge thee in an
abode in Paradise: (TA:) or, as some say, the
verb in this case is an imitative sequent to that
preceding it: (A'Obeyd, S K: *) but this is
naught: (K:) A'Obeyd says that in his opinion
it is not an imitative sequent, because an imitative
sequent is scarcely ever coupled with what precedes it by و. (S.) As an ex. of بَيَّا in the sense
of قَرَّبَ, Aboo-Málik cites this verse:
اَلْكِبْدَ وَالمَلْحَآءَ وَ السَّنَامَا  بَيَّا لَهُمْ إِذْ نَزَلُوا الطَّعَامَا
[He brought near to them, i. e., placed before
them, when they alighted, the food, namely, the
liver, and the flesh of the back extending from the
withers to the rump, and the hump]. (T.) And
IAar, explaining بيّاك as meaning قصدك بالتحيّة,
cites the following verse:
أَعْطَى عَطَآءَ اللَّحِزِ اللَّئِيمِ  أَبَا تَمِيمِ ↓ لَمَّا تَبَّيَيْنَا
(T.) Accord. to J, the meaning in this instances
may be agreeable with the explanation of بيّاك by
اعتمدك بالتحيّة [so that the verse may be rendered When we betook ourselves with salutation
to the father of Temeem, or, as the verse is cited
in the S, to the brother of Temeem (أَخَا تميم), he
gave the gift of the niggardly, the mean]: or it
may mean we brought: and the verb admits of
the same double rendering in other instances.
(TA.)
-A3-  بَيَّيْتُ بَآءً حَسَنَةً and حَسَنًا [I made, or
wrote, a beautiful ب]. (TA in باب الالف الليّنة.)
5
تبيّا It was, or became, apparent, manifest,
evident, clear, plain, or perspicuous, being near;
syn. تَبَيَّنَ مِنْ قُرْبٍ. (As, T.)
-A2-  See also 1, in
two places.
البَىٌّ The low, ignoble, mean, or contemptible,
man; as also ↓ اِبْنُ بَيَّانَ, (IAar, T, K) and ابن
هَيَّانَ, (IAar, T,) and ابن بَىّ, (K,) or هَىُّ بْنُ بَىّ,
and ↓ هَيَّانُ بْنُ بَيَّانَ: (Lth, T:) or the last two
signify he whose stock and branch are unknown:
(M:) or the same two, he who is unknown, and
whose father also is unknown: (K in art. هى;
and so the latter of them is explained in the S,
both there and in the present art.:) and one says,
مَا أَدْرِى أَىُّ هَىِّ بْنِ بَىٍّ هُوَ, meaning I know not
what man he is.. (S.) Accord. to some, (Lth, T,)
هَىُّ بْنُ بَىٍّ was one of the sons of Adam, that
went away in the earth when the rest of his
children dispersed themselves, and no trace of
him was afterwards perceived. (Lth, T, K.)
اِبْنُ بَيَّانَ: see البَىُّ, in two places.
بَيَوِىٌّ rel. n. of بَآءٌ or بَا: whence قَصِيدَةٌ بَيَوِيَّةٌ
[as also بَائِيَّةٌ and بَاوِيَّةٌ] A قصيدة of which the
رَوِىّ is ب. (M in art. ب.)
