And ↓ the latter, [and more commonly the former,]
An intuitive knowledge, notion, or idea; such
as that one is the half of two; being, with respect
to knowledge, like بَدِيعٌ with respect to intellect:
(Kull:) [or] the former signifies the faculty of
judging rightly at the first of an unexpected occurrence: [intuition, or intuitive perception:] accord. to ' Alee-Ibn-Dháfir El-Haddád, it signifies
primarily اِرْتِجَالٌ فِى الكَلَامِ [i. e. the faculty of
extemporizing: or speaking, or composing, extemporaneously, impromptu, without premeditation]: and predominantly, the poetizing, or versifying, impromptu, without premeditation or consideration: except that ارتجال is quicker than
بديهة. (TA.) You say, هُوَ ذُو بَدِيهَةٍ (K) He has
a faculty of judging rightly at the first of an

بَدِيهَةٍ حَسَنَةٍ Such a one has a good faculty of

فِى بَدَائِهِ العُقُولِ [This is known among the intuitive notions of intellects; i. e., intuitively]. (K, *
TA.) بَدَائِهُ seems to be pl. of بَدِيهَةٌ, as in the
phrase, (TA,) لَهُ بَدَائِهُ, i. e. بَدَائِعُ [He has new,
or admirable, things that he utters], (K, TA,) in
speech, or language, and poetry, and in answering, or replying: but here it is not improbable
that the ه may be a substitute for the ع. (TA.)
بَدِيهِىٌّ [Intuitive knowledge;] such that its
origination does not rest upon speculation, and
acquisition by study, whether it do, or do not,
require some other thing, as conjecture or experience &c.; (KT, Kull;) so that it is [sometimes] syn. with ضَرُورِىٌّ [and opposed to نَظَرِىٌّ]:
and sometimes it means such as does not require
anything whatever after the intellect has directed
itself; so that it is more particular than ضَرُورِىٌّ:
(KT:) as the conception of heat and cold, and
the assent of the mind to the position that negation
and affirmation cannot be co-existent, nor be
simultaneously non-existent, in the same instance.
(KT, Kull.) ―
-b2-  [And hence,] A mere simpleton
