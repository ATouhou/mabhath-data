بَلِهَ, (S, Msb, K,) aor.
بَلَهَ, (Msb, K,) inf. n.
بَلَهٌ, (S, * Msb, K, * TA,) [and irregularly بَلَاهَةٌ
and بُلَهْنِيَةٌ, (see بَلَهٌ, below,)] He was, or became,
أَبْلَه [q. v.]; as also ↓ تبلّه; (S, K;) and ↓ ابتله:
(TA:) or he was, or became, weak in intellect.
(Msb.) ―
-b2-  Also He was unable to adduce his
argument, proof, or evidence, (K, TA,) by reason
of his heedlessness, and his smallness, or lack, of
discrimination. (TA.)
3
مُبَالَهَةٌ The showing stupidity [in an action
or in one's actions, i. e. the acting stupidly,] with
any one. (KL.) [You say, بالههُ He acted stupidly,
or in the manner of him who is termed أَبْلَه, with
him.]
4
ابلههُ He found him, or knew him by experience, to be أَبْلَه [q. v.]. (K.)
5
تبلّه: see 1. ―
-b2-  And see 6. ―
-b3-  Also (tropical:)  He
journeyed, or proceeded, or pursued his way,
without any sign of the road, or any track, to
guide him, (Az, K, TA,) without following the
right course, (Az, TA,) and without asking [to be
directed]. (K, TA.) ―
-b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  He prosecuted a
search after a stray, or lost, beast. (JK, K.)
6
تباله He feigned بَلَه, or the attribute denoted
by the term أَبْلَه: (S:) or he made use of that
attribute [as a mask]; i . q. اِسْتَعْمَلَ البَلَهَ; as also
↓ تبلّه. (K.)

إِبْتَلَهَ see 1.
بَلْهَ is an indecl. word with fet-h for its termination, like كَيْفَ, and means دَعْ [Let alone, or
say nothing of]; (S;) [i. e.] it is a noun for دَعْ;
indecl.; (Mughnee, K;) a verbal noun, meaning
دَعْ and أُتْرُكْ; (IAth, TA;) and the noun that
follows it, when it is thus used, is in the accus.
case; (Mughnee, K;) i. e. it is indecl., with
fet-h for its termination, when the noun following
it is in the accus. case; so that you say, بَلْهَ زَيْدًا
[Let alone Zeyd, or say nothing of Zeyd]; like
as you say, رُوَيْدَ زَيْدًا: (IB, TA:) and it is also
an inf. n. in the sense of التَّرْكُ; likewise with
fet-h for its termination, but decl.; and when it
is thus used, the noun that follows it is in
the gen. case; (Mughnee, K;) or it is put
in the place of an inf. n., meaning تَرْكَ [which
is virtually the same as اُتْرُكْ and دَعْ], and is
prefixed to a noun in the gen. case; so that
you say, بَلْهَ زَيْدٍ, i. e. تَرْكَ زَيْدٍ [which is virtually
the same as بَلْهَ زَيْدًا explained above; for تَرْكَ زَيْدٍ
is originally اُتْرُكْ زَيْدًا تَرْكًا, like as فَضَرْبَ الرِّقَابِ
in the Kur xlvii. 4 is originally فاضْرِبُوا الرِّقَابَ
ضَرْبًا]; (IAth, TA;) for in this case it cannot be
regarded as a verbal noun, since verbal nouns
are not prefixed to other nouns, governed by
them in the gen. case: (IB, TA:) and it is also
a noun syn. with كَيْفَ [How?]; likewise with
fet-h for its termination, indecl.; and when it is
thus used, the noun that follows it is in the nom.
case. (Mughnee, K.) A poet says, describing
swords, (S, Mughnee,) namely, Kaab Ibn-Málik,
(S,)
تَذَرُ الجَمَاجِمَ ضَاحِيًا هَامَتُهَا
بَلْهَ الأَكُفَّ كَأَنَّهَا لَمْ تُخْلَقِ
[They leave the skulls with their crowns lying
open to the sun (let alone, or say nothing of, the
hands) as though they had not been created]: (S,
Mughnee:) he says, when they cut, or cut off,
the crowns, then let alone, or say nothing of, the
hands (فَدَعِ الأَكُفَّ): i. e., they are more fit for
cutting off the hands: (TA:) Akh says that بله
is here in the place of an inf. n.; that it is as
when you say, ضَرْبَ زَيْدٍ: but الاكفّ may be in
the accus. case; so that the meaning may be
دَعِ الأَكُفَّ: (S:) the verse is thus recited in two
different ways: and also بَلْهَ الأَكُفُّ [how then
must be the case of the hands?]. (Mughnee.)
And hence the prov., تُحْرِقُكَ النَّارُ إِنْ تَرَاهَا بَلْهَ أَنْ
تَصْلَاهَا, i. e. The fire will burn thee if thou see it
from a distance: then let alone, or say nothing
of, (فَدَعْ,) thy entering into it. (TA.) A strange
instance occurs in the Saheeh of El-Bukháree,
in the explanation of the آلم of the chapter of
السَّجْدَة [the 32nd ch. of the Kur]: he says, God
says [by these three letters], أَعْدَدْتُ لِعِبَادِي
الصَّالِحِينَ مَا لَا عَيْنٌ رَأَتْ وَلَا أُذُنٌ سَمِعَتْ وَ لَا خَطَرِ
عَلَى قَلْبِ بَشَرٍ ذُخْرًا مِنْ بَلْهِ مَا اطَّلَعْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ:
(Mughnee, K: *) or ما أَطَلَعْتُهُمْ عَلَيْهِ: (so in some
copies of the K:) thus بله is used as a decl.
word, governed in the gen. case by من, and
deviating from the three meanings [explained
above]: (Mughnee, K:) but the reading commonly known is, على قلب بشر بَلْهَ مَ أَطْلَعْتُهُمْ عليه;
and this is the reading in the work of J, [the S,]
and in the Nh, and other lexicological works:
(TA:) it has been explained by غَيْر; [so that
the meaning of the sentence as first related above
is, I have prepared for my righteous servants
what eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor hath
it occurred to the mind of man, as a treasure
for the future, (obviously taken from Isaiah
lxiv. 4, quoted by St. Paul in 1 Cor. ii. 9,) save,
or except, that with which ye have become acquainted, or that with which I have acquainted
them; and the same, with the omission of “ as a
treasure for the future, “is the meaning of the
sentence as related in the S and Nh &c.;] (Mughnee, K;) i. e. سِوَى, as in the S; (TA;) and this
corroborates, (Mughnee,) or is agreeable with,
(K,) the opinion of those who reckon بله as an
exceptive word: (Mughnee, K:) and as meaning أَجَلْ [app. a mistranscription for أَجْل; i. e.,
it has been explained also as meaning I have
done all this because of my promise to them;
(مِنْ أَجْلِ مَا أَطْلَعْتُهُمْ عَلَيْهِ because of that with
which I have acquainted them;) and thus it may
have been read by SM, for he has written اجل
without any syll. signs; and has given no other
ex. of بله in the sense here intended except one
commencing with the words, بَلْهَ انِّى لَمْ أَخُنْ
عَهْدًا, which may mean because I have not broken
a covenant, or yea, verily I have not &c., accord.
as we read أَنِّى or إِنِّى]: or as meaning كُفَّ [or
rather كُفَّ عَنْ] and دَعْ [let alone, or say nothing
of; but this explanation must relate to the sentence as given in the S and Nh]: (K, but omitted
in an excellent copy of that work:) or, accord. to
El-Ahmar, it means, in this trad. [as commonly
known], كَيُفَ [how? which seems to be the
least suitable of all these explanations]. (TA.)
IAmb relates, on the authority of others, that بَلْهَ
is also syn. with عَلَى: [but I think that this is a
mistake, arising from a misunderstanding of what
here follows:] Fr says that he who makes it to
govern a gen. case regards it as used in the
manner of عَلَى, and similar particles governing
the gen. case. (TA.) ―
-b2-  مَا بَلْهَكَ means مَا بَالُكَ
[What is thy state, or condition, or case?]: (K,
TA:) or مَا لَكَ [which often has this meaning:
see the letter ل]. (So in some copies of the K.)
بَلَهٌ and ↓ بَلَاهَةٌ [both properly inf. ns.; see 1;]
The attribute, or quality, denoted by the epithet
أَبْلَهٌ [q. v.]; (S, K;) i. e. heedlessness: (K:) or
heedlessness of evil; (JK in explanation of the
former, and K;) &c.; (K;) and ↓ بُلَهْنِيَةٌ signifies
the same; and stupidity and languor. (JK.)
بَلَهَآءُ: see أَبْلَهُ.
بُلَهْنِيَةٌ, (K,) or بَلَهْنِيَةُ العَيْشِ, (JK,) or مِنَ العَيْشِ,
(S,) (tropical:)  An easy and a plentiful, (S, K, TA,) or a
pleasant and heedless, (JK, TA, *) state, or condition, of life: (JK, S, K, TA:) from عَيْشٌ أَبْلَهُ
[q. v.]: (Har p. 216:) the word بلهنية is rendered
quasi-coordinate to the quinqueliteral-radical class
by ا at the end, which is changed into ى because
of the kesreh before it: (S in art. بلهن:) it is
like رُفَغْنِيَةٌ and رُفَهْنِيَةٌ: IB says that it should be
mentioned in art. بله, and means عَيْشٌ أَبْلَهُ; the
ن and ى being augmentative, to render it quasicoordinate to خُبَعْثِنَةٌ: it is mentioned in the K
[and S] in arts. بلهن and بله: (TA in art.
بلهن:) the ن is augmentative accord. to Sb. (S in
the present art.) One says, لَا زِلْتَ مُلَقًّى بِتَهْنِئَةٍ
مُبَقًّى فِىبُلَهْنِيَةٍ (tropical:)  [Mayest thou not cease to be
greeted with congratulation, and made to continue
in an easy and a plentiful state of life]. (A, K.)
―
-b2-  See also بَلَهٌ.
بَلَاهَةٌ: see بَلَهٌ.
أَبْلَهُ Heedless: (K:) or heedless of evil (K,
TA) by reason of his goodness: (TA:) or simple,
foolish, or of little sense, without discrimination:
(K:) or weak in intellect: (Msb:) accord. to
En-Nadr, (TA,) one whose evilness is dead, (K,
TA,) so that he is not cognizant of it: (TA:)
good in disposition; having little cognizance, or
understanding, of subtilties; or having little skill
therein: (K:) or one whose predominant quality
is freedom of the bosom, or heart, or mind, from
evil affections; (S, K, TA;) and good opinion of
men: (TA:) simple-hearted: (TK:) naturally
disposed to goodness, and therefore heedless of
evil, not knowing it: (T, TA:) or heedless with
respect to the present world and its people and
their corruptness and malevolence, but intelligent
and skilled in the law with respect to that which
is commanded and that which is forbidden: (Ah-
mad Ibn-Hambal, TA:) fem. بَلْهَآءُ: (S, Msb,
K: *) pl. بُلْهٌ: (S, Msb:) and ↓ بُلَهَآءُ, a pl., [as
though the sing. were بَلِيهٌ,] signifies dull, stupid,
or wanting in intelligence: but this is post-classical.
(TA.) Hence, شَابٌّ أَبْلَهُ [A youth, or young man,
who is heedless, &c.], because of his inexperience
in affairs: the epithet is applied to a youth in like
manner as freedom from care, or thought, and
like as insanity, are attributed to him. (S.) And
خَيْرُ أَوْلَادِنَا الأَبْلَهُ العَقُولُ (tropical:)  [The best of our children
is the heedless, &c., that has much intelligence];
(S, Msb;) a saying of Ez-Zibrikán Ibn-Bedr;
(S;) meaning such as, by reason of his bashfulness, is like the ابله, (S, Msb,) so that he feigns
heedlessness, and passes over things, (Msb,) though
he has much intelligence; (S;) or such as is
thought to be stupid, but, when examined, is
found to be [very] intelligent. (IAth, TA in art.
عقل.) And أَكْثَرُ أَهْلِ الجَنَّةِ البُلْهُ, a trad., meaning Most of the people of Paradise are the بُلْه
[or heedless, &c.,] with respect to the present
world, because of their being little concerned
thereby, while they are intelligent with respect to
the world to come; (S;) or they are thus termed
because they are heedless of their affairs in the
present world, and unskilful in the management
thereof, and busy themselves with their affairs
relating to the world to come. (TA.) ―
-b2-  بَلْهَآءُ,
applied to a woman, Generous, strong-hearted,
(مَزِيرَةٌ, for المَرِيرَةُ in the copies of the K is a
mistake for المَزِيرَةُ, with زاى, TA, [app. here
meaning bold,]) inexperienced in affairs, and
simple, or unintelligent. (K, * TA.) ISh cites a
poet as applying this epithet to a young girl with
whom he had sported, and who acquainted him
with her secrets, by reason of her inexperience,
and want of cunning, not knowing what that
implied against her. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Also, applied to a
she-camel, (tropical:)  That does not take fright, and flee
from a thing, (ISh, A, K,) by reason of staidness,
(ISh, K,) or heaviness, (A,) as though she were
stupid. (ISh, A, K.) One does not say جَمَلٌ أَبْلَهُ.
(ISh, TA.) ―
-b4-  شَبَابٌ أَبْلَهُ (tropical:)  Soft, or delicate, youth;
(T, A, K;) as though he who enjoys it were
heedless of nocturnal accidents or calamities. (A,
K.) ―
-b5-  And عَيْشٌ أَبْلَهُ (tropical:)  A soft, or delicate, or
pleasant, or plentiful and easy, life: (K, TA:)
or a life in which are few anxieties: (CK:) or a
life in which are few griefs, or sorrows. (S.)
[See also بُلَهْنِيَةٌ.]
