بيد1
بَادَ, aor. يَبِيدُ, inf. n. بَيْدٌ (T, S, M, &c.)
and بُيُودٌ (S, M, L, Msb, K) and بَيَادٌ (M, L, Msb,
K) and بَيْدُودَةٌ (Lh, M, L, K) and بَوَادٌ (L, K)
and بَوْدٌ, (CK,) the last but one disapproved
by MF, (TA,) [and the last equally doubtful,]
He, or it, perished; (T, S, A, Mgh, L, Msb;)
went away; passed away; became cut off, or
extinct; came to an end. (M, L, K.) ―
-b2-  بَادَتِ
الشَّمْسُ, inf. n. بُيُودٌ, The sun set. (Sb, M, K.)
4
أَبَادَهُمْ He (God) destroyed them; (T, S, A,
Mgh, * Msb;) caused them to go away, pass away,
become cut off or extinct, or come to an end.
(M. *)
بَيْدَ, (T, S, M, L, Mughnee, K,) as also ↓ بَايَدَ,
(L, K,) or بَائِدَ, (so in the Mughnee and in a
MS. copy of the K and in the CK, and in a MS.
copy of the K omitted,) a noun inseparably prefixed to أَنَّ with its complement, (Mughnee,) used
as syn. with غَيْر, (Ks, T, S, M, &c.,) but never otherwise than in the accus. case, nor as an epithet, nor
otherwise than as an exceptive in a case in which
the thing excepted is disunited in kind from that
from which the exception is made. (Mughnee.)
You say, هُوَ كَثِيرُ المَالِ بَيْدَ أَنَّهُ بَخِيلٌ He is
possessed of abundant, or much, wealth, but he is
niggardly. (ISk, S, M, A, Msb, Mughnee.) ―
-b2-
Also as syn. with عَلَى, (M, K,) as some say;
(A'Obeyd, M;) but to render it in the former
manner is preferable. (M.) Accord. to some,
(L,) it is syn. with عَلَى in the following trad.:
نَحْنُ الآخِرُونَ السَّابِقُونَ يَوْمَ القيَامَةِ بَيْدَ أَنَّهُمْ أُوتُو
الكِتَابَ مِنْ قَبْلِنَا وَ أُوتِينَاهُ مِنْ بَعْدِهِمْ [We, the
latter people, shall be those who will precede on
the day of resurrection, although they were given
the Scripture before us, and we were given it
after them]: (T, L:) El-Umawee holds it to be
so: (T:) but Ks says that it here signifies غَيْر
[as in the former ex.]: (T, L: [and so says IHsh
in the Mughnee:]) accord. to one recital, it is
بايَد; (L;) or بَائِدَ; so in the Musnad of the
Imám Esh-Sháfi'ee: (Mughnee:) IAth says, I
have not found this in the classical language in
the sense of عَلَى: some say that it is بِأَيْدٍ, i. e.
by means of strength, or power; and that the
meaning is, we shall be those who will precede
to Paradise on the day of resurrection by means
of strength, or power, given us by God. (L.) ―
-b3-
Also, [accord. to some,] as meaning مِنْ أَجْلِ:
(L, Mughnee, K:) as in the saying of Mohammad, أَنَا أَفْصَحُ العَرَبِ بَيْدَ أَنِّى مِنْ قُرَيْشٍ وَنَشَأْتُ
فِى بَنِى سَعْدٍ [I am the most chaste in speech of
the Arabs because I am of the tribe of Kureysh
and I grew up among the children of Saad]:
(T, L: [in the Mughnee given somewhat differently:]) but Ibn-Málik and others say that it
here, also, means غير, after the manner in which
the latter is used in the saying [of a poet],
وَلَا عَيْبَ فِيهِمْ غَيْرَ أَنَّ سُيُوفَهُمْ
بِهِنَّ فُلُولٌ مِنْ قِرَاعِ الكَتَائِبِ
[And there is no blemish in them, save that their
swords have in them notches from the conflicting
of the troops]. (Mughnee.) This manner of
praising is termed by Abu-l-'Abbás Mohammad
Ibn-Yezeed اِسْتِثْبَاتٌ. (Ham p. 474.) ―
-b4-  مَيْدَ is
also a dial. var. of the same. (A'Obeyd, T,
Mughnee.)
بَيْدَآءُ A desert; or a waterless desert: (S, M, A,
Mgh, Msb, K:) or one that is plain, or level, in
which horses are made to run: (M:) or one
wherein is nothing: (TA:) so called, accord. to
IJ, because it [often] destroys him who alights,
or sojourns, in it: (M, Msb: *) or a plain tract,
slightly elevated, with few trees, and without
herbage, extending to the distance of a day's
journey, or half a day's journey, or less, rugged
and hard, and only in a country of mould, or
clay: (ISh:) pl. بِيْدٌ: (S, M, Msb, K:) it has a
pl. of a form proper to epithets because it is originally an epithet: (M:) by rule it should be
بَيْدَاوَاتٌ. (M, K.)
بَيْدَانَةٌ A she-ass; a subst. applied to that
animal: (S:) or a wild she-ass: (M, K:) or one
that inhabits a desert (بَيْدَآء); (T, K;) [an epithet;] not a subst. applied to the animal; J being
in error in asserting it to be such: (K:) the
[wild] she-ass is thus called, accord. to most of
the lexicologists, because it inhabits the بيداء;
and if so, the ن is an augmentative letter: or,
accord. to some, because it is large in the body
(البَدَن); and if so, the ن is a radical letter:
(L:) the pl. is بَيْدَانَاتٌ. (L, K.)
بَايَدَ, or بَائِدَ: see بَيْدَ.
Quasi بير
بِيْرٌ; pl. of pauc. أَبْيَارٌ: see بِئْرٌ, in art. بأر.
