بطقبِطَاقَةٌ A piece of paper: (IAar, M, Sgh, TA:)
in the K, الحَدَقَةُ is erroneously put for الوَرَقَةُ:
(TA:) a ticket that is attached to a garment, or
piece of cloth, (T, S, M, L, K,) bearing the mark,
or inscription, of its price; (T, S, L, K;) or a
ticket marked, or inscribed, with the weight, and
the number, of a thing: (TA:) of the dial. of
Egypt (T, S, L) and the neighbouring parts: (T,
L:) so called, (K,) or said (by Sh, TA) to be so
called, (S,) because it is tied by a twist, or thread,
(بِطَاقَةً,) of the unwoven end of the cloth: (S, K:)
but this is a mistake: (ISd, TA:) [in Greek,
πιττά� degreesιον, as observed by Freytag; and hence
probably derived:] accord. to some, it is [نِطَاقَةً,]
with ن, because it tells (تَنْطِقُ) what is marked,
or inscribed, thereon; but this is strange. (TA.)
It is said in a trad., that a man will be brought
on the day of resurrection, and ninety-nine scrolls,
or records, inscribed with his sins will be produced; and there will be produced for him a بطاقة
bearing the testimony that there is no deity but
God, and it will outweigh the others. (TA.)
