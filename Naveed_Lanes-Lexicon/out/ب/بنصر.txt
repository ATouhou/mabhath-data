بنصربِنْصِرٌ The finger that is next to the little finger;
(S in art. بصر;) [the third finger;] that which is
between the little and middle fingers: (Msb in
art. بصر, and K:) of the fem. gender: (K:) pl.
بَنَاصِرُ, (S,) or بَنَاصِرَةٌ. (Msb.) Accord. to the
author of the K, the ن is a radical letter, and
therefore the mention of this word in art. بصر is
wrong. (TA.)
