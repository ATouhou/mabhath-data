قَدْ بَلَّعَتْ بِى ذُرْأَةٌ فَأَلْحَفَتْ
[Hoariness, or grayness, or the like, had begun
to appear, &c., upon me, and marred me]; making the verb trans. by بِ because it has the
meaning of قَدْ آلَمَتْ [it had given pain, and this
verb is thus made trans.]; or substituting بِى for
فِىَّ on account of the measure, which would not
be right if he said فِىَّ. (TA.) You say also,
فِيهِ الشَّيْبُ ↓ تبلّع Hoariness appeared upon him.

Q. Q. 1
بَلْعَمَ: see 1, in two places. [The م in
this word is generally held to be augmentative:
see بَلْعَمٌ.]
بُلَعٌ, applied to a man, Voracious; a great
eater; as also ↓ بُلَعَةٌ and ↓ مِبْلَعٌ (K) and ↓ بَوْلَعٌ:
(IAar, K:) [↓ بَلَّاعْ signifies the same:] and ↓ هِبْلَعٌ,
(S and K in art. هبلع,) in which the ه is said by
some to be augmentative, (TA,) and ↓ هَبَلَّعٌ (Lth,
K) and ↓ هِبْلَاعٌ, (IDrd, K,) also signify the same;
(S in art. هبلع;) or voracious, or a great eater,
who takes large mouthfuls, and is wide in the
حُنْجُور [app. here meaning the fauces]: (Lth,
and K in art. مبلع:) and ↓ بُلَعَةٌ, applied to a
woman, one who swallows everything. (Fr.) ↓ يَا بَلَّاعَ
الأَيْرِ [app. meaning يَا مَأْبُونُ] is an expression of
vituperation used by the people of Syria. (TA.)
―
-b2-  سَعْدُ بُلَعَ, (Lth, S, K,) determinate, (Lth, K,)
[the latter word imperfectly decl.,] One of the
Mansions of the Moon; (S, K;) [namely, the
Twenty-third;] which rose [aurorally], (S, K,)
as they assert, (S,) when God said, يَا أَرْضُ ابْلضعِى
مَآءَكِ [Kur xi. 46]; (S, K;) consisting of two
stars near together; (S;) or two stars, straight
(مُسْتَوِيَانِ) in course, (IKt, K,) or near together
and oblique; (TA;) one of them dim, and the
other bright, and called ↓ بَالِعٌ, as though it swallowed the former, (IKt, K, TA,) namely, the dim
one, and took its light: (TA:) it rises [aurorally]
in the last night but one [lit. one night remaining] of كَانُون الآخِر [Jan., O. S.], and sets
[aurorally] when one night has passed of آب
[Aug., O. S.]. (IKt, K.) [Accord. to my calculation, it thus rose in Arabia about the commencement of the era of the Flight, on the 29th
of Jan., O. S., and set aurorally on the 30th of
July. See مَنَازِلِ القَمَرِ, in art. نزل: and see also
سَعْدٌ.] The rhyming-proser of the Arabs says,
إِذَا طَلَعَ سَعْدُ بُلَعْ اِقْتَحَمَ الرُّبَعْ وَ لَحِقَ الهُبَعْ وَصِيَدَ
المُرَعْ وَصَارَ فِى الأَرْضِ لُمَعْ [When Saad-Bula'
rises aurorally,] the رُبَع [or young camel brought
forth in the season called رَبِيع, which is the
beginning of the breeding-time,] becomes strong
in his walk, and quick, but not strong to labour,
and the هُبَع [or young camel brought forth
in the end of the breeding-time] acquires some
strength, and attains to him, and the مُرَع, a kind
of bird, is then, it seems, caught, or snared, [and
parts differing in colour from the rest become
apparent in the earth.] (TA.)

n. un. with ة: (K:) or the hole, or perforation,
in the قَامَة of the بَكْرَة [which here means the
pulley, or sheave with its apparatus]: (S:) or
↓ بُلَعَةُ has this latter signification; and بُلَعٌ is its
pl.; [or is a coll. gen. n.;] so explained by Az;
and this is the correct explanation. (Marginal
note in a copy of the S.)
بُلْعَةٌ A gulp, or as much as one swallows at
once, of beverage; like جُرْعَةٌ. (TA.)
بُلَعَةٌ, as an epithet: see بُلَعٌ, in two places:
