برجمبُرْجُمَةٌ (in the Ham p. 352 بُرْجُمٌ) is the sing.
of بَرَاجِمُ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and بُرْجُمَاتٌ; (T,
TA;) and signifies [A knuckle, or finger-joint;]
the outer, or the inner, joint, or place of division,
of the fingers: and (as some say, TA) the middle
toe of any bird: (K:) or بَرَاجِمُ signifies all the
finger-joints; (A'Obeyd, K;) as also رَوَاجِمُ [a
mistranscription for رَوَاجِب]: (A'Obeyd, TA:)
or the parts of the fingers that are protuberant
when one clinches his hand: (Ham ubi suprà:)
or the backs of the finger-bones: (K:) or the
finger-joints (S, Mgh) that are between the أَشَاجِع
and the رَوَاجِب; (S;) i. e. (S, Mgh) [the middle
knuckles; (see أَشْجَعُ and رَاجِبَةٌ;)] the heads of
the سُلَامَيَات, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) on the back, or
outer side, of the hand, (S, Msb,) which become
protuberant when one clinches his hand: (S, Mgh,
Msb, K:) or, as in the Kf, the heads of the
سلاميات; and their inner and outer sides are
termed the رَوَاجِب: (Msb:) accord. to the T,
the wrinkled parts at the joints of the fingers;
the smooth portion between which is called رَاجِبَةٌ:
or, as in another place, in the backs of the fingers;
the parts between them being called the رَوَاجِب:
in every finger are three بُرْجُمَات, except the
thumb: or, as in another place, in every finger
are two of what are thus termed: it is also explained as signifying the joints in the backs of
the fingers, upon which the dirt collects. (TA.)
The phrase الأَخْذُ بِالبَرَاجِمِ, meaning The seizing
with the hand, is one requiring consideration [as
of doubtful character]. (Mgh.) [See also بُرْثُنٌ.]
