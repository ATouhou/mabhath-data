بَرَوْتُهَا, i. e. النَّاقَةَ: see 4.
-A2-  بَرَوْتُهُ, (M,
Msb, K,) aor.
بَرُوَ, (Lth, T,) inf. n. بَرْوٌ, (M,) I
formed it, or fashioned it, by cutting; shaped
it out; or pared it; (K;) namely, a reed for
writing, (Lth, T, M, Msb, K,) and a stick, or
piece of wood, (M, K,) and an arrow, (K,)
[&c.;] a dial. var. of بَرَيْتُهُ, (Lth, T, M, Msb,)
used by some, (Lth, T,) but the latter is the more
approved: (M, TA:) mentioned by AZ. (TA.)
―
-b2-  [Hence, perhaps,] بَرَاهُ, aor.
بَرُوَ, inf. n. بَرْوٌ, He
(i. e. God) created him, or it: (Fr, S, K:) [but]
they affirm that it is originally بَرَأَهُ, with hemz:
(MF:) so says IAth: (TA:) or it is from بَرًا
or بَرًى, signifying “dust,” or “earth.” (Fr, S.)
-A3-  بَرَا, aor.
بَرُوَ, is also a bad dial. var. of بَرَأَ [signifying He, or it, recovered from disease, or
became convalescent, &c.], aor. يَبْرُؤُ. (TA.)

أَبْرَيْتُهَا, (S, M, K,) i. e. النَّاقَةَ, (S, M,) I put
a [ring such as is termed] بُرَة in her (a camel's)
nose; (S, M, K;) as also ↓ بَرَوْتُهَا: (IJ, M, K:)
and ابريتهُ, namely, a camel, I put him a بُرَة.
(Msb.)
-A2-  ابرى Dust, or earth, came, or lighted,
upon it. (K,* TA, in art. برى.)
بُرَةٌ (in which the final radical letter is elided,
[and replaced by ة,] Msb) A ring (T, S, M, &c.)
of brass, (Lth, Lh, T, S, M, [in a copy of the
Msb, من صوف is erroneously put for مِنْ صُفْرٍ,])
or of silver, (Lth, T,) or of some other material,
(Lh, M,) slender, and bent at the two ends [lest
it should open at the place where the two ends
meet], that is put in the nose of a she-camel,
(Lth, T,) or put in the nose of the camel, (M,
Msb, K,) or in the flesh of the nose of the camel,
(Lh, S, M, K,) or, as As says, in one of the two
sides of the two nostrils, (S,) app. either for the
purpose of ornament or to render the animal
obedient; (MF;) [generally for the latter purpose, to attach the rein thereto:] when the ring
is of hair, it is termed خِزَامَةٌ; (As, S, Msb;)
and when of wood, خِشَاشٌ: (Msb:) Aboo-' Alee
mentions, and explains in like manner, ↓ بَرْوَةٌ
and بُرًى; [the latter as pl. of the former;] but
this is extr.: (M:) J says, [in the S,] Aboo-
'Alee says that بُرَةٌ is originally بَرْوَةٌ, because it
has بُرًى for a pl., like as قَرْيَة has قُرًى; but
Aboo-' Alee does not say this; he only desires
to show that the final radical letter of بُرَةٌ is و
by the fact that بَرْوَةٌ is a dial. var. thereof: (IB,
TA:) some, however, remarking upon J's saying
that the original of بَرَةٌ is بَرْوَةٌ, assert that it is
correctly ↓ بُرْوَةٌ: (TA:) بُرَةٌ also signifies an
anklet: (M, K:) or any ring; such as a bracelet
and an earring and an anklet and the like of
these: (S:) the pl. (in the former and the latter
senses, M, TA) is بُرَاتٌ, (S, M, K,) in [some of]
the copies of the K erroneously written بُرَاةٌ, (TA,)
and بُرًى, (T, S, M,) and بُرُونَ, contr. to analogy,
(Msb,) or بُرِينَ (T, S, M, K, [in all of which,
except the last, this is in the accus. or the gen.
case, but, as it is the nom. case in the K, it may
be that بُرُونَ and بُرِينَ are dial. vars., like سِنُونَ
and سِنِينَ,]) and بُرِينَ. (M, K: [in a copy of the
former of which, accord. to the TT, بُرِىٌّ and بِرِىٌّ
are put in the place of the last two of these pls.])
بَرًا, or بَرًى, Dust, or earth: (Fr, S, M, Msb,
K, mentioned in the M and K in art. برى:)
whence بَرَاهُ, [if not originally بَرَأَهُ,] meaning “He
(i. e. God) created him.” (Fr, S.) Hence the
saying, بِفِيهِ البَرَا, or البَرَى, [In his mouth be
dust, or earth], (S, M,) a form of imprecation
against a man. (M.)
بَرْوَةٌ Cuttings, chips, parings, or the like, of a
reed for writing, and of a stick, or piece of wood,
and of soap, and the like. (TA.)
-A2-  See also بُرَةٌ.
بُرْوَةٌ: see بُرَةٌ.
البَرِيَّةٌ The creation; as meaning the beings,
or things, that are created; or, particularly,
mankind; syn. الخَلْقُ: originally with ء: (S:)
but not pronounced with ء: (IAth, TA in art.
برى:) or, accord. to Fr, if from بَرًا, or بَرًى, i. e.
“dust,” or “earth,” it is originally without ء:
pl. بَرَايَا and بَرِيَّاتٌ. (S.)
مُبْرَاةٌ A she-camel (T, S) having a [ring such
as is termed] بُرَة put in her nose: (T, S, K:)
pl. مُبْرَيَاتٌ. (TA in art. عرف.)
بُرَةٌ مَبْرُوَّةٌ (T, M, K) A بُرَة made, or manufactured. (T, TA.)
