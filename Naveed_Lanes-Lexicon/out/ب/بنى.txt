بنى1
بَنَاهُ, (T, S, M, &c.,) aor.
بَنِىَ, (M, Msb,) and
بَنُىَ,
but the former is the more common, (M,) [or
rather the only form commonly known,] inf. n.
بِنَآءٌ (T, S, M, Mgh, K) and بِنًا (T, and TA as
from the M [but it is not in the transcript of the
M in the TT]) and بَنْىٌ and بُنْيَانٌ and بِنْيَةٌ and
بنَايَةٌ, (M, K,) He built it; framed it; constructed
it; contr. of هَدَمَهُ; (M, K;) namely, a house,
(S, Mgh, Msb,) or tent, (S, * Msb,) &c.; (Msb;)
as also ↓ ابتناه, (S, M, Msb, K,) and ↓ بنّاهُ; (M,
K;) or the last has teshdeed given to it to denote
muchness, or frequency, or repetition, of the
action, or its application to many objects; and
hence you say, بنّى قُصُورًا [He built palaces, or
pavilions: or he raised them high: see the pass.
part. n. below]. (S, TA.) AHn speaks of a kind
of plank as being used فِى بِنَآءِ السُّفُنِ [in the construction of ships]: but بِنَآءٌ is originally used
only in relation to that which does not grow; as
stone, and clay, and the like. (M.) You say
also, بَنَى أَرْضًا, for بَنَى فِى أَرْضٍ [He built in, or
upon, land]. (Mgh.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] بَنَى عَلَى أَهْلِهِ,
(T, S, M, Msb, K,) or عَلَى امْرَأَتِهِ, (Mgh,) and
بَنَى بِهَا also, (M, Mgh, Msb, K,) accord. to IDrd
(Mgh, Msb) and IJ, (M,) and occurring in traditions and elsewhere, though said in the S to be
vulgar, (IAth, MF,) and said to be so by ISk,
(T, Msb,) and by some said to be not allowable,
(M,) but the former is the more chaste, (Msb,)
inf. n. بِنَآءٌ; (S, TA;) as also ↓ ابتنى, (K,) i. e.
ابتنى عليها, (ISk, Msb,) or ابتنى بِهَا, (IJ, M,)
He had his wife conducted to him on the occasion
of the marriage: (ISk, T, S, Msb, K:) or he
went in to his wife [for the first time]: (Mgh,
Msb:) originating from the fact that the bridegroom used, on that occasion, to pitch a tent for
her, (ISk, T, S, Mgh, Msb,) a new tent, (Mgh,
Msb,) and furnish it with what was requisite,
(Msb,) or a new tent was set up for him, (Mgh,
Msb,) in honour of him. (Msb.) [See also بَيْتٌ.]
―
-b3-  بِنَايَةٌ is sometimes used in relation to nobility:
(M, K:) and the verb thus used is بَنَى, as above,
(T, M,) having [also] بِنًى for its inf. n., (IAar,
T,) and بِنَآءٌ; held by many to be tropical, but by
some to be proper. (MF.) Lebeed says,
فَسَمَا إِلَيْهِ كَهْلُهَا وَ غُلَامُهَا  فَبَنَى لَنَا رَفِيعًا سَمْكُهُ
(M) And He (namely, God,) hath built for us a
house of nobility of lofty pitch, and its (the
tribe's) middle-aged and its youth have risen to
it: i. e., all of them have attained to high degrees.
(EM, p. 180.) ―
-b4-  بَنَى بَدَنَهُ It (food) fattened
his body, (K,) and made it large: (TA:) and
بَنَى لَحْمَهُ, (T, M, K,) aor.
بَنِىَ, (TA,) inf. n. بِنَآءٌ,
(M,) or بَنْىٌ, (TA,) It (food) made his flesh to
grow, (T, M, K,) and to become large. (T, TA.)
―
-b5-  بَنَى الرَّجُلَ He reared, brought up, or educated,
the man; (M, K;) as also ↓ ابتناهُ. (M.) ―
-b6-  [بَنَى
كَلِمَةً, inf. n. بِنَآءٌ, He formed a word. ―
-b7-  And
He made a word indeclinable, so as to end invariably with a quiescent letter or with a particular
vowel.] بِنَآءُ كَلِمَةٍ [when the former word is considered as the inf. n. of the pass. form بُنِىَ, generally] signifies A word's keeping always the same
mode of termination, ending with a quiescent
letter or with a particular vowel, not by reason
of any governing word: (M, K:) as though the
word resembled a fixed, immoveable building.
(M.) [You say, بُنِيَتْ عَلَى السُّكُونِ It was made
indeclinable, with a quiescent letter for its termination; and عَلَى الفَتْحِ with fet-h for its termination; &c. ―
-b8-  And in like manner you say, بَنَى
القَصِيدَةَ عَلَى البَآءِ, &c., He made the قصيدة to
have ب, &c., for its rhyme-letter, or its chief
rhyme-letter.]
-A2-  بَنَتِ القَوْسُ عَلَى وَتَرِهَا The bow
clave to its string (T, S, K) so that it (the latter)

ابناهُ He made him to build, frame, or construct, a house, or tent: (S:) or he gave him a
building: or he gave him that wherewith to build
a house: (M, K:) and ابناهُ بَيْتًا he gave him a
house, or tent, to build or frame or construct.
(T.) It is said in a prov., المِعْزَي تُبْهِى وَلَا تُبْنِى
[Goats rend, or make holes, and render vacant,
and do not afford materials for fabricating tents];
i. e., they do not yield hair of which a tent is
fabricated; (T, S; *) for the tents of the Arabs
[of the desert] are of the kind called طِرَاف, made
of skin, and أَخْبِيَة, made of wool or of camels' fur,
and not of شَعَر [by which is especially meant goats'
hair], (S,) or, as is found in the handwriting of
Aboo-Sahl, of wool or of skin: (TA:) or the
meaning is, goats rend tents, or pierce them with
holes, by their leaping upon them, (T and S in
art. بهو,) so that they cannot be inhabited, (S in
that art.,) and do not aid in the fabrication of
tents; for the goats of the Arabs of the desert
have short hair, not long enough to be spun;
whereas the goats of the cold countries, and of the
people of the fertile regions, have abundant hair,
and of this the Akrád [or Kurdees] fabricate their
tents. (T.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] He introduced him to
his wife [on the occasion of his marriage]: whence
the saying of 'Alee, مَتَى تُبْنيِنِى, accord. to IAth
properly meaning مَتَى تَجْعَلُنِى أَبْنِى بِزَوْجَتِى
[When wilt thou make me to have my wife conducted to me? or, to go in to my wife?]. (TA.)
5
تَبَنَّتْ, said of a woman sitting, (T, TA,) She
became like a tent (T, IAth, K, * TA) of the kind
called مِبْنَاةٌ, (T, TA,) i. e., a قُبَّة of skin; by reason
of her fatness, (T, IAth, TA,) and largeness, (T,
TA,) or fleshiness: (IAth, TA:) or she parted
her legs; as though from مِبْنَاة, i. e. a قُبَّة of skin,
which, when pitched, is spread out by the ropes:
so this woman, sitting cross-legged, spread apart
her legs. (T, TA.) And تبنّى, said of a camel's
hump, It became fat. (M.)
-A2-  تبنّاهُ He adopted
him as a son: (S, K:) or he asserted him to be,
or claimed him as, a son: (M:) and تبنّى بِهِ
signifies the same. (Zj, TA.)

places.
بُنًى: see بِنَآءٌ.
بِنًى: see بِنَآءٌ.
بَنَاةُ اللَّحْمِ, (IB, TA,) the former of which words
is incorrectly written in the K بنات, (TA,) A girl
whose flesh has been made to grow and become
large: (IB, K, TA: [in the CK, مَبْنِيَّةٌ is erroneously put for مَبْنِيَّتُهُ:]) or, accord. to a learned
scholiast, this is a mistake of IB, and the meaning
is sweet in odour; i. e. sweet in the odour of the
flesh. (TA.)
بَنَاتٌ: pl. of بِنْتٌ; and sometimes of اِبْنٌ: see اِبْنٌ.
بَنُونَ: pl. of اِبْنٌ, which see below.
بُنْيَةٌ: see بِنَآءٌ.
بِنْيَةٌ A form, mode, or manner, of building or
framing or construction; a word like مِشْيَةٌُ and
رِكْبَةٌ. (T, TA.) [The form, or mode of formation, of a word.] Natural constitution: as in
the phrase, فُلَانٌ صَحِيحُ البِنْيَةِ [Such a one is
sound in natural constitution]. (S.) ―
-b2-  See also
بِنَآءٌ.
بِنْتِىٌّ: see what next follows.
بَنَوِىٌّ Of, or relating to, a son; rel. n. of اِبْنٌ;
as also ↓ اِبْنِىٌّ [with ا when connected with a preceding word]: (S, Msb:) the latter is allowable,
(Msb,) and used by some. (S.) And Of, or
relating to, a daughter; rel. n. of بِنْتٌ; as also
↓ بِنْتِىٌّ: (S, M, Msb, K:) the latter accord. to
Yoo; (S, M;) but rejected by Sb. (TA.) ―
-b2-
Also Of, or relating to, what are termed بُنَيَّاتُ
الطَّرِيقِ, i. e., the small roads that branch off from
the main road. (S.)
بُنْيَانٌ and بُنْيَانَةٌ: see what next follows.
بِنَآءٌ [originally an inf. n.: (see 1, first sentence:)
then applied to A building; a structure; an edifice;] a thing that is built, or constructed; pl.
أَبْنِيَةٌ, and pl. pl. أَبْنِيَاتٌ: (M, K:) and ↓ بُنْيَانٌ
[also] has this meaning; (Msb;) [and is likewise
originally an inf. n.;] or this signifies a wall;
syn. حَائِطٌ; (S;) or it may be a pl., [or rather a
coll. gen. n., meaning buildings, structures, edifices,
or walls,] of which the sing. [or n. un.] is ↓ بُنْيَانَةٌ,
and as such may be masc. and fem: (Er-Rághib,
TA:) ↓ بِنْيَةٌ and ↓ بُنْيَةٌ also signify [the same as
بِنَآءٌ as explained above; or] a thing that one has
built, framed, or constructed; (M, K;) or, accord.
to some, the former of these two relates to objects
of the senses, and the latter to objects of the mind,
to glory or honour or the like; (MF, TA;) and
their pls. are ↓ بِنًى and ↓ بُنًى; (K;) or, accord.
to the S and M, these two appear to be sings.;
(TA;) [or they may be pls. or sings.; for J says
that] البُنَى is like البِنَى; one says, بُنْيَةٌ and بُنًى,
and بِنْيَةٌ and بِنًى; (S;) [and ISd says that] بِنْيَةٌ
and بُنْيَةٌ signify as above, and so بِنًى and بُنًى;
or, accord. to Aboo-Is-hák, بِنًى is pl. of بِنْيَةٌ; or
it may be used by poetic licence for بِنَآءٌ: (M:)
accord. to IAar, بِنًى signifies buildings, or structures, of clay: and also [tents] of wool; (T;)
and بِنَآءٌ likewise signifies a tent (M, TA) in which
the Arabs of the desert dwell, in the desert, (TA,)
such as is called خِبَآء; (M, TA; *) and طِرَافٌ and
قُبَّةٌ and مِضْرَبٌ are names applied to dwellings of
the same kind; (TA;) pl. أَبْنِيَةٌ: (M:) the moveable dwelling, such as the خَيْمَة and مِظَلَّة and
فُسْطَاط and سُرَادِق and the like, is called بِنَآءٌ as
being likened to the building of burnt bricks and
of clay and of gypsum. (M.) [See also بَنِيَّةٌ.]
―
-b2-  Also The roof, or ceiling, of a house or
chamber or the like; as in the Kur [ii. 20],
الَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الأَرْضَ فِراشًا وَ السَّمَآءَ بِنَآءً [Who hath
made for you the earth as a bed, and the heaven
as a roof, or ceiling]: (S, [but wanting in some
copies,] and Jel:) so says AZ: (S:) or the
meaning here is, as a tent (قُبَّة) pitched over you.
(Bd.) ―
-b3-  And The body, with the limbs or members. (TA.) ―
-b4-  And i. q. نِطْعٌ [A thing that is
spread on the ground to serve as a table for food
&c., made of leather; like مِبْنَاةٌ]: occurring in a
trad., where it is mentioned as spread on the
ground, on a day of rain, for Mohammad to pray
upon: so says Sh. (T.)
بُنَىٌّ, [said to be] originally بُنَيْوٌ, A little son;
[used as a term of endearment;] (Msb;) dim. of
اِبْنٌ. (S, Mgh, Msb.) You say, يَا بُنَىِّ and يَا بُنَىَّ
[O my little son, or O my child], with kesr to the
ى and with fet-h also; like as you say, يَا أَبَتِ
and يَا أَبَتَ [which see in art. ابو, voce أَبٌ]. (Fr,
S, K.) [The fem. is بُنَيَّةٌ A little daughter; dim.
of بِنْتٌ. And hence,] ―
-b2-  بُنَيَّاتُ الطَّرِيقَ The small
roads that branch off from the main road; (S;)
what are termed التُّرَّهَاتُ. (S, K.) ―
-b3-  The Arabs
say, الرِّفْقُ بُنَىُّ الحِلْمِ, meaning الرفق is like الحلم.
(IAar, ISd.)
بُنُوَّةٌ Sonship: (Lth, Zj, S, M, Msb, K:) [it may
be originally بُنُويَةٌ, for Az says, app. on the authority of Zj,] it is not a decisive proof that the last
radical is و, since they say فُتُوَّةٌ, though the dual
[of the word from which this is derived] is فَتَيَانِ;
(T;) [and ISd says that] بُنُوَّةٌ is thus because of
the dammeh. (M.)
البَنِيَّةُ [properly The building, like البِنَآءُ &c.: but
particularly applied to] the Kaabeh; (S, M, K;)
because of its nobleness. (M, K.) One says,
لَا وَرَبِّ هٰذِهِ البَنِيَّةِ مَا كَانَ كَذَا وَكَذَا [No, by the
Lord of this building (the Kaabeh), such and such
thing were not]: (S, TA:) and this was a common form of oath. (TA.) The Kaabeh is also
called بَنِيَّةُ إِبْرَاهِيمَ [The building of Abraham];
because he built it. (TA.)
بَنَّآءٌ A builder; [meaning one whose business is
that of building;] an architect. (M.) [See also
what next follows.]
بَانٍ [Building, framing, or constructing]:
accord. to A'Obeyd, its pl. is أَبْنَآءٌ; and in like
manner, أَجْنَآءٌ is pl. of جَانٍ: and hence the prov.,
أَبْنَاؤُهَا أَجْنَاؤُهَا, (M,) or أَجْنَاؤُهَا أَبْنَاؤُهَا, i. e. The
injurers thereof, meaning this house (هٰذِهِ الدَّار), by
demolishing it, are the builders thereof. (S in art.
جنى.) ISd says, I am of opinion that these two
pls. are not used except in this prov.: and J says,
in art. جنى, I think that the prov. is originally
جُنَاتُهَا بُنَاتُهَا; but IB affirms that it is not so: and
he says that the prov. is applied to him who does,
or makes, a thing without consideration, and
commits a fault therein, which he repairs by
undoing what he has done or made: it originated
from the fact that the daughter of a certain king
of El-Yemen, during his absence on a military
expedition, built, by the advice of others, a house,
which he, disliking it, commanded them to demolish. (TA in art. جنى. [See also Freytag's Arab.
Prov. i. 294.]) ―
-b2-  A bridegroom: from بَنَى عَلَى
أَهْلِهِ [q. v.]. (TA.) And hence, Any one going
in to his wife. (S, TA.) ―
-b3-  قَوْسٌ بَانِيةٌ A bow
cleaving to its string (T, S, M, K) so that it (the
latter) almost breaks; (T, S, M;) the doing of
which is a fault; (M;) contr. of بَائِنَةٌ [q. v.]:
(S and M in art. بين:) and so ↓ بَانَاةٌ (T, M, K)
in the dial. of Teiyi: (T, M:) or the latter signifies widely separate from its string [like بَائِنَةٌ].
(TA.)
بَانَاةٌ: see بَانٍ. ―
-b2-  Also, (in [some of] the copies
of the K erroneously written بانات, TA,) A man
bending himself over his bow-string when shooting.
(M, K.) ―
-b3-  And Small نَبْل [or arrows]. (M and
TA in art. بين.)
بَانِيَةٌ fem. of بَانٍ [q. v.]. ―
-b2-  Also sing. of بَوَانٍ,
(TA,) which signifies The ribs of [the breast, or
of the part thereof called] the زَوْر: (M, K:) or
the bones of the breast: or the shoulder-blades
and the four legs: (TA:) and the legs of a she-camel. (M, K.) One says, [likening a man to a
camel lying down,] أَلْقَى بَوَانِيهُ, meaning He took
up his abode, and settled, (T, M, K,) in a place;
like أَلْقَى عَصَاهُ. (T, M.) أَلْقَى الشَّأْمُ بَوَانِيَهُ [meaning Syria became in a settled state] occurs in a
trad. as related by A'Obeyd: and if he said
بَوَائِنَهُ, it would be allowable; بَوَائِنُ being pl. of
بوان, [i. e. بُوَانٌ or بِوَانٌ,] which is a name for
any tent-pole except in the middle of the بَيْت,
which has three poles. (T.) And it is said in
another trad., أَلْقَتِ السَّمَآءُ بِرَكَ بَوَانِيهَا, meaning
The sky cast down the rain that it contained.
(TA.)
اِبْنٌ, meaning A son; (M, Mgh, K;) because
he is the father's building, made to be so by God;
(Er-Rághib, TA;) and (tropical:)  a son's son; and (tropical:)  a
descendant more remote; (Msb;) is with a conjunctive ا [when not immediately preceded by a
quiescence, written ابْنٌ]; (Zj, T, M;) [and when
immediately preceded by the proper name of a
man and immediately followed by the proper
name of his parent, written without the ا, as in
زَيْدُ بْنُ عَمْرٍو Zeyd the son of 'Amr (in which
case it should also be observed that the former
proper name is without tenween); unless the
words compose a proposition, as in زَيْدٌ ابْنُ عَمْرٍو
Zeyd is the son of 'Amr; or in the case of an
interrogation, as in هَلْ زَيْدٌ ابْنُ عَمْرٍو Is Zeyd
the son of 'Amr?]: the pl. is ↓ بَنُونَ (T, S, Mgh,
Msb) in the nom. case, and بَنِينَ in the accus.
and gen.; (Mgh;) and أَبْنَآءٌ, (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb,
K,) which is a pl. of pauc.: (Msb:) [and hence
it is argued that] the sing. is of the measure فَعَلٌ
with the final radical letter elided and the conjunctive ا prefixed; (M;) originally بَنَىٌ, (M, K,)
with ى, as we judge, because [the aor.] يَبْنِى is
more common than يَبْنُو: (M:) or originally بَنَوٌ,
(S, Msb, K,) with two fet-hahs, because it has
بَنُونَ for a pl., and the perfect pl. does not admit
of change [in its vowels beyond that which is here
made in بَنُونَ for بَنَوُونَ]; (Msb;) and because it
has for a pl. أَبْنَآءٌ, like as جَمَلٌ has أَجْمَالٌ; (S;)
and the elided letter is و, (Akh, T, S,) as in أَبٌ
and أَخٌ, (S,) because و is more commonly elided
than ى; (Akh, T;) or because the fem. is بِنْتٌ
and [that of أَخٌ is] أُخْتٌ; for we do not see this ه
[or ت] affixed in the fem. except when و is elided
in the masc., as is shown by أَخَوَاتٌ and هَنَوَاتٌ;
(S;) though بُنُوَّةٌ is not a decisive proof that the
last radical is و, for a reason stated above in the
explanation of it: (T:) or, as some say, it is
originally بِنْوٌ, with kesr to the. ب, like حِمْلٌ,
because they say بِنْتٌ, and a change [of a vowel]
in a case of this kind is rare: (Msb:) [but J
says,] it may not be of the measure فِعْلٌ nor فُعْلٌ,
because it has بَنُونَ with fet-h to the ب, for a pl.;
nor of the measure فَعْلٌ, because this has [generally] for its [broken] pl. أَفْعُلٌ or فُعُولٌ: (S:) Zj
says that it is originally بِنْىٌ or بِنْوٌ, or it may be
originally بَنًا; that it is app. the last accord. to
those who say بَنُون; and that أَبْنَآءٌ may be pl. of
the measure فَعَلٌ and of فِعْلٌ; that بِنْتٌ favours
its being of the latter; but that it may be of the
measure فَعَلٌ changed to فِعْلٌ, as فَعَلٌ is changed
to فُعْلٌ in the case of أُخْتٌ. (T.) Beside the pls.
mentioned above, اِبْنٌ has a quasi-pl. n., namely
↓ أَبْنَى, of the same measure as أَعْمَى; (Mgh, TA; *)
a sing. denoting the pl.: or, as some say, اِبْنٌ has
for pls. أَبْنَآءٌ and أَبْنَى. (TA.) Lh mentions the
phrase, هٰؤُلَآءِ أَبْنَا أَبْنَائِهِمْ [or أَبْنَى ابنائهم These are
the sons of their sons.]. (M.) Sometimes م is
affixed to اِبْنٌ [so that it becomes ↓ اِبْنُمٌ or اِبْنَمٌ at
the beginning of a sentence, and ↓ ابْنُمٌ or ابُنَمٌ in
other cases]: the word is then doubly declinable
[like اِمْرُؤٌ or امْرُأٌ]: you say, هٰذَا ابْنُمٌ [This is a
son], and رَأَيْتُ ابْنَمًا [I saw a son], and مَرَرْتُ بِابْنِمٍ
[I passed by a son]; making the ن similarly
declinable to the م; and the ا is with kesr in
every case [when the word commences a sentence,
whether you make the word doubly declinable or
not]: (AHeyth, * S:) [for] some make it singly
declinable, leaving the ن with fet-h in every case
[as the ر in اِمْرَأٌ or امْرَأٌ]; saying, هٰذَا ابْنَمُكَ [This
is thy son], and رَأَيْتُ ابْنَمَكَ [I saw thy son], and
مَرَرْتُ بِابْنَمِكَ [I passed by thy son]. (AHeyth,
TA.) Hassán says,
وَلَدْنَا بَنِى العَنْقَآءِ وَابْنَىْ مُحَرِّقٍ
↓ فَأَكْرِمْ بِنَا خَالًا وَأَكْرِمْ بِنَا ابْنَمَا
[We begot the sons of El-'Ankà, and the two sons
of Moharrik; and how generous are we as a
maternal uncle! and how generous are we as a
son!], (S, K, *) i. e., ابْنَا: the م is augmentative,
and the hemzeh [or rather ا] is that of conjunction.
(K.) And Ru-beh says,
↓ فَهْىَ تُنَادِى بِأَبِى وَابْنِيمَا  بُكَآءَ شَكْلَى فَقَدَتْ حَمِيمَا
[As the weeping of a bereft woman, who has lost
a relation, therefore she calls out, With my
father would I ransom thee, and a son]; meaning
ابْنِمَا. (TA.) The fem. of اِبْنٌ is ↓ اِبْنَةٌ or ابْنَةٌ
[with the conjunctive ا when not commencing a
sentence] and ↓ بِنْتٌ [meaning A daughter; and
(assumed tropical:)  any female descendant]: (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb,
K:) accord. to Sb, (M,) اِبْنَةٌ is formed from اِبْنٌ
by affixing ه [or ة]; but not so بِنْتٌ; for this is
formed by affixing ى as a letter of quasi-coordination, and then substituting for it ت: (M, K:)
[but if the ت be substituted for ى, it seems more
probable that the ى is the final radical:] or, as
some say, the ت is substituted for و: (M:) [Mtr
says,] the ت is substituted for the final radical:
(Mgh:) accord. to Ks, it is originally with ه [or
ة], because it has a fem. meaning: (IAar, Msb:)
[my own opinion is most agreeable with this of
Ks; and with that of Zj, which will be mentioned
below; or, perhaps, is identical with that of Zj:
I think it most probable that, as اِبْنٌ is generally
held to be originally بَنَىٌ or بَنَوٌ, so اِبْنَةٌ and بِنْتٌ
are both originally بَنَيَةٌ or بَنَوَةٌ, and that بِنْتٌ
is formed from اِبْنَةٌ by suppressing the alif,
transferring its kesreh to the ب, making the ن
quiescent, and changing the ة into ت, which is
therefore said to be not the sign of the fem.
gender, either because it is not ة, but is a substitute for ة, or because it is preceded by a quiescent letter:] AHn says that the ت is substituted
for the final radical letter, which is و; and that it
is not the sign of the fem. gender, because the
letter [next] before it is quiescent: this [he says]
is the opinion of Sb, and is the right opinion;
for he says that if you were to use it as the proper
name of a man, you would make it perfectly
decl.; and if the ت were to denote the fem.
gender, the name would not be perfectly decl.:
(TA:) and the same is said respecting the ت in
أُخْتٌ: (TA in art. اخو:) this ت remains in a
case of pause (Ks, IAar, S, Msb) as in the case
of the connexion of the word with a word following: (S:) but one should not say اِبِنْتٌ, (Th, T,
S.) because the ا is required only on account of
the quiescence of the ب, and is therefore dropped
when this is made movent: (S:) Zj says that, in
forming the pl. of بِنْتٌ [and of اِبْنَةٌ], the sing.
is reduced to its original form, which is فَعْلَةٌ [as
I find it written in the transcript from the T in
the TT, but it may be a mistake for فَعَلَپٌ,] with
the last radical letter suppressed: (T in TT:)
the pl. is بَنَاتٌ (T, S, Msb) alone: (S:) [and
this is generally treated as a fem. pl. of the
perfect, or sound, kind, although the ت in بِنْتٌ
is said to be not a sign of the fem. gender; so
that you say, رَأَيْتُ بَنَاتِكَ I saw thy daughters;
but sometimes] one says, رَأَيْتُ بَنَاتَكَ, with fet-h
[as the case-ending], treating the ت as a radical
letter. (S.) It is said in the Bári' that when
men and women are mixed together, the masc.
pl. is made predominant; so that one says, بَنُو
فُلَانٍ [meaning The sons and daughters, or the
children, of such a one]; and even, اِمْرَأَةٌ مِنْ بَنى
تَمِيمٍ [A woman of the children of Temeem]; and
accordingly, if بَنُو فُلَانٍ is applied to denote the
persons to whom a legacy is left, the males and the
females are included therein. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  When
اِبْن is applied to that which is not a human being,
(IAmb, Msb,) to an irrational being, (Msb,) it
has for its pl. بَنَات: (IAmb, Msb:) thus the pl.
of اِبْنُ مَخَاضٍ [A young male camel in his second
year] is بَنَاتُ مَخَاضٍ: (Mgh, Msb:) that of اِبْنُ
لَبُونٍ [A male camel that has entered upon his
third year] is بَنَاتُ لَبُونٍ: (Msb:) and that of
اِبْنُ نَعْشٍ [Any one of the stars of the tail of Ursa
Major or of that of Ursa Minor] is بَنَاتُ نَعْشٍ;
but sometimes, by poetic licence, بَنُو نَعْشٍ: and
hence, or to make a distinction between the males
and the females, the lawyers say, بَنُو اللَّبُونِ.
(IAmb, Msb.) ―
-b3-  ↓ بَنَاتٌ also signifies (tropical:)  Dolls with
which young girls play: (S, Mgh, K:) sing. بِنْتٌ.
(Mgh.) It occurs in this sense in a trad., in
which 'Áïsheh speaks of her playing therewith
(S, Mgh) when, being nine years of age, she was
conducted as a bride to Mohammad. (Mgh.) ―
-b4-
اِبْن is often prefixed to some other noun (T, M,
Msb) that particularizes its signification, because of
a close connexion between the two meanings:
(Msb:) and so is ↓ بِنْت. (T, M.) [Most of the
compounds thus formed will be found explained
in the arts. to which belong the nouns that occupy
the second place. The following are among the
more common, and are therefore here mentioned,
as exs. of different kinds.] ―
-b5-  اِبْنُ الطِّينِ [The
son of earth, or clay, meaning] Adam. (T.)
اِبْنُ اللَّيْلِ and اِبْنُ الطَّرِيقِ The thief, or robber.
(T.) Also the former, The wayfarer, or traveller;
(Er-Rághib, TA;) and so اِبْنُ السَّبِيلِ. (Msb,
Er-Rághib.) اِبْنُ حَرْبٍ A warrior: (Er-Rághib,
TA:) and اِبْنُ الحَرْبِ [the warrior; or] he who
suffices for war, and who defends. (Msb.) اِبْنُ
الدُّنْيَا The rich man. (Msb.) ―
-b2-  اِبْنُ آوَى [The
jackal;] a certain beast of prey. (TA.) اِبْنُ عِرْسٍ
The سُرْعُوب [or weasel]. (TA.) ―
-b3-  اِبْنُ أَدِيمٍ A
skin for water or milk made of one hide; and
اِبْنُ أَدِيمَيْنِ one made of two hides; and اِبْنُ ثَلَاثَهِ
آدِمَةٍ one made of three hides. (T.) ―
-b4-  اِبْنَةُ الجَبَلِ
The echo. (T.) ―
-b5-  بَنَاتُ بِئْسٍ and بَنَاتُ طَبَقٍ and
بَنَاتُ بَرْحٍ and بَنَاتُ أَوْدَكَ Calamities, or misfortunes. (T.) ―
-b6-  Ru-beh said of a man who
was mentioned to him, كَانَ إِحْدَى بَنَاتِ مَسَاجِدِ
اللّٰهِ; as though he asserted that He was one of
the pebbles of the mosque [or rather of the mosques
of God]. (S.)
اِبْنَةٌ or ابْنَةٌ: fem. of اِبْنٌ, which see.
اِبْنُمٌ and اِبْنَمٌ, or ابْنُمٌ and ابْنَمٌ: see اِبْنٌ, in
three places.
أَبْنَى: quasi-pl. n. of اِبْنٌ which see.
اِبْنَىٌّ: see بَنَوِىٌّ.
ابْنِيمَا, for ابْنِمَا: see a verse cited voce اِبْنٌ.
أُبَيْنٌ [an unused, or unusual, dim. of اِبْنٌ]: see
what next follows.
أُبَيْنٍ, of the same measure as أُعَيْمٍ, is the dim.
of أَبْنَى, which is like أَعْمَى, (Sb, IB, Mgh,) and
is quasi-pl. of اِبْنٌ. (Mgh.) Mohammad is related, in a trad., to have said, أُبَيْنِى لَا تَرْمُوا جَمْرَةَ
العَبَقَبِةِ حَتَّى تَطْلُعَ الشَّمْسُ [O little (meaning dear)
sons, cast not ye the pebble of the 'Akabeh (see
جَمْرَةٌ) until the sun rise], (TA,) or أُبَيْنِىَّ الخ [O
my little sons &c.]: (Mgh, TA:) IAth says that
the hemzeh is augmentative; and that there are
differences of opinion respecting the form of the
word and its meaning: some say that it is the
dim. of أَبْنَى, like أَعْمَى, a sing. word denoting a
pl. meaning, or, accord. to some, a pl. of اِبْنٌ,
as well as أَبْنَآءٌ: some say that it is the dim. of
اِبْنٌ; [and if so, we must read أُبَيْنِى my little
son;] but this requires consideration [more especially as it is followed by a pl. verb]: AO says
that it is the dim. of بَنِىَّ, pl. of اِبْنٌ with the
affixed pronoun of the first pers. [sing.]; and this
requires us to read أُبَيْنِىَّ. (TA.) J says, in the
S, that the dim. of أَبْنَآءٌ [pl. of اِبْنٌ] is ↓ أُبَيْنَآءٌ, and,
if you will, ↓ أُبَيْنُونَ; and he cites a verse in
which occurs the expression أُبَيْنِيكَ, [in the gen.
case, meaning thy little sons,] and adds, it is as
though its sing. were إِبْنٌ, with the disjunctive ا,
whence the dim. ↓ أُبَيْنٌ, in the pl. أُبَيْنُونَ: but he
should have said, as though its sing. were أَبْنَى,
like أَعْمَى, originally أَبْنَوُ. (IB, TA.)
أُبَيْنَآء: see what next precedes.
أُبَيْنُونَ: see what next precedes.
مِبْنَاةٌ (T, S, M, K) and مَبْنَاةٌ (M, K) A نِطْع
[like بِنَآءٌ, which see for an explanation]: (S, M,
K:) and a سِتْر [i. e. curtain or the like]: (K:)
or a thing in the form of a سِتْر: (M:) or a [tent
of the kind called] قُبَّة, made of skins, or hides:
(IAar, T:) or a thing of skins, or hides, of like
form to the قُبَّة, which a woman places in, or at,
the side of her tent (فِى كِسْرِ بَيْتِهَا), and in which
she dwells; and may-be she has sheep, or goats,
and is content with the possession of these, exclusively of the other sheep, or goats, for herself
and her garments [and app. for making of their
skins her مبناه]; and she has a covering (إِزَار)
[extended] in the middle of the بَيْت [or tent],
within, to protect her from the heat, and from the
violent rain, so that she and her clothes are not
wetted: (Aboo-'Adnán, T:) or, accord. to As, a
mat (حَصِيرٌ), or a نِطْع, which the trafficker
spreads upon the things that he sells: and they
used to put the mats (الحُصُر) upon the أَنْطَاع [pl.
of نِطْع], and go round about with them [in the
market]: the مبناة is thus called because it is made
of skins joined together: (T:) also a receptacle of
the kind called عَيْبَة: (M, K:) such is said to be
its meaning: (S:) pl. مَبَانٍ. (T.)
مَبْنِىٌّ [Built, &c.: see 1]. أَرْضٌ مَبْنِيَّةٌ means
أَرْضٌ مَبْنِىٌّ فِيهَا [Land built in or upon]; and is
deemed a chaste phrase. (Mgh.)
مُبَنًّى Raised high; applied to a palace, or
pavilion. (M, TA.)
مُبْتَنًى [pass. part. n. of اِبْتَنَاهُ] is used in the
place of the inf. n. [of that verb, agreeably with
many other instances, or accord. to a common
licence], meaning The act of building, framing,
or constructing. (TA.)
