بَخُقَ; He had
that affection of an eye which is termed بَخَقُ,
explained below. (K.) [And,] accord. to ISd,
بَخَقَتْ عَيْنُهُ, and بَخِقَتْ, His eye went away; or
perished: and i. q. عَارَتْ [his eye became blind;
or became wanting; or sank in its socket]: the
more approved form is [بَخَقَتْ,] with fet-h [to
the medial radical]: and it is also explained as
meaning فُقِئَتْ [it was put out; or was blinded;
&c.]: (TA:) or, accord. to the Mj, بَخِقَتِ العَيْنُ

is also termed the شَحْمَة,] of the eye disappeared:
and the epithet applied to the eye in this case

that in which there is most [of the foul matter
termed] غَمَص: [in the CK, for أَكْثَرُهُ غَمَصًا, is
erroneously put اَكْثَرُهُ غَمْضًا; and so I find in
the JK:] or the state in which the edge of one's
