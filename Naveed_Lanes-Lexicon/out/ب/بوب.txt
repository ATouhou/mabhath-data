بوب1
بَابَ لَهُ, aor. يَبُوبُ, (M, K,) quasi-inf. n., if
there be such a verb, بِوَابَةٌ, with the و not changed
into ى because it is not an inf. n. properly speaking, but a subst., (Lth, T,) He was, or became, a
door-keeper, or gate-keeper, to him; (M, K;)
namely, a Sultán (M) [or other person].

بوّب [app., (assumed tropical:)  He practised what are termed
أَبْوَابُ الحَرْبِ, meaning the expedients, tricks, or
stratagems, of war, battle, or fight. ―
-b2-  And hence,]
(assumed tropical:)  He charged upon, attacked, or assaulted, the
enemy. (AA, T.)
-A2-  بَوَّبْتُ الأَشْيَآءَ (assumed tropical:)  I made the
things to be divided into distinct أَبْوَاب [meaning
kinds, or sorts; or I disposed, arranged, distributed, or classified, the things under distinct heads].
(Msb.) And بوّب الأَبْوَابَ (assumed tropical:)  [He disposed, arranged, distributed, classified, or set in order, the
kinds, sorts, classes, chapters, heads, or the like].
(TA voce أَصَّلَ, q. v.) And بوّب المُؤَلِّفُ كِتَابَهُ
(assumed tropical:)  [The author disposed, or divided, his book in, or
into, distinct chapters]. (A.) [See بَابٌ.]
5
تبوّب, (A,) or تبوّب بَوَّابًا, (S, M, K,) He
took for himself a door-keeper, or gate-keeper.
(S, M, A, K.)
بَابٌ, originally بَوَبٌ, (M, Msb,) A door; a
gate; a place of entrance: and the thing with
which a place of entrance, such as a door or gate,
is closed; of wood &c.: (MF, TA:) pl. أَبْوَابٌ
(S, M, Msb, K) and بِيبَانٌ (M, K) and أَبْوِبَةٌ, (S,
M, K,) [a pl. of pauc., said to be] only used for
conformity with another word mentioned therewith, as in the saying (of Ibn-Mukbil, so in a
copy of the S),
هَتَّاكُ أَخْبِيَةٍ وَ لَّاجُ أَبْوِبَةٍ
[A frequent render of tents, a frequent enterer of
doors], (S, M,) not being allowable when occurring alone; (S;) but IAar and Lh assert that it
is a pl. of باب without its being used for conformity with another word; (M;) and this is
extr.; (M, K;) for باب is of the measure فَعَلٌ,
and a word of this measure has not a pl. of the
measure أَفْعِلَةٌ [by rule]. (M.) You say, بَابٌ
الدَّارِ [The door of the house]; and بَابُ البَيْتِ
[the door of the house, and of the chamber, and of
the tent]; (Msb;) and بَابُ البَلَدِ [the gate of the
town or city]. (The Lexicons &c. passim.) And
Bishr Ibn-Abee-Házim assigns a باب to a grave;
calling the latter a بَيْت. (M.) It is also applied
to an opening, or a channel, made for water, to
irrigate seed-produce: pl. أَبْوَابٌ. (Mgh.) [And
in Egypt, it is applied also to A sepulchral chamber, grotto, or cave, hewn in a mountain; from
the Coptic
βηβ: pl. بِيبَانٌ only.] ―
-b2-  Hence, i. e.
in a secondary application, the primary signification being “ a place of entrance,” it is used as
meaning (tropical:)  A means of access, or of attainment, to
a thing: (B, Kull, TK:) as in the saying, هٰذَا
العِلْمُ بَابٌ إِلَى عِلْمِ كَذَا (tropical:)  This science is a means
of attainment to such a science. (B, TK.) ―
-b3-
[And hence, (assumed tropical:)  An expedient, a trick, a stratagem,
or a process, by which something is to be effected
pl. أَبْوَابٌ: as in أَبْوَابُ الحَرْبِ the expedients. &c.
of war, battle, or fight; and بَابٌ مِنَ النُّجُومِ a
process of the science of the stars, meaning astrology or astronomy; and بَابٌ مِنَ السِّحْرِ a process
of enchantment; see an ex. voce سِحْرٌ. Compare
Matt. xvi. 18,
πύλαι ᾅδου οὐ � degreesατισχύσουσιν αύτη�,
probably meaning “ the stratagems of Hell shall
not prevail against it. ”] ―
-b4-  [Also (assumed tropical:)  A mode, kind,
sort, class, or category.] Suweyd Ibn-Kuráa uses
metaphorically the pl. أَبْوَاب in relation to rhymes;
saying,
أَتَيْتُ بِأَبْوَابِ القَوَافِى كَأَنَّمَا
أَذُودُ بِهَا سِرْبًا مِنَ الوَحْشِ نُزَّعَا
(tropical:)  [I gave utterance to the various kinds of rhymes
as though I were driving with them a herd of
wild animals desirous of the males, or of their
wonted places of pasture]. (M, L.) [You say
also, هُوَ مِنْ هٰذَا البَابِ (assumed tropical:)  It is of this mode, kind,
sort, class, or category: a phrase of frequent
occurrence in lexicons &c. See also بَابَةٌ.] ―
-b5-  [Also
(assumed tropical:)  A chapter; and sometimes a section, or subdivision, of a chapter; of a book or writing;]
conventionally, (assumed tropical:)  a piece consisting of words relating to matters of one kind; and sometimes, to
matters of one species: (Kull:) pl. أَبْوَابٌ. (A.)
See also بَابَةٌ. ―
-b6-  [Also (assumed tropical:)  A head, or class of items
or articles, in an account, or a reckoning; as in the
saying,] بَيَّنْتُ لَهُ حِسَابَهُ بَابًا بَابًا (assumed tropical:)  [I explained, or
made clear, to him his account, or reckoning,
head by head, or each class of items or articles
by itself]; a phrase mentioned by Sb: (M:) [or,
sometimes,] بَابٌ (M, K) and ↓ بَابَةٌ (T, M, K) are
used in relation to حُدُود [which here means the
punishments so termed], and to an account, or a
reckoning, (T, M, K,) and the like, (T, M,) as
signifying the extreme term or limit; syn. غَايَةٌ;
(M, K;) but IDrd hesitated respecting this, and
therefore it is not mentioned in the S. (TA.)
بَابَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  A mode, or manner; syn. وَجْهٌ: (ISk,
K:) pl. بَابَاتٌ. (K.) [See also بَابٌ, which has a
similar, and perhaps the same, signification.]
Hence, هٰذَا مِنْ بَابَتِى means (assumed tropical:)  This is of the
mode, or manner, that I desire; (TA;) this is
suitable to me: (IAmb, TA:) and هٰذَا شَىْءٌ مِنْ
بَابَتِكَ, (S,) or هٰذَا بَابَتُكَ, (A,) (assumed tropical:)  this is a thing
suitable to thee: (S, A:) and هٰذَا بَابَتُهُ (assumed tropical:)  this is
suitable to him. (K.) Accord. to most of the
critics, it is tropical. (TA.) You say also, فُلَانٌ
أَهْوَنُ بَابَاتِهِ الكَذِبُ (assumed tropical:)  Such a one, the lightest of
the kinds (أَنْوَاع) of his wickedness is lying. (A.)
―
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  A habit: a property; a quality; nature;
natural disposition: or a practice; or an action:
syn. خَصْلَةٌ. (Abu-l-'Omeythil, TA.) [Hence,
perhaps, the last of the exs. cited above from the
A.] ―
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  A condition; syn. شَرْطٌ: as in the saying,
هذَا بَابَةُ هٰذَا (assumed tropical:)  [This is the condition of this].
(M, K. *) ―
-b4-  بَابَاتُ الكِتَابِ (assumed tropical:)  The lines of the book
or writing: (M, A, K:) or it may mean its
↓ أَبْوَاب [i. e. chapters, or sections of chapters]:
(M:) this has no sing.: (A, K:) [ISd says,] I
have not heard any sing. of it. (M.) ―
-b5-  See also
بَابٌ; last signification.
بَوْبَاةٌ A desert; or a desert in which is no water;
syn. فَلَاةٌ: (T, IJ, M, K:) as also مَوْمَاةٌ; (T, MF;)
the ب being changed into م, as is often the case.
(MF.) [It is mentioned in the S, and again in
the K, in art. بو, as syn. with مَفَازَةٌ.]
بِوَابَةٌ The office, or occupation, of a door-keeper,
or gate-keeper. (M, K.) [See 1.]
بَوَّابٌ A door-keeper, or gate-keeper. (S, * M,
Msb, K, TA.)
أَبْوَابٌ مُبَوَّبَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  [Kinds, sorts, classes, chapters,
heads, or the like, disposed, arranged, distributed,
classified, or set in order,] is a phrase similar
to أَصْنَافٌ مُصَنَّفَةٌ. (S.) You say also كِتَابٌ مُبَوَّبٌ
(assumed tropical:)  [A book disposed in, or divided into, distinct
chapters]. (A.)
Quasi بوج
بَاجٌ; pl. أَبْوَاجٌ: see art. بأج. AZ mentions it
as without ء: ISk, as with ء. (ISd, TA.)
