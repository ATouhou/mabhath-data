saying to a man, أَنْتَ حُجَّةٌ عَلَى نَفْسِكَ: (S:)
the ة is added because the members are meant
thereby; (B;) or to give intensiveness to the
signification, (Mgh, B,) as in عَلَّامَةٌ and رَاوِيَةٌ;
(B;) or because the meaning is عَيْنٌ بَصِيرَةٌ.

M: *) باصرا being here used for the augmented
epithet [مُبْصِرًا]; (M;) or it is a possessive
epithet, (Yaakoob, M,) like لَابِنٌ and تَامِرٌ, meaning ذُو بَصَرٍ, from أَبْصَرْتُ, like مَوْتٌ مَائِتٌ from
