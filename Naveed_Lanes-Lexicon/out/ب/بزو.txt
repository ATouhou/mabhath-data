بزو1
بَزَا, aor. يَبْزُو, i. q. تَطَاوَلَ [app. as meaning
He stretched out his neck, looking at a thing far
off]; and تَأَنَّسَ [here meaning the same, or he
looked, raising his head; said of a hawk, or
falcon]: (Az, ISd, K:) and hence IJ says that
↓ بَازٌ is [originally] of the measure فَلْعٌ from this
verb: (TA: [and it is said in the K that بَازٍ
seems to be hence derived:]) for [or تطاول may
here be used in another sense; for, accord. to Fei,]
بَزَا, aor. as above, signifies he overcame, or subdued; and hence is derived ↓ بَازٍ. (Msb.) You
say also, بَزَا عَلَيْهِ, aor. as above, meaning تطاول
[i. e., thus followed by عليه, He held up his head
with an assumption of superiority over him;
behaved haughtily towards him; exalted himself
above him; or overpowered, subdued, or oppressed,
him]. (S.) And بُزِىَ بِالقَوْمِ The people, or company of men, were overcome, or subdued. (TA.)
And بَزَاهُ, aor. as above, (K,) inf. n. بَزْوٌ, (TA,)
He overcame, or subdued, him; and laid violent
hands upon him, or assaulted him; as also ↓ ابزى
بِهِ: (K:) or this last signifies he overcame him,
and subdued him: (S:) and بَزَاهُ, he wronged him;
or treated him wrongfully, or injuriously: and
↓ ابزاهُ may signify the same; or this may mean
he induced him to become أَبْزَى, q. v.: (Ham p.
502:) and accord. to Aboo-Riyásh, ↓ ابزى signifies he pressed heavily upon his adversary, or
imposed on him that which he was unable to do,
or to bear, in order to treat him wrongfully, or
injuriously. (Ham pp. 104 and 105.) [It is said
that] بَزَوَانٌ [an inf. n. of which the verb, if it
have one, is بَزَا,] signifies the act of Leaping;
syn. وَثْبٌ. (S: [but I think it not improbable
that this may have been taken from a mistranscription of نَزَوَانٌ, an inf. n. of نَزَا.])
-A2-  بَزِىَ,
(K,) aor.
بَزَوَ; (Ham p. 502;) and بَزَا, aor.
بَزُوَ; (K;)
inf. n. بَزًا (S, * K, * TA) and بَزْوٌ, (TA,) He (a
man, TA) had what is termed بَزًا; (K;) i. e.,
prominence of the breast and depression of the
back: (S, K, and Ham ubi suprà:) or depression
of the back and prominence of the belly: or, as
some say, prominence of the breast and depression
of the lower part of the belly: (Ham ubi suprà:)
or depression of the breast and prominence of the
lower part of the belly: (Ham p. 105:) or a
bending in the back next the posteriors: (K, TA:)
or a projecting of the middle of the back over the
posteriors: or a backward bulging of the posteriors: (K:) or he was as though his posteriors
projected over the hinder part of the thighs: or
he had the breast bulging forward and the posteriors backward, so that he appeared unable to
straighten his back. (T, TA.) [See also 4.] The
epithet is أَبْزَى: fem. بَزْوَآءُ. (S, K.)

ابزى: see 1, in three places.
-A2-  Also, (S,
K,) inf. n. إِبْزَآءٌ, (A 'Obeyd, S,) He (a man,
A 'Obeyd, S) elevated his posteriors; (A 'Obeyd,
S, K;) as also ↓ تبازى: (S, K:) or the latter
signifies he acted in such a manner in his walk
as to cause it to be imagined that he was أَبْزَى;
(Ham p. 105;) or he moved his posteriors in
walking, like as does a woman; or he bent, or
bowed, himself to others. (TA.) Accord. to IAar,
البزاء [probably a mistranscription for الإِبْزَآءُ] signifies الصلف [i. e. الصَّلَفُ, app. meaning An
extravagant affecting of elegance of carriage,
such as is common with women]. (TA.)

hawk, or falcon;] a species of صَقْر, (K,) that
preys, or hunts or catches game; (S;) the proudest and fiercest of birds of prey, found in the
country of the Turks: it is said that this name
is only given to the female, and that the male is of
another kind, a kite, or a white falcon (شَاهِين), and
hence the varieties of form &c. in different individuals of the species: that of which the prevailing
colour is white is the best, and the fullest in body,
and the boldest, and the easiest to train: this variety
(the أَشْهَب) is found only in the country of the
Turks, and Armenia, and the country of the Khazar: (Kzw:) [see also بَاشَقٌ:] respecting the derivation, see 1, in two places: the pl. (of بَازٍ, S, ISd,

K;) and (of بَازٌ, Msb) بِيزَانٌ (Msb, K) and أَبْوَازٌ,
(Msb,) the former a pl. of mult., and the latter
a pl. of pauc., (TA,) or the former is originally
بُزْيَانٌ [and therefore a pl. of بَازٍ]; (IKtt, TA in
art. ميد;) and (of بَأْزٌ, K in art. بأز,) أَبْؤُزٌ [a pl.
of pauc.] and بُؤُوزٌ (K in this art. and in art. بأز)

sometimes coupled with أَبْزَخُ; and the fem., with
