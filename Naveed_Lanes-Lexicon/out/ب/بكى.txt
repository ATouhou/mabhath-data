بكى1
بَكَى, aor.
بَكِىَ, (Msb, K,) inf. n. بُكَآءٌ and بُكًا
(S, Msb, K) and مَبْكًى, (Har p. 11,) He wept;
i. e. he lamented, or grieved, shedding tears at the
same time; and he lamented, or grieved, alone;
and he shed tears alone: (Er-Rághib, TA:)
accord. to some, the preferable opinion is, that
there is no difference between بُكَآءُ and بُكًا: (TA:)
or the former means the crying, or uttering of
the voice [of lamentation], (S, IKtt, Msb, TA,
&c.,) that accompanies البُكَآء [so in copies of the
S and in the TA, but correctly البُكَا]; (S, IKtt,
TA;) and the latter (بُكًا), the shedding of tears:
(S, IKtt, Msb, TA, &c.:) or the former, i. e. with
medd, means the shedding of tears by reason of
lamentation, or grief, and raising of the voice,
or crying, [at the same time,] when the voice is
predominant, being like رُغَآءٌ, and ثُغَآءٌ and other
words of the same form applied to denote the
uttering of a cry or of the voice; and the latter,
[the shedding of tears &c.] when lamentation,
or grief, is predominant: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or
by the former is meant the crying, or uttering
of the voice [of lamentation]; and by the latter,
the lamenting, or grieving. (Kh, TA.) تَبْكَآءٌ and
تِبْكَآءٌ [may be inf. ns. of بَكَى or of ↓ بَكَّى, and]
signify the same as بُكَآءٌ: or much بُكَاء [or weeping,
&c.]: (K:) MF asserts that تِبْكَآءٌ (with kesr) and
the former of these explanations are unknown;
but both the word and the explanation are mentioned by Lh, as used in a form of words uttered
by Arab women of the desert to fascinate men:
ISd, however, says that it should be تَبْكَآء, because
it is an inf. n. of a class formed to denote muchness [of the attribute signified by the verb], like
تَهْذَارٌ and تَلْعَابٌ &c.; and IAar says that تَبْكَاءٌ,
with fet-h, has the latter of the two significations
assigned to it above. (TA.) [See what is said
of the measure تِفْعَالٌ voce بَيَّنَ.] You say, بَكَى لَهُ
(MF, TA) and بَكَى عَلَيْهِ, (S, Msb, K, MF,)
meaning [He wept] for, or over, him, or it: and
only بَكَى بِهِ [or thus and also بَكَىمِنْهُ as appears
from what follows] when meaning [He wept]
because, or in consequence, of it: ('Ináyeh, MF,
TA:) and بَكَاهُ and ↓ بَكَّاهُ, (As, AZ, S, Msb, K,)
inf. n. of the former بُكَآءٌ (K) [and بُكًا], and of
the latter تَبْكِيَةٌ, (TA,) signify the same as بَكَى
عَلَيْهِ; (As, AZ, S, Msb, * K;) the object being a
man: (As, S:) and (or as some say, TA) he wept
for, or over, him, i. e., one dead; or did so, and
enumerated his good qualities or actions; syn.
رَثَاهُ: (K:) or, as some say, بَكَاهُ means [he wept
because, or in consequence, of it, i. e.,] on account
of being pained: and بَكَى عَلَيْهِ, [he wept for, or
over, him,] by reason of tenderness of heart, or
compassion: and [hence] it is said that بَكَيْتُهُ is
originally بَكَيْتُ مِنْهُ: (TA:) [and ↓ بَكَّاهُ may
have an intensive, or a frequentative, meaning;
for it is said that] بَكِّى, addressed to the eye,
signifies weep thou much, and repeatedly. (Ham
p. 461.) ―
-b2- [Hence,] بَكَت السَّحَابَةُ (assumed tropical:)  The cloud
rained. (Msb.) ―
-b3-  بَكَى also means He sang:
[in the CK, وبَكَى عَنِّى is erroneously put for
وبَكَى غَنَّى:] thus it has two contr. significations:
(K, TA:) accord. to MF, it has this meaning
only in relation to the pigeon and the like; but
it is also used in this sense when said of a man,
as in a verse cited voce جَنَازَةٌ, q. v. : and he
observes that the assertion of its having two contr
significations requires consideration, seeing that
it is also said to signify رَثَى; [for in the performance of رِثَآء, it is a common practice to sing;] but
رِثَآء is generally accompanied by lamentation, and
غِنَآء by rejoicing. (TA.) ―
-b4-  بَاكَيْتُهُ فَبَكَيْتُهُ: see 3.

بَكَّىَ see 1, in three places:
-A2-  and see also 4.
3
بَاكَيْتُهُ فَبَكَيْتُهُ, (S, TA,) aor. of the latter
أَبْكُوهُ, (TA,) or أَبْكِيهِ, retaining its original form,
accord. to a rule observed in the case of a verb
having an infirm letter [for its second or third
radical] lest a verb with a radical ى should be
confounded with one having a radical و, (Ham
p. 670,) i. e. [I vied with him, or strove to exceed
him, in weeping, and I exceeded him therein, or]
I was a greater weeper (أَبْكَى) than he. (S, TA.)
4
ابكاهُ [He made him, or caused him, to weep;
or] he did to him what made him to weep; (S,
K;) as also ↓ استبكاهُ. (S.) And عَلَيْهِ ↓ بكّاهُ,
inf. n. تَبْكِيَةٌ, He excited him to weep for him, or
it; (K, TA;) namely, a person dead, (K,) or a
thing lost. (TA.)
6
تباكى signifies تَكَلَّفَ البُكَآءَ [i. e. He affected
weeping; or endeavoured, or constrained himself,
to weep]. (S, K.) Hence, in a trad., فَإِنْ لَمْ
تَجِدُوا بُكَآءً فَتَبَاكَوْا [And if ye experience not
weeping, endeavour to weep]: (TA:) [or the
words of the trad. are] اُتْلُوا القُرْآنَ وَابْكُوا فَإِنْ لَمْ
تَبْكُوا فَتَبَاكَوْا [Peruse ye the Kur-án, and weep;
or, if ye weep not, endeavour to do so]. (Bd in
xix. 59.) ―
-b2-  And He feigned, or made a show of,
weeping. (Har p. 602.)
10
استبكاهُ: see 4. ―
-b2-  Also He desired, or required, of him weeping. (TA.)
بَكِىٌّ One who weeps much; (S, K;) as also
↓ بَكَّآءٌ. (K, but omitted in some copies and in the
TA.)
-A2-  رَجُلٌ عَيِيٌّ بَكِىٌّ, A man unable to speak.
(Mbr, TA.) [But perhaps this should be بَكِىْءٌ:
see art. بكأ.]
بَكَّآءٌ: see بَكِىٌّ.
بَاكٍ part. n. of بَكَى [i. e. Weeping, &c.]: (K:)
pl. بُكِىٌّ, (S, K,) of the measure فُعُولٌ, with the و
changed into ى [and the second dammeh consequently into a kesreh, wherefore it is also, sometimes, pronounced بِكِىٌّ], (S,) and بُكَاةٌ, (K,) which
is agreeable with analogy and usage, though said
by Es-Semeen to have not been heard. (TA.)
[The pl. of the fem., i. e. of بَاكِيَةٌ, is بَاكِيَاتٌ and
بَوَاكٍ.]
أَبْكَى [A greater weeper, or one who weeps
more, than another: see 3]. (S, TA.)
