بَحَرَ,] inf. n. بَحْرٌ, (K,) He
slit; cut, or divided, lengthwise; split; or clave;
(K, TA;) and enlarged, or made wide. (TA.)
Hence the term بَحْرٌ [as meaning “ a sea ” or
“ great river ”] is said to be derived, because
what is so called is cleft, or trenched, in the
earth, and the trench is made the bed of its
water. (TA.) ―

-b3-  أَبْحَرَتِ

-A2-  (assumed tropical:)  He
found water to be salt; not easy, or pleasant,
to be drunk. (K, TA. [In some copies of the

-A3-  He met, or met with, a

لَقِيتُهُ صَحْرَةَ بَحْرَةَ. (TA.)

went deep into science, or knowledge, and enlarged

بَحْرٌ [A sea: and a great river:] a spacious
place comprising a large quantity of water; (B;)
a large quantity of water, (K, TA,) whether salt
or sweet; (TA;) contr. of بَرٌّ; (S, A;) so called
because of its depth (S, TA) and large extent;
(S, Msb, TA;) from البَحَارَةُ; (A;) or because
its bed is trenched in the earth; see 1: (TA:)
or a large quantity of salt water, only; (K;)
and so called because of its saltness: (El-Umawee, TA: [but accord. to the A, this word
as an epithet meaning “ salt ” is tropical:]) or
rather this is its general meaning: (TA:) for
it signifies also any great river; (S, M, TA;)
any river of which the water does not cease to
flow; (Zj, T, TA;) such as the Euphrates, for
instance; (S;) or such as the Tigris, and the
Nile, and other similar great rivers of sweet

of confluence; so called because trenched in the
earth: (T, TA:) pl. [of pauc.] أَبْحُرٌ and [of
mult.] بِحَارٌ and بُحُورٌ. (S, Msb, K.) The dim.
is ↓أُبَيْحِرٌ, (K,) which is anomalous; and ↓بُحَيْرٌ,
which is the regular form: accord. to the K, the
latter is not used; but this is untrue; for it is
sometimes used, though rare. (MF.) ―
-b2-  Hence
its application in the saying of the Arabs, يَا هَادِىَ
اللَّيْلِ جُرْتَ إِنَّمَا هُوَ البَحْرُ أَوِ الفَجْرُ, which Th
explains by saying that the meaning is, (tropical:)  [O
guide of the night, thou hast deviated from the
right way:] it is only destruction or thou wilt
see the daybreak: the night is here likened to
the sea [and with the night is associated the idea
of destruction]: but accord. to one recital, it is
البَجْرُ, instead of البَحْرُ. (TA. [See art. بجر.])

the sea, or a great river, when it rolls wave over
wave. (Niftaweyh;, TA.) ―
-b5-  (tropical:)  A generous man;
(K, TA;) one who takes a wide range in his
beneficence, bounty, or kindness; who abounds
therein. (TA.) You say, لَقِيتُ بِزَيْدٍ بَحْرًا (tropical:)  [I
found, in the place of Zeyd, a man of abundant
generosity or beneficence]: ب here denoting substitution. (The Lubáb cited in the TA voce بِ.)
And لَقِيتُ مِنْهُ بَحْرًا (tropical:)  [I found him to be a man
of exceeding generosity]; a phrase expressing an
intensive degree of generosity: and رَأَيْتُ مِنْهُ
بَحْرًا [signifies the same]. (Mughnee in art. بِ.)

of seed-produce and fruitfulness; or a tract, or
region, in which are green herbs or leguminous
plants, and waters; or the part of a country
near to water; syn. رِيفٌ: (Aboo-' Alee, K:) and
the dim. ↓ بُحَيْرٌ is used in the same sense; or,
by poetic licence, for ↓ بُحَيْرَةٌ. (TA.) So in the
Kur [xxx. 40], ظَهَرَ الفَسَادُ فِى البَرِّ وَ البَحْرِ (assumed tropical:) [Corruption hath appeared in the desert, or deserts,
and in the land of seed-produce and fruitfulness;
&c.]: (Aboo-'Alee, TA:) or the meaning here is,
[in the desert, or deserts, and in the towns, or villages, in which is water: (see بَرٌّ:) or in the open
country and] in the cities [or towns] upon the
rivers; by sterility in the former, and scarcity
in the latter: (Zj, TA, and T in art. بر:) or in
the land and the sea; i. e., the land has become
sterile, or unfruitful, and the supply of the sea
has become cut off. (Az, TA.) See also بَحْرَةٌ. ―

as in the Towsheeh of El-Jelál. (TA.) ―
-b3-  Any
town, or village, that has a running river and
wholesome water: (K:) and [absolutely] any
town, or village: of such the Arabs say, هٰذِهِ
بَحْرَتُنَا This is our town, or village: and the pl.
بِحَارٌ they apply to cities, as well as towns,
or villages. (TA.) ―

of the K and in the TA,) or بُحْرٌ, (as in the CK,)
and بِحَارٌ. (K.)
-A2-  لَقِيتُهُ صَحْرَةَ بَحْرَةَ, (S, K,) and
↓ صُحْرَةَ بُحْرَةَ, as in the Expositions of the Tesheel, &c., (MF,) and صَحْرَةً بَحْرَةً, (K,) and
↓ صُحْرَةً بُحْرَةً, (MF,) I met him out, with nothing
intervening between me and him; (S, L;) both
of us being exposed to open view; (TA;) without
anything concealing, or intervening. (K, TA.)
صحرةَ بحرةَ, without tenween, is a compound
denotative of state; not, as some say, consisting
of two inf. ns.: and sometimes نَحْرَةً is added;
in which case each of the three words is with tenween, decl.; and they do not form a compound.

the sudden change which happens to a sick person,
(S, TA,) and the commencement of convalescence,
(TA,) in acute diseases; (S, TA;) at a time
fixed by some motion in the heavenly bodies,
mostly by a motion of the moon; being a change
to health or to the contrary: a word [said to be]
of Greek origin. (The Nuzheh of the sheykh
Dáwood El-Antákee, cited in the TA.) [Pl.
بَحَارِينُ.] They say, هٰذَا يَوْمُ بُحْرَانٍ and يَوْمٌ
↓ بَاحُورِىٌّ [This is the day of a crisis of a disease]:
باحورىّ being anomalous: (S, K:) [perhaps from
البَاحُورُ signifying “ the moon,” because the crisis
of a disease is thought to be mostly fixed by a
motion of the moon: or] as though it were a
rel. n. of بَاحُورٌ and بَاحُورَآءُ meaning the “ vehemence of heat in [the month of] تَمُّوز. ” (S.)

or (assumed tropical:)  pure blood of an intensely red colour:
(Msb:) both from البَحْرُ signifying “ the bottom
of the womb: ”: (S:) the former is a rel. n. therefrom, (A, IAth, Msb,) in which the ا and ن are
added to give intensiveness to the signification,
(IAth,) or to distinguish it from the rel. n. of
البَحْرُ [in its most common sense]: (Msb:) or
it is a rel. n. of البَحْرُ [in its most common sense],
because of its abundance. (IAth.) ―
-b2-  أَحْمَرُ
بَحْرَانِىٌّ, and ↓ بَاحِرٌ, (TA,) and ↓ بَاحِرِىٌّ, (IAar,

بَحِيرَةٌ A she-camel having her ear slit: (S, *
A, Msb, K *:) [and, as a subst., or an epithet in
which the quality of a subst. is predominant,]
a she-camel of which the mother was a سَائِبَة;
(Fr, S, Mgh, Msb, K;) i. e., of which the mother
had brought forth ten females consecutively before
her, and of which the ear was slit; (Mgh;) or
of which the mother had brought forth five, of
which five the last, if a male, was slaughtered and
eaten, but if a female, her ear was slit and she
was left with her mother; (Mgh, * Msb;) the
predicament of which was the same as that of
her mother; (Fr, S, K;) i. e., what was unlawful with respect to her mother was unlawful with
respect to herself: (TA:) or a she-camel, or ewe,
or she-goat, that had brought forth five young
ones, and of which the fifth, if a male, was
slaughtered, and its flesh was eaten by the men
and women; but if a female, her ear was slit,
and it was unlawful to the Arabs to eat her flesh
and to drink her milk and to ride her; but when
she died, her flesh was lawful to the women: (K:)
so says Az, on the authority of Ibn-'Arafeh:
(TA: [but it appears from the explanation in the
Msb, quoted above, that it was the slit-eared
young she-camel here mentioned, not the mother,
that was thus termed:]) or a she-camel, or ewe,
or she-goat, which, having brought forth ten
young ones, had her ear slit, (K,) and no use
was made of her milk nor of her back, (TA,)
and she was left at liberty to pasture, (K,) and
to go to water, (TA,) and her flesh, when she died,
was made unlawful to the women of the Arabs,
but was eaten by the men: (K:) or one that
was left at liberty, without a pastor: (K:) or,
as some say, syn. with سَائِبَةٌ; i. e., say they, a
she-camel which, having brought forth seven young
ones, had her ear slit, and was not ridden, nor
used for carrying: (Msb:) or a she-camel that
had brought forth five young ones, the last of
which was a male, in which case her ear was slit,
and she was exempted from being ridden and
from carrying and from being slaughtered, and
not prevented from taking of any water to which
she came, nor from any pasturage, nor even
ridden by a weary man who, having become unable to proceed in his journey, his means having
failed him, or his camel that bore him stopping
with him from fatigue or breaking down or
perishing, might chance to find her: (Aboo-Is-
hák the Grammarian, TA: [and the like, but
less fully, is said in the Mgh:]) or, applied
specially to a ewe, or she-goat, one that, having
brought forth five young ones, had her ear slit:
(L, K, TA: [in the CK, for بُحِرَت is put
نُحِرَت:]) it also signifies a she-camel (L) abounding in milk: (L, K:) the pl. is بَحَائِرُ and بُحُرٌ;
(L, K;) the latter a strange form of pl. of a fem.
sing. such as بحيرة; and said to be the only instance
of the kind except صُرُمٌ pl. of صَرِيمَةٌ, meaning
“ having her ear cut off. ” (TA.) It is said in a
trad., that the person who instituted the practices
relative to the بحيرة and the حَامِى, and the first
who altered the religion of Ishmael, was 'Amr the
son of Loheí the son of Kama'ah the son of
Jundab; and these practices are forbidden in the
Kur v. 102. (TA.)
بُحَيْرَةٌ A small sea; a lake: as though they
imagined the word بَحْرَةٌ [as syn. with بَحْرٌ]:
otherwise there is no reason for the ة. (M, TA.)

بَاحُورٌ and ↓بَاحُورَآءُ The vehemence of heat in
[the Syrian month of] تَمُّوز or تَمُوز [corresponding to July, O. S.]: (S, K:) [pl. of the former
بَوَاحِيرُ:] both are [said to be] post-classical
words: (S:) but they are [classical words,] arabicized; for they occur in verses of the kind
called رَجَز of some of the [early] Arabs. (MF.)
