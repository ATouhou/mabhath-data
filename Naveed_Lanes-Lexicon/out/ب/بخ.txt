بخR. Q. 1
بَخْبَخَ, (S, K,) inf. n. بَخْبَخَةٌ and
بِخْبَاخٌ, (TA,) [a verb imitative of the sound
which it signifies,] He (a camel [in a state of
excitement]) brayed, (S, K,) so that his شِقْشِقَة
[or faucial bag] filled his mouth: (S:) or, as
some say, began to bray. (TA.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,
perhaps,] He (a man) said [بَخْ] or بَخْ بَخْ [&c.].
(TA, and Har p. 556.) ―
-b3-  And [hence,] بَخْبَخَ
بِصُحْبَتِى He rejoiced in my company. (Har ubi
suprà.) ―
-b4-  And بَخْبَخَ الرَّجُلَ He said بَخْ or بَخْ بَخْ
&c. to the man. (S.)
بَخْ, (S, A, K, &c.,) [in some copies of the K
written بَخَّ, which is wrong, for it is] like بَلْ,
(A,) [i. e.] like قَدْ, (TA,) [perhaps, as I have
suggested above, from the sound made by a hecamel in a state of excitement,] a word used on
the occasion of praising; (S, A;) on praising one
from whom has proceeded a good and wonderful
action; (Har p. 142;) on approving a thing; (T,
S, Msb, K;) on being pleased with it, or having
one's admiration excited by it; (A, K;) or on the
occasion of glorying and of praising; (K;) in
pronouncing a thing great in estimation, (IAmb,)
or excellent; (AHeyth;) in deeming a thing
great in estimation, (AHei,) or good; (Mgh;)
or it means wonder, or admiration; (R;) and
sometimes it is used [ironically] to denote disapproval; also, as an exhortation to gentleness with
a thing, and to taking extraordinary pains; (TA;)
and in a case of expertness, or skilfulness: (AHei:)
it means نِعْمَ الرَّجُلُ and نِعْمَ الفِعْلُ [Excellent, or
most excellent, is the man! and, the deed!]; (Har
p. 142;) [or simply, excellent! or most excellent!
how good! how goodly! well done! bravo! and
the like;] or عَظُمَ الأَمْرُ and فَخُمَ [great in estimation is the thing, or affair, or event, or case!]:
(K:) MF observes, [probably from finding بَخَّ in
the place of بَخْ in his copy or copies of the K,] that
this explanation is like an express assertion that it
is a verb in the pret. tense, which requires consideration. (TA.) It is used alone; and in this
case you say, بَخْ, (K,) and بَخِ, (Msb, K,) with
kesr for its invariable termination, (Msb,) and
بَخٍ, and بَخٌ; (K, TA; [but in the CK, in the
place of بَخٍ and بَخٌ, we find بُخٌ;]) without tesh-deed, (T, Msb,) in most cases; (Msb;) but also
with teshdeed, (T, S, A,) like a noun; so that one
says, بَخٍ لَكَ and بَخٍّ [&c., meaning I say excel-lent! &c., to thee]: (S:). and one repeats it, (S,
A, K, &c.,) for the sake of emphasis; (S, A;)
saying, بَخْ بَخْ, (IAmb, S, A, K, &c.,) with the
خ quiescent like the ل in هَلْ and بَلْ, (IAmb,)
and بَخٍ بَخٍ, (S, A, R, K,) pronounced in the
latter manner, with tenween, when in connexion
with a following word, [and in this case only,
whereas it is pronounced in the former manner in
any case,] (S, A,) and بَخٍّ بَخٍّ, (S, * A, * R, K,)
and بَخٍ بَخْ, (K,) and بَخِّ بَخِّ. (R.)
جَمَلٌ بَخْبَاخُ الهَدِيرِ A camel that fills his mouth
with his شِقْشِقَة [or faucial bag] when he brays.
(S.)
إِبِلٌ مُبْخْبَخَةٌ Camels to which one says بَخْ بَخْ;
being pleased with them: (ISd, TA:) or largebellied camels; (K;) as also مُخَبْخَبَةٌ, which is
formed from the former by transposition; from
بَخْ بَخْ, or بَخٍ بَخْ, which is said by the Arabs in
praising a thing; as though, by reason of their
greatness, the people, seeing them, said, How
goodly are they! (TA.)
