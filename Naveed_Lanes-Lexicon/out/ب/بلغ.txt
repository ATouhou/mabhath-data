بُلُوغٌ [inf. n. of بَلَغَ] and إِبْلَاغٌ [inf. n. of
↓ ابلغ, but it seems that ابلاغ is here a mistranscription for بَلَاغٌ, which is, like بُلُوغٌ, an inf. n.
of بَلَغَ, and this observation will be found to be
confirmed by a statement immediately following
this sentence,] signify The reaching, attaining,
arriving at, or coming to, the utmost point of
that to which, or towards which, one tends or
repairs or betakes himself, to which one directs
his course, or which one seeks, pursues, endeavours
to reach, desires, intends, or purposes; whether
it be a place, or a time, or any affair or state
or event that is meditated or intended or determined or appointed: and sometimes, the being
at the point thereof: so says Abu-1-Kásim in the
Mufradát. (TA: [in which it is said, in the
supplement to the present art., that بَلَاغٌ signifies
The reaching, attaining, arriving at, or coming
to, a thing.]) You say, بَلَغَ المَكَانَ, (S, K,) and
المَنْزِلَ, (Msb,) [aor.
بَلُغَ,] inf. n. بُلُوغٌ (S, K) [and
بَلَاغٌ, as shown above], He reached, attained,
arrived at, or came to, (S, Msb, K,) the place,
(S, K,) and the place of abode: (Msb:) and (so in
the S, but in the K “ or,”) he was, or became,
at the point of reaching it, attaining it, &c. (S,
K.) فَبَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَ, in the Kur [ii. 232], means
And they have fully attained, or ended, their
term. (Msb.) But فَإِذَا بَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ, in the same
[lxv. 2], means And when they are near to attaining, or ending, their term: (S, TA:) or are
at the point of accomplishing their term. (Msb,
TA.) It has the first of the meanings explained
above in the phrase, بَلَغَ أَشُدَّهُ [Kur xii. 22 &c.,
He attained his manly vigour, or full maturity,
&c.]. (TA.) And in بَلَغَأَرْبَعِينَ سَنَةً [Kur xlvii. 14,
He attained the age of forty years]. (TA.) And
in بَلَغَ مَعَهُ السَّعْىَ [Kur xxxvii. 100, He attained
to working with him]. (TA.) In the Kur [iii. 35],
occurs the phrase, وَقَدْ بَلَغَنِىَ الكِبَرُ [When old age
hath come to me, or overtaken me]: and in another
place [xix. 9], وَ قَدْ بَلَغْتُ مِنَ الكِبَرِ عُتِيًّا [And I
have reached the extreme degree of old age: so
explained in the Expos. of the Jel]: phrases like
أَدْرَكَنِىَ الجَهْدُ and أَدْرَكْتُهُ. (Er-Rághib, TA.)
You say also, مَا بَلَغَ ↓ لَزِمَهُ ذٰلِكَ بَالِغًا with the
accus. case as a denotative of state; meaning
[That clave to him, or adhered to him, &c.,]
rising to its highest degree or point; from بَلَغَ
المَنْزِلَ, explained above. (Msb.) [But مَا بَلَغَ ↓ بَالِغًا
more frequently means Whatever point, degree,
amount, sum, quantity, number, or the like, it
may reach, attain, arrive at, come to, or amount
to.] And ↓ بَلَغَ فُلَانٌ مَبْلَغَهُ and ↓ مَبْلَغَتُهُ [Such
a one reached, or attained, his utmost point or
scope or degree]. (TA.) And ↓ بَلَغَ فِى العِلْمِ المَبَالِغَ
[He attained, in knowledge, or science, the utmost
degrees of proficiency]. (TA.) And بَلَغَ فِى

(O, TA.) And بَلَغَ غَايَتَهُ فِى الطَّلَبِ [He did his
utmost, or used his utmost power or ability, in
seeking to attain an object]. (Msb in art. جهد.)

the utmost endeavour, or effort, or power, or
strength, of his camel, in journeying]. (S in art.
نكث.) And بَلَغَ جَهْدَ دَابَّتِهِ i. q. جَهَدَهَا [He jaded,
harassed, distressed, fatigued, or wearied, his beast]:
(K in art. جهد:) and in like manner, بَلَغَ مَشَقَّتَهُ
and بَلَغَ مِنْهُ المَشَقَّةَ i. q. جَهَدَهُ [and شَقَّ عَلَيْهِ, i. e.
He, or it, jaded him, harassed him, &c.; ditressed him, afflicted him, oppressed him, overpowered him: thus in each of these instances, as
in many similar cases, the verb with the inf. n.
that follows is equivalent to the verb of that
inf. n.]. (Msb in art. جهد.) [And, elliptically,
بَلَغَ مِنْهُ i. q. بَلَغَ مِنْهُ المشَقَّةَ , explained above:
and often meaning It took, or had, an effect upon
him; it affected him: frequently said of wine and
the like: and of a saying; as in the Ksh and
Bd in iv. 66, where يَبْلُغُ مِنْهُمْ is followed by
وَيُؤَثِرُ فِيهِ as an explicative: see also بَلِيغٌ.] And
بَلَغْتَ مِنَّا البُلَغِينَ, (S, K,) and البِلَغِينَ, and كُلَّ
مَبْلَغٍ: (K:) see البُلَغِينَ below. And بَلَغْتُ مِنَ
الأَمْرِ المَشَقَّةَ [I experienced distress from the
affair, or event]. (TA in art. مض.) [See also
an ex. voce إِبِدٌ. بَلَغَنِى also signifies It has come
to my knowledge, or been related to me, or been
told me; or it came to my knowledge, &c.: and
in this case it is generally followed by أَنَّ, or by
أَنْ as a contraction of أَنَّ: for exs., see these two
particles. And in like manner, بَلَغَنِى عَنْهُ Information has come to me, or information came to me,
from him, or concerning him, that such a thing has
happened, or had happened.] And بَلَغَ said of a
letter or writing, inf. n. بَلَاغٌ and بُلُوغٌ, It reached,
arrived, or came. (Msb.) And said of a plant,
or of herbage, It attained its full growth: (TA:)
and of a tree, such as a palm-tree &c., its fruit
became ripe: (AHn, TA:) and of fruit, it became
ripe. (Msb.) Also, said of a boy, (T, S, M, &c.,)
aor.
بَلُغَ, inf. n. بُلُوغٌ, or, as IKoot says, بَلَاغٌ,
(Msb,) He attained to puberty, virility, ripeness,
or maturity; syn. أَدْرَكَ, (T, S, Msb, K,) and
اِحْتَلَمَ; (M, Msb;) and attained a consummate
degree of goodliness (بَلَغَ مِنَ الجَوْدَةِ مَبْلَغًا): (O,
TA:) as though he attained the time of the writing
of his marriage-contract, and of his having duties
or obligations imposed upon him: (TA:) and
in like manner one says of a girl, بَلَغَ, (T, TA,)
or بَلَغَتْ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  بَلَغَ اللّٰهُ بِهِ [God caused him
to reach, attain, arrive at, or come to, his appointed
end, or term of life; أَجَلَهُ, or the like, being understood]. (TA.) You say, بَلَغَ اللّٰهُ بِكَ أَكْلَأَ العُمُرِ,
i. e. [May God cause thee to reach, or attain,]
the extreme, or most distant, period of life! (S
and TA in art. كلأ.) And فَعَلْتُ بِهِ مَا بَلَغَ بِهِ
الأَذَى وَ المَكْرُوهْ [I did with him that which caused
him to come to what was annoying, or hurtful, and
evil]. (TA.) And بَلَغَ بِهِ البِلَغِينَ: see the last word
of this phrase below. ―
-b3-  بُلِغَ, like عُنِىَ, He (a
man) was, or became, jaded, harasssed, distressed,
fatigued, or wearied. (K.)
-A2-  بَلُغَ, [aor.
بَلُغَ,] (S,
Msb, K,) inf. n. بَلَاغَةٌ, (S, Msb,) He was, or
became بَلِيغ, i. e. فَصِيح [more properly signifying chaste, or perspicuous, in speech, but here
meaning eloquent]; (S, * Msb, K;) and sharp,
or penetrating, or effective, in tongue; (Msb;)
attaining, by his speech, or diction, the utmost
scope of his mind and desire. (K, * TA.) The
difference between بَلَاغَةٌ and فَصَاحَةٌ is this: that
the latter is an attribute of a single word and of
speech and of the speaker; but the former is an
attribute only of speech and the speaker: (Kull:)
بلاغة in the speaker is A faculty whereby one is
enabled to compose language suitable to the exigency of the case, i. e., to the occasion of speaking
[or writing], with chasteness, or perspicuity, or
eloquence, thereof: in language, it is suitableness
to the exigency of the case, i. e., to the occasion
of speaking [or writing], with chasteness or perspicuity, or eloquence, thereof. (KT.)
2
تَبْلِيغٌ and ↓ إِبْلَاغٌ [inf. ns. of بلّغ and ابلغ]
signify The causing to reach, attain, arrive, or
come; bringing, conveying, or delivering: (S, K,
TA:) the former is the more common. (Er-Rághib, TA.) [You say, بلّغهُ المَكَانَ He caused
him, or it, to reach, attain, arrive at, or come to,
the place. And بلّغهُ مَقْصُودَهُ He caused him to
attain his object of aim or endeavour &c.] And
بَلَّغْتُ الرِّسَالَةَ [I brought, conveyed, or delivered,
the message]. (S.) And بلّغهُ السَّلَامَ, (Msb,) and
الخَبَرَ, (TA,) as also ↓ ابلغهُ, (Msb, TA,) He
brought, conveyed, delivered, or communicated, to
him the salutation, (Msb,) and he brought, &c., or
told, to him the news, or information. (TA.) [And
بَلَّغَنِى عَنْ فُلَانٍ He told me from such a one, or
on the part of such a one, some piece of information, or that some event had happened, &c.]
-A2-
بلّغ الفَارِسُ, (S, A, K,) inf. n. تَبْلِيغٌ, (K,) The
horseman stretched forth, or extended, his hand,
or arm, with the rein of his horse, [or gave the

-A3-  بلّغ الشَّيْبُ فِى رَأْسِهِ
Hoariness began to appear on his head; accord.
to IAar; as also بلّع, with the unpointed ع: the
Basrees assert that the former is a mistranscription; but it is related as heard from Th, by Aboo-Bekr Es-Soolee. (TA.)
3
بالغ, (S, Msb, K, &c.,) inf. n. مُبَالَغَةٌ (JK,
K, &c.) and بِلَاغٌ, (K.) He exceeded the usual,
or ordinary, or the just, or proper, bounds, or
degree, in a thing; acted egregiously, or immoderately, or extravagantly, therein: (KL:) he
strove, or laboured; exerted himself, or his power
or efforts or endeavours or ability; employed
himself vigorously, strenuously, laboriously, sedulously, earnestly, with energy or effectiveness;
took pains, or extraordinary pains: (K, TA:)
he did not fall short of doing what was requisite,
or what he ought; did not flag, or was not
remiss: (S, K, TA:) he exerted unsparingly his
power or ability, or effort or endeavour, or the
utmost thereof: (Msb:) he accomplished, or did,
or attained, the utmost of his power or ability, or
effort or endeavour; he did his utmost: (JK:)
فِى أَمْرٍ [in an affair]: (S, K, TA:) or فِى كَذَا,
meaning in the pursuit of such a thing. (Msb.)
[
بالغ فِى كَذَا may be rendered as above, or He
did such a thing much, exceedingly, egregiously,
extraordinarily, immoderately, extravagantly,
excessively, vehemently, energetically, superlatively, excellently, consummately, thoroughly.
Hence مُبَالَغَةٌ in explanations of words; meaning
Intensiveness; muchness; extraordinariness; excessiveness; vehemence; energy; emphasis; hyperbole; &c.; and sometimes, frequentative signification. Thus, إِسْمُ مُبَالَغَةٍ means A noun of
intensiveness; or an intensive epithet: as شَكُورٌ
“ very thankful,” or “ very grateful; ” and حَمَّادٌ
“ a great praiser,” or “ a frequent praiser. ”]

performance, or accomplishment, of the affair].
(TA.) And أَبْلَغْتُ إِلَيْهِ i. e. فَعَلْتُ بِهِ مَا بَلَغَ بِهِ

-A2-  See also 1, first sentence;
where it is said that إِبْلَاغٌ is syn. with بُلُوغٌ; but

(بَلَاغَة) in his speech, not being of those characterized thereby: [whence] one says, مَا هُوَ بِبَلِيغٍ

S, K,) and ↓ سَمْعًا لَا بَلْغًا, (Ks, S, K,) and سِمْعًا لَا
بِلْغًا, (K,) O God, may we hear of it (or may it
be heard of, IB) but may it not be fulfilled; (Fr,
S, K;) or, may it not reach us, or come to us:
said on hearing of a displeasing, or hateful, or an

بُلْغَةٌ A sufficiency of the means of subsistence,
(T, S, Msb, K,) such that nothing remains over

enough; (JK, Msb, TA;) as also ↓ بَلَاغٌ, (JK, S,
Msb, K,) meaning a thing that suffices, or contents, and enables one to attain what he seeks;
(TA;) and ↓ تَبَلُّغٌ. (JK, Msb, TA.) You say,
فِى هٰذَا بُلْغَةٌ, and ↓ بَلَاغٌ, and ↓ تَبَلُّغٌ, In this is a
sufficiency, or enough. (Msb, TA.) And it is
said in the Kur [xxi. 106], لِقَوْمٍ ↓ إِنَّ فِى هٰذَا لَبَلَاغًا
عَابِدِينَ Verily in this is a sufficiency [for a people
serving God]: (Bd, TA:) or a means of attaining

بِلَغْنٌ: see بَلَاغَةٌ.
-A2-  Also A calumniator, or

discourse to others. (TA.)
البُلَغِينَ, (S,) or البِلَغِينَ, (JK,) or both, (K,)
Calamity, misfortune, or disaster: (S, K:) or
distress, or affliction. (JK.) Hence the saying
of 'Áïsheh to 'Alee, (S, K,) when she was taken

and البِلَغِينَ, (K,) i. e., الدَّاهِيَةَ; meaning بَلَغْتَ
↓ مِنَّا كُلَّ مَبْلَغٍ [Thou hast distressed us, or afflicted
us, in the utmost degree]: (K:) it is said to mean
that the war harassed her, and distressed her in
the utmost degree. (TA.) It is like البُرَحِينَ
[and البِرَحِينَ] and الأَطْوَرِينَ; all meaning calamities, misfortunes, or disasters: (A'Obeyd, TA:)
and is as though they said خَطْبٌ بِلَغٌ [and بُلَغٌ],
meaning بَلِيغٌ, and then formed the pl. thus because they considered calamities [as personified,
i. e.,] as rational beings having purpose, or design.
(IAth, TA.) It is invariably thus, terminating
with ى and ن: or one may say in the nom. case
البُلَغُونَ, and in the accus. and gen. البُلَغِينَ. (O,
K. *) You say also, بَلَغَ بِهِ البِلَغِينَ [lit. He caused
him to come, i. e. he brought him, to calamity,
misfortune, or disaster, or to distress, or affliction]; meaning he went to the utmost point in
reviling him, and annoying him, or molesting him.
(IAar, TA.)

announced, (مَا بَلَغَ,) of the Kur-án and of the

the meaning is, مِنْ ذَوِى البَلَاغِ, i. e., التَّبْلِيغِ, [of
those who have the office of communicating, or
announcing,] the simple subst. being put in the
place of the inf. n.: (K, TA:) but some relate it
differently, saying ↓ مِنَ البُلَّاغِ [of the communicators, or announcers,] like حُدَّاث in the sense of
مُحَدِّثُون: (TA:) and some say, ↓ مِنَ البِلَاغِ,
meaning مِنَ المُبَالِغِينَ فِى التَّبْلِيغِ, i. e. of those
who do their utmost in communicating, or announcing. (Hr, K.) [See this trad. cited and

reaching, or arriving at, its appointed place].
(K, TA.) And ↓ أَمْرُ اللّٰهِ بَلْغٌ, i. e. بَالِغٌ, (S, K,)

in the Kur [lxv. 3], إِنَّ اللّٰهَ بَالِغٌ أَمْرَهُ (S) Verily
God attaineth his purpose. (Bd, Jel.) And

is also thus applied, with the mention of the noun
which it qualifies, (T, Msb, K,) not being wrong
because it is the original form; (T, TA;) and
