بأس1
بَؤُسَ, aor. يَبْؤُسُ, (S, M, Msb, K,) inf. n.
بَأْسٌ, (S, Msb, K,) or بَأْسَةٌ; (M; [so I find in a
copy of the M, but perhaps it is a mistranscription
for بَآسَةٌ;]) and بَئِسَ, [aor. يَبْأَسُ,] inf. n. بَأْسٌ;
(M;) He was, or became, mighty, or strong, in
war or fight; (K;) courageous, or valiant: (M,
Msb, K:) or very mighty or strong in war or
fight. (AZ, S.)
-A2-  بَئْسُ, (S, M, Msb, K,) aor.
يَبْأَسُ (S, M, K) and يَبْئِسُ, the latter extr., like
يَنْعِمُ aor. of نَعِمَ, (M,) [and some other instances,
(see حَسِبَ,)] inf. n. بُؤْسٌ (S, Msb, * K) and بُؤُوسٌ
and بُؤْسَى (K) and بَأْسٌ (TA) and بَئيسٌ, (S, K,)
[in measure] like أَمِيرٌ, (TA,) [accord. to the CK
بِئْسٌ, which is a mistake,] and بَئِيسَى, (TS, TA,)
incorrectly written in the copies of the K بِئْسَي;
(TA;) or بَؤُسَ; (A;) or both these forms; (M;) He
was, or became, in a state of distress; straitened in
his means of subsistence, or in the conveniences of
life; (M, Msb;) in a state of poverty: (M, A, Msb, *
TA:) or in a state of pressing want: (S, K, TA:)
and بَؤُسَ, inf. n. بَآسَةٌ and بَئِيسٌ, whence the subst.
بَؤْسَى, he was, or became, in a state of trial, or
affliction: (M:) and [in like manner,] ↓ أَبْأَسَ,
(inf. n. إِبْآسٌ,S,) distress, or poverty, or misfortune, or calamity, (البَأْسَآءُ,) befell him. (IAar, S, *
M, TA.)
-A3-  بِئْسَ, also written بَئِسَ and بِئِسَ and
بَأْسَ, (S, K,) is a word of dispraise or blame, (S,)
implying all kinds of dispraise or blame, (TA,)
[or superlative dispraise or blame; signifying,
Very evil or bad is he, or it: or superlatively
evil or bad is he, or it:] contr. of نِعمَ: (S, M,
TA:) a pret. verb, imperfectly inflected, (S, K,)
like نِعْمَ, (S,) [having only one variation of form,
namely, the fem. بِئْسَتْ, though the masc. is more
commonly used even when the agent is fem. or
pl.,] because it is translated from its original
application, (S, K,) i. e. from بَئِسَ فُلَانٌ signifying
أَصَابَ بُؤْسًا [he found, met with, or experienced,
distress, &c.], to signify dispraise or blame. (S,
TA.) When it is accompanied by a gen. n. without the article ال, this is always in the accus.
case: but when the n. has the article ال, it is
always in the nom. case: (TA:) you say, بِئْسَ
رَجُلًا زَيْدً [Very evil or bad, or superlatively evil
or bad, as a man, is Zeyd; رجلا being a specificative]: (K:) and بِئْسَ الرَّجُلُ زَيْدٌ [Very evil,
&c., is the man, Zeyd]; and بِئْسَتِ المَرْأَةُ هِنْدٌ [or
more commonly بِئْسَ العَيْرُ in this case also, Very evil,
&c., is the woman, Hind]. (S.) Some argue
that it is a noun, from the saying, نِعْمَ السَّيْرُ عَلَى
بِئْسَ العَيْرُ, because it has a prep.; but this is
explained as elliptical, and meaning, نِعَمَ السَّيْرُ
عَلَى عَيْرٍ مَقُولٍ فِيهِ بِئْسَ العيْرُ [Excellent is the
journeying upon an ass of which it is said Very
evil, &c., is the ass]. (I 'Ak p. 232.) Zj says that
when it is followed by مَا, then مَا, with it, is
regarded as occupying the place of an indeterminate noun; [namely, شَيْئًا, as a specificative; as
in the Kur ii. 84,بِئْسَ مَا اشْتَرَوا بِهِ أَنْفُسَهُمْ, or بِئْسَمَا,
&c., Very evil, &c., as a thing, is that for which
they have sold, or exchanged, themselves:] (TA:)
but some say that it is the agent, and is a determinate noun; and this is the opinion of Ibn-Kharoof, which he ascribes to Sb. (I 'Ak ubi
suprà.) [For further illustration, see نِعْمَ.]

أَبْاَ^َ see بَئِسَ
5
تَبَاَّ^َ see 6.
6
تَبَآءَسَ He feigned the lowliness, or submissiveness, of poverty, humbling, or abasing, himself,
(K,* TA,) with men; and ↓ تَبَأَّسَ is allowable in
the same sense. (TA.)
8
ابتأس بِهِ, (M, A,) and مِنْهُ, (S, TA,) He
was distressed by it, or at it; it does not signify
dislike: (IB, TA:) or he grieved at it, (S, M,
A,) and humbled and abased himself: so in the
Kur xi. 38 and xii. 69. (M, A, TA.) It is said
of a man when a thing that he dislikes becomes
known to him. (AZ, TA.)
بَأْسٌ Might, or strength, (S, A, Msb, K,) in
war or fight: (S, A, K:) courage; valour, or
valiantness; prowess. (M, K.) ―
-b2-  War, or fight;
(M, Msb;) as also ↓ بَئِيْسٌ (M) and ↓ بَأْسَآءُ:
(TA:) pl. of the first,أَبْؤَسٌ. (Msb.) ―
-b3-  Hence,
(M,) (assumed tropical:)  Fear, (M, TA,) in the saying, لَا بأْسَ
عَلَيْكَ, (M, TA, *) and بِكَ, (M,) [(assumed tropical:)  There is no
fear for thee: lit., there is no war against thee,
or with thee]: the saying of which to an enemy
implies the granting him security, or protection:
and in the same sense it is used in a trad.,
in the phrase اِشْتَدَّ البَأْسُ [(assumed tropical:)  Fear became vehement]. (TA.) ―
-b4-  I. q. ضَرَرٌ (assumed tropical:)  [Harm, injury,
&c.]: so in the phrase لَا بَأْسَ [There is, or will
be, no harm, &c.; and لَا بَأْسَ بِكَذَا, and فِى كَذَا,
(assumed tropical:)  There is, or will be, no harm in such a thing].
(Har p. 311.) It is said in a trad., لَا بَأْسَ بِالْغِنَي
لِمَنِ اتَّقَي [There is no harm in wealth to him
who is pious]. (El-Jámi' es-Sagheer of Es-Suyootee.) بَاس also occurs for بَأْس; the being
suppressed, agreeably with analogy; not altered
by permutation. (M, TA.) ―
-b5-  Punishment: (S,
A, K:) or severe punishment; (TA;) as also
↓ بَئِسٌ, in measure like كَتِفٌ. (IAar, TA.) ―
-b6-
See also بُؤْسٌ, in two places.
بُؤْسٌ (also written بُوسٌ, with the suppressed,
Msb) Distress; straitness of the means of subsistence, or of the conveniences of life; poverty:
(M, Msb,* TA:*) or a state of pressing want:
(S, K:) or misfortune; calamity: (A:) and
↓ بُؤُوسٌ and ↓ بُؤْسَى (K, TA) and ↓ بَأْسَآءُ (M, A)
and ↓ بَأْسٌ (TA) and ↓ بَئِيسٌ (S, K) and ↓ بَئِيسَى
(TA) and ↓ مَبْأَسَةٌ (M, TA) [all of which, except
↓ بَأْسَآءُ and ↓ مَبْأَسَةٌ, are said to be inf. ns. (see
بَئِسَ)] signify the same as بُؤْسٌ: (S, M, A, K,
TA:) ↓ بُؤْسَى and ↓ بَأْسَآءُ are both from بُؤْسٌ
[with which they are syn. accord. to authorities
indicated above]; (Zj, IDrd, TA;) the former is
contr. of نُعْمَى, (S, TA,) and in like manner the
latter is contr. of نَعْمَآءُ: (TA:) the latter is of
the measure فَعْلَآءُ without any أَفْعَلُ, because it
is a subst.; like as أَفْعَلُ occurs among substs.
without any فَعَلَآءُ, as in the instance of أَحْمَدُ:
(Akh, S:) or ↓ بُؤْسَى signifies a state of trial
or affliction, and is a subst.; and ↓ بَئِيسٌ and
↓ بَآسَةٌ signify the same, but are inf. ns.: (M:) and
↓ بَأْسَآءُ is syn. with شِدَّةٌ [like بُؤْسٌ in the first of
the senses explained above]; (S, TA;) and مَشَقَّةٌ
[meaning distress, or difficulty]: (TA:) or it
signifies misfortune, or calamity, (A, K,) like
بُؤْسٌ; (A;) and so أَبْؤُسٌ: (S, K:) or rather this
last signifies misfortunes, or calamities; for it
is pl. of ↓ بَأْسٌ, i. e., a pl. of pauc.; not of بُؤْسٌ,
as J asserts it to be; for the pl. of pauc. of بُؤْسٌ
is أَبْآسٌ: (IB, TA:) but أَبْؤُسٌ may be used as
pl. of ↓ بَأْسَآءُ. (Fr, in S, voce ضَرَّآءُ, q. v.) [See
exs. of these two pls. in what follows.] You say
يَوْمُ بُؤْسٍ وَيَوْمُ نُعْمٍ [A day of distress, or poverty,
&c., and a day of ease and plenty]. (S, TA.)
And بُؤْسًا لَهُ [May distress, or poverty, &c., befall
him]: a form of imprecation. (Sb, M, TA.) And
بُؤْسَ ابْنِ سُمَيَّةَ, app. an expression of pity [meaning Alas for the distress, &c., of Ibn-Sumeiyeh!].
(TA, from a trad.) And عَسَىَ الغُوَيْرُ أَبْؤُسًا Perhaps the little cave [may be attended with] calamities; not calamity, as in the S [and K]: (IB:)
a prov.; (S;) originating from a cave's having
collapsed upon some men in it; or from an
enemy's having come to some men in a cave,
and slain them; wherefore it is applied to anything whence evil is feared: (As, S, K, in art.
غور:) or it is applied to him who is suspected
of a thing: (IAar, TA:) or الغُوَيْرُ was the name
of a certain water, which belonged to the tribe
of Kelb, and the words of this prov. were said
by Ez-Zebbà, when Kaseer turned aside from
the plain road, and took the way to الغُوَيْرُ: (Ibn-El-Kelbee, S, K, in art. غور:)ابؤسا is in the
accus. case by reason of يَكُونُ understood. (Mughnee.) [See Freytag's Arab. Prov. ii. 94.] ElKumeyt also says,
قَالُوا أَسَآءَ بَنُو كُرْزٍ فَقُلْتُ لَهُمْ
عَسَى الغُوَيْرُ بِأَبْآسٍ وَأغْوَارِ
[They said, Benoo-Kurz have done evil: and
I said to them, Perhaps the little cave may be
attended with calamities and connected with
other caves]: أَبْآس is here pl. of بُؤْس. (IB,
TA.) [In the S, the last words are written
بِإِبْآسٍ وَإِعْوَارٍ, in one copy: in another, وإِغْوَارِ:
both of which are app. wrong.] ―
