بمبَمٌّ [The bass in music; used in this sense in
the present day: or particularly the bass notes
of the lute: in this sense F seems to have understood the saying of ISd that] the بَمّ of the lute
is well known: (M, K: [in the CK, البَمَّ مِنَ
العُوْدِ او الوَتَرِ الخ is erroneously put for البَمُّ مِنَ
العُودِ م أَوِ الوَتَرُ الخ:]) or (so in the K) it is the
thick [or bass] chord of the lute: (S, K:) the
word is foreign: (M:) [in Persian بَمْ:] Az says
that it is not Arabic. (TA.)
بُمٌّ i. q. بُومٌ, q. v. (K.)
