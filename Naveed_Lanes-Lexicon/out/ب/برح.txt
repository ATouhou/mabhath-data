برح1
بَرِحَ is syn. with زَالَ [in two senses; i. e.
as an attributive verb, and also as a non-attributive verb; as will be shown by what follows].
(S, A, Mgh.) [Using it as an attributive verb,]
you say, لَا أَبْرَحُ حَتَّى تَقْضِىَ حَاجَتِى I will not
go away, or depart, or withdraw, (لَا أَزُولٌ, and
لَا أَتَنَحَّىِ,) until thou accomplish my want: from
بَرِحَ المَكَانُ, inf. n. بَرَاحٌ, he went away, or departed, from the place; syn. زَالَ مِنْهُ: and to be
distinguished from the phrase in the Kur [xviii. 59,
similar as to words,] mentioned below. (Mgh.)
You say, بَرِحَ مَكَانَهُ, (S, A, L, K,) aor.
بَرَحَ, (K,)
inf. n. بَرَاحٌ (S, L, K) and بُرُوحٌ (L, TA, and
Ham p. 250) and بَرَحٌ, (L,) or بَرْحٌ, (as in a copy
of the TA,) He went away, or departed, from
his place; (S, L, K, and Ham ubi suprà;) and
he became in the بَرَاح [or wide, uncultivated, or
uninhabited, tract]. (S, L, K.) And مَا بَرِحَ مَكَانَهُ
He did not quit his place. (Msb.) And بَرِحَ
[alone], aor.
بَرَحَ, inf. n. بَرَاحٌ, It (a thing) went
away, or departed, (زَالَ,) from its place; (Msb;)
as also ↓ تبرّح. (L.) In the phrase لَا بَرَاحَ [There
is, or shall be, no quitting of place, or going
away, or departing], the noun is in the accus.
case, as in لَا رَيْبَ: but it is allowable to put
it in the nom. case, so that لا is used in the
manner of لَيْسَ; (S, K;) as in the following
saying of Saad Ibn-Málik, [in the TA, in one
place, Ibn-Náshib,] in a poem of which the rhyme
is with refa, (S, IAth,) alluding to El-Hárith
Ibn-'Abbád, who had withdrawn himself from
the war of Teghlib and Bekr the sons of Wáïl:
(IAth, TA:)
فَأَنَا ابْنُ قَيْسٍ لَا بَرَاحُ مَنْ فَرَّعَنْ نِيرَانِهَا
[Whoso fleeth from its fires, (i. e. نِيرَانِ الحَرْبِ
the fires of the war,) let him do so: but as for
me, I am the son of Keys: to me there is not,
or shall not be, any quitting of place]. (S, IAth.
[See also Ham p. 250, where, for مَن فَرَّ, we find
مَنْ صَدَّ whoso turneth away.]) [Hence,] بَرِحَتِ
الرِّيحُ بِالتُّرَابِ The wind carried up, raised, or
swept up and scattered, [lit. went away with,]
the dust. (Msb.) [Hence also, accord. to some,]
بَرِحَ الخَفَآءُ, (T, S, K, &c.,) and بَرَحَ, (Ibn-ElLihyánee, Z, and TA, [thus written in a copy of
the A,]) (tropical:)  The state of concealment departed, or
ceased: or (tropical:)  what was in a state of concealment
became apparent; from بَرَاحٌ meaning “what is
open and apparent” of land: or (tropical:)  what I was
concealing became apparent: (T, TA:) or (tropical:)  the
affair, or case, became manifest, (S, A, K,) and
its concealment ceased, (A,) [or] as though the
secret departed, and ceased: (S:) or, as some
say, (assumed tropical:)  the secret became apparent: (TA in art.
خفى:) or, lit., the low ground became high and
apparent; meaning (assumed tropical:)  what was concealed became
revealed: (Har pp. 133—4:) the first who said
it was Shikk the Diviner. (IDrd, TA.) ―
-b2-  [Using
it as a non-attributive verb,] you say, لَا أَبْرَحُ
أَفْعَلُ ذٰلِكَ I will not cease, or I will continue,
(لَا أَزَالُ,) to do that: (S, A: *) and مَا بَرِحَ يَفْعَلُ
كَذَا [he ceased not to do thus; or] he persevered
in, or kept to, doing thus: (Msb:) and مَا بَرِحَ
زَيْدٌ قَائِمًا [Zeyd ceased not to be, or he kept, or
continued, standing]: in this case, the verb is of
the category of كَانَ; (Mgh;) relates to time;
and requires a predicate: and its inf. n. is بَرَاحٌ.
(Ham p. 250.) Hence the saying in the Kur
[xviii. 59], لَا أَبْرَاحُ حَتَّى أَبْلُغَ مَجْمَعَ البَحْرَيْنِ, but
the predicate is suppressed: it may be مَا نَحْنُ
فِيهِ كَذٰلِكَ [i. e. I will not cease in that wherein
we are thus engaged until I reach the place of meeting of the two seas]: (Mgh:) or it means لَا أَزَالُ
أَسِيرُ [I will not cease journeying]: (Bd, Jel:) or
لا ابرح here may mean I will not depart (لَا أَزُولُ)
from that upon which I am intent, namely
journeying and seeking; and I will not relinquish it; so that it does not require the predicate.
(Bd. [He gives a third explanation, paraphrastic
and strained, which I omit.])
-A2-  بَرَحَ, (S, K,)
aor.
بَرَحَ, (L, TA, [but it is implied in the K that
it is
بَرُحَ, which is contr. to rule,]) inf. n. بُرُوحٌ,
It (a gazelle, S, K, and a bird, and any wild
animal, that is hunted or shot, TA) turned its
left side towards the spectator, passing by (S, K *)
from the direction of his right hand towards
that of his left hand: (S:) or passed by from
the direction of the spectator's left hand towards
that of his right hand: (Aboo-'Amr Esh-Sheybánee, IF, L, Msb, in art. سنح:) [the former
appears to be accord. to the usage of the Hijázees;
and the latter, accord. to that of the Nejdees, in
general: see بَارِحٌ:] contr. of سَنَحَ. (S.)
-A3-
بَرَحَ, aor.
بَرُحَ, [contr. to rule,] (K,) inf. n. بَرْحٌ,
(TA,) He was angry. (K.) When a man has
been angry with his companion, one says, مَا أَشَدَّ
مَا بَرَحَ عَلَيْهِ [How violently angry was he with
him!]. (L.)
2
بَرَّحَتْ بِيَ الحُمَّى The fever affected me
with its severity, violence, or sharpness, termed
بُرَحَآءُ. (TA.) ―
-b2-  Hence, (TA,) from بُرَحَآءُ, (S,
K,) برّح بِهِ, inf. n. تَبْرِيحٌ, It (an affair, an event,
or a case,) affected him severely; afflicted, distressed, or harassed, him: (S, K:) said also of
anxiety; or disquietude, or trouble, of mind:
(A:) and of a beating, meaning it hurt him
severely, or greatly. (Msb.) Also said of a man,
meaning He importuned him, or pressed him,
with annoyance, or molestation: (A, TA:) he
annoyed him, or molested him, by importuning
or pressing; as also ↓ ابرح: (TA:) he annoyed
him, or molested him, by distressing importunity
or pressing: (T, TA:) and he punished, tormented, or tortured, him. (TA.) تَبْرِيحٌ signifies
The act of annoying, molesting, or hurting:
(Mgh:) and in a trad., (in which it is forbidden,
TA,) the killing, or putting to death, in an evil
[or a cruel] manner; such as throwing live fish,
and lice, into the fire. (Mgh, TA.)
-A2-  بَرَّحَ اللّٰهُ
عَنْكَ May God remove from thee البَرْح [i. e.
difficulty, distress, affliction, &c., or the difficulty,
&c.]. (A, TA.)
4
ابرحهُ He made him, or caused him, to go
away from, depart from, or quit, his place.
(A, * L.)
-A2-  He, or it, pleased, or rejoiced, him;
excited his admiration and approval; induced
in him wonder, or admiration, and pleasure, or
joy. (S, K.) One says also, مَا أَبْرَحَ هٰذَا الأَمْرَ
How greatly does this affair, or event, please,
or rejoice! how greatly does it excite admiration
and approval! or how greatly does it induce
wonder, or admiration, and pleasure, or joy!
(S.) ―
-b2-  He treated him with honour, or honoured
him, and magnified him: (S, K:) or, as some
say, he found him to be generous, or noble. (TA.)
―
-b3-  He judged him, or it, i. e. a man, (A, TA,)
and a horse, (A,) or anything, (TA,) to be excellent, or to excel, (A, TA,) and wondered at, or
admired, him, or it. (A.)
-A3-  ابرح also signifies
He exceeded the usual bounds, degree, or mode.
(As, S, * TA.) You say, أَبْرَحْتَ كَرَمًا, and لُؤْمًا,
(A, TA,) Thou hast done a thing exceeding the
usual bounds [in generosity, or nobleness, and in
meanness, or ignobleness]; or extravagant; or
excessive. (TA.) ―

تَبَرَّحَ see 1.
بَرْحٌ Difficulty, distress, affliction, or adversity;
evil, or mischief; (K, TA;) annoyance, molestation, or hurt; severe punishment; trouble, inconvenience, or fatigue; (TA;) a difficult, a distressing, an afflictive, or adverse, and a wonderful, thing or event: (Ham p. 135:) and annoyance, or molestation, by distressing importunity
or pressing; a subst. from 2: (T, TA:) and
بِنْتُ بَرْحٍ, [and app. اِبْنُ بَرْحٍ also,] a calamity,
misfortune, or disaster; or a great, or terrible,
thing, affair, or case; (TA;) as also ↓ بِنْتُ بَارِحٍ,
and ↓ اِبْنُ بَرِيحٍ; (K;) pl. بَنَاتُ بَرْحٍ and بَنُو بَرْحٍ.
(TA.) [See also تَبْرِيحٌ.] You say, لَقِيتُ مِنْهُ بَرْحًا
↓ بَارِحًا I experienced from him, or it, [great]
difficulty, distress, affliction, or adversity; [great]
annoyance, molestation, or hurt; (S, A, * K; *)
a phrase having an intensive signification, (K,
TA,) like لَيْلٌ أَلْيَلُ [and لَيْلٌ لَائِلٌ]; and so بَرْحًا
↓ مُبَرِّحًا. (TA.) When used as an imprecation,
the more approved way is to put the two words
in the accus. case: but sometimes they are put
in the nom. case; as in the saying of a poet,
↓ بَرْحٌ لَعيْنَكَ بَارِحٌ [May great difficulty, &c.,
befall thy two eyes!]. (TA.) You say also,
لَقِيتُ مِنْهُ بَنَاتِ بَرْحٍ, (S, A,) and بَنِي بَرْحٍ, (S,)
I experienced from him, or it, difficulties, distresses, afflictions, or adverse events; and calamities, misfortunes, or disasters: (S:) and, in
the same sense, ↓ لقيت منه البِرَحِينَ, and ↓ البُرَحِينَ,
(S, K,) and ↓ البَرَحِينَ; (K;) or, accord. to some
copies of the K, ↓ البِرْحَينِ, and ↓ البُرْحَيْنِ, and
↓ البَرْحَيْنِ, as duals; but the former reading is
the more correct: (TA:) [MF disapproves of
the form بَرَحِينَ, and it is not mentioned in the
L; but the dual form بَرْحَيْنِ is there mentioned:]
it seems as though the sing. of بَرِحِينَ [or بُرَحِينَ]
were بِرَحَةٌ [or بُرَحَةٌ], and that the pl. is formed
by the termination ون to compensate for the
rejection of the ة, as is virtually the case in
أَرَضُونَ; [or because the signification is regarded
as that of a personification;] and that the pl.
only is used. (L.) It is said in a prov., بِنْتُ
بَرْحٍ شَرَكٌ عَلَى رَأْسِكَ [Calamity is, or be, a snare
upon thy head]. (TA.)
بَرِحٌ: see مُبَرِّحٌ.
صَرْحَةَ بَرْحَةَ, or صَرْحَةً بَرْحَةً, &c.: see art. صرح.
بُرْحَةٌ The best of anything: (TA:) and [particularly] one of the best of she-camels: (S, K:) or,
of he-camels: (T:) pl. بُرَحٌ. (T, S, K.) You say,
هٰذِهِ بُرْحَةٌ مِنَ البُرَحِ, (S, K, *) or هُوَ بُرْحَةٌ مِنَ البُرَحِ,
(T,) This is a she-camel, (S, K, *) or he is a
camel, (T,) of the best of camels. (T, S, K.)
بَرْحَي a word that is said when one misses the
mark in shooting or casting; like as مَرْحَي is said
when one hits the mark. (S, ISd, A, K.)
بُرَحَآءُ Severity, violence, or sharpness, (As, A,
TA,) or vehement molestation, (S, K,) of a fever
(As, A, S, K) &c.: (S, K:) [a paroxysm; used
in this sense by modern physicians:] and vehement distress of mind arising from the oppression
caused by inspiration or revelation; such as is
said to have affected the Prophet; [but most
probably a paroxysm of that species of catalepsy
which physicians term ecstasy;] occurring in a
trad. (TA.) You say of one suffering from fever,
when it is intense, أَصَابَتْهُ البُرَحَآءُ [The paroxysm,
or severe fit, has befallen him]. (TA.)
البِرَحِينَ and البُرَحِينَ &c.: see بَرْحٌ
بَرَاحٌ inf. n. of بَرِحَ, q. v.; whence the phrase
لَا بَرَاحَ, explained above. (S, L, K.)
-A2-  A wide,
or spacious, tract of land, (S, A, K,) kaving in it
no seed-produce nor trees: (S, K:) or land having
in it no building nor habitation: (Ham p. 237:)
and applied as an epithet to land, signifying wide,
or spacious, open, or conspicuous, and having in
it no herbage nor habitation: and what is open,
uncovered, and wholly apparent, of land: (TA:)
or a place having no trees nor other things to
cover or conceal it; as though such things had
departed; (Mgh;) a place free from trees &c.:
(Msb:) or an elevated and open tract of land.
(Har p. 134.) ―
-b2-  حَبِيلُ بَرَاحٍ is an appellation
given to (tropical:)  A lion: and (assumed tropical:)  a courageous man: as
though each of them were bound with ropes, (K,
TA,) and did not quit his place. (TA.)
-A3-  An
affair, a thing, or a case, that is plain, evident, or
manifest; (K, TA;) or open, or public. (TA.)
You say, جَآءَنَا بِالأَمْرِ بَرَاحًا [He told us, or did to
us, the thing] plainly [or openly]. (S.) And
جَآءَ بِالكُفْرِ بَرَاحًا وَ بِالشَّرِّ صُرَاحًا [He uttered, or
committed an act of, infidelity plainly, or openly,
and evil, or mischief, unmixedly]. (A, TA.) ―
-b2-
Counsel, or an opinion, that is disapproved, or
deemed evil. (K.)
-A4-  بَرَاحِ, (El-Mufaddal, S, A,
&c.,) and بَرَاحُ, with damm and without tenween,
(AZ, El-Mufaddal,) a name of The sun: (S, A,
&c.:) determinate [and the former indecl.]: the
sun is so called because of the spreading of its
light, and its conspicuousness; or, being applied
to the sun when it sets, براح means بَارِحَةٌ; like as
كَسَابِ, a name applied to a hunting-bitch, means
كَاسِبَةٌ. (TA.) You say, دَلَكَتْ بَرَاحِ The sun set [or
declined from the meridian]. (A, TA.) For this
phrase, occurring at the end of a verse cited by
Ktr, Fr reads دَلَكَتْ بِرَاحِ; راح being pl. [or
rather a quasi-pl. n.] of رَاحَةٌ, meaning the “hand”
[or “palm of the hand”]: (S, TA:) accord. to
which reading, the poet means The sun had
set, or had declined from the meridian, while
they put their hands, or the palms of their
hands, over their eyes, looking to see if it had
set, or had declined from the meridian: or
he who says, دَلَكَتِ الشَّمْسُ بِرَاحِ means the sun
had almost set: the two readings بَراح and بِراح
are mentioned by A'Obeyd and Az and Hr and Z
and others: AZ says, دلكت بِرَاحٍ, with tenween,
and بَرَاحٌ, without tenween. (TA.) [See also
رَاحَةٌ, in art. روح.]
بَرُوحٌ: see بَارِحٌ.
بَرِيحٌ: see بَارِحٌ.
-A2-  Also The croaking of the
غُرَاب [or crow, of whatever species, as raven,
carrion-crow, &c.]. (L.) ―
-b2-  [Hence,] اِبْنُ بَرِيحٍ:
so in the K: in the S, أُمُّ بَرِيحٍ; but IB and
Aboo-Zekereeyà say that only the former is right:
(TA:) [in one copy of the S, however, I find
both of these:] The غُرَاب [or crow, as a generic
term, applying to the raven, carrion-crow, &c.]:
(S, K, &c.:) so called because of its cry: a determinate appellation: for the pl., the expression
used is بَنَاتُ بَرِيحٍ. (TA.) ―
-b3-  See also بَرْحٌ.
-A3-
قَوْلٌ بَرِيحٌ A saying by which one pronounces a
person to have said, or done, right. (L.)
بَارِحٌ, (S, K, &c.,) as also ↓ بَرُوحٌ and ↓ بَرِيحٌ,
(K,) applied to a gazelle, (S,) or what is hunted
or shot, (K, TA,) of gazelles and birds and wild
animals [in general], (TA,) Turning his left side
towards the spectator, (S,) passing from the direction of the right hand of the latter towards the
direction of his left hand: (S, K:) or turning his
right side towards the spectator, passing from the
direction of the latter's left hand towards that of
his right: (Aboo-'Amr Esh-Sheybánee, IF, A, *
L, Msb, * in art. سنح:) contr. of سَانِحٌ: (S, *
TA:) pl. بَوَارِحُ. (L in art. سنح.) The Arabs
[who apply the epithet in the latter sense] regard
the بارح as an evil omen, and the سانح as a good
omen; because one cannot shoot at the former
without turning himself: (S:) but some of them
hold the reverse: (Aboo-'Amr Esh-Sheybánee
and L in art. سنح:) the people of Nejd hold the
سانح to be a good omen; but sometimes a Nejdee
adopts the opinion of the Hijázee [which is the
contrary]. (IB in that art.) The first of these
epithets is also applied to a bird as meaning Inauspicious; ill-omened. (A.) It is said in a
prov., مَنْ لِى بِا لسَّانِحِ بَعْدَ البَارِحِ (TA) i. e. [Who
will be responsible to me] for a fortunate, or lucky,
event, after an unfortunate, or unlucky? (K in
art. سنح:) applied in the case of a man's doing
evil, and its being said, “He will at a future time
do good to thee:” originally said by a man on
the occasion of gazelles' passing before him in the
manner of such as are termed بَارِحَة, and its being
said to him, “They will present themselves to
thee in the manner of such as are termed سَانحَة.”
(TA.) And in another prov. it is said, إِنَّمَا هُوَ
كَبَارِحِ الأَرْوَى [It, or he, is only like the mountain-goat passing in the manner of such as is
termed بارح]: for it dwells on the tops of the
mountains, and men scarcely ever see it passing
with the right or left side towards them save once
in the course of ages: (S, K:) applied in the case
of an extraordinary occurrence: (K:) [or in the
case of a benefit conferred by a man who very
rarely confers benefits on others: (Freytag's Arab.
Prov. i. 35:)] or when a man has delayed, or
been tardy in, visiting [but has come at last].
(TA.) ―
-b2-  Hence, فِتْلَةٌ بَارِحَةٌ i. q. شَزْرَةٌ [i. e. (tropical:)  A
manner of twisting contrary to that which is
usual: see شَزَرَ]. (A.) ―
-b3-  And هٰذِهِ فَعْلةٌ بَارِحَةٌ
(tropical:)  This is an action that has not happened rightly.
(A.) ―
-b4-  [Hence,] بِنْتُ بَارِحٌ: and [perhaps] لَقِيتُ
مِنْهُ بَرْحًا بَارِحًا: and بَرْحٌ لِعَيْنَكَ بَارِحٌ: see بَرْحٌ.
―
-b5-  [And hence, perhaps, because of its evil effect;
or because it comes, accord. to some, from the
left, i. e. northerly direction, or, accord. to others,
from the right, i. e. southerly direction; or] from
بَرْحٌ as signifying “a difficult, a distressing, an
afflictive, or adverse, and a wonderful, thing, or
event;” (Ham p. 135;) بَارِحٌ signifies also A hot
wind: (S:) or a hot wind in the صَيْفٌ [i. e. summer or spring]: (K:) or a hot wind coming from
the direction of El-Yemen: (Ham p. 135:) or a
wind that carries up, raises, or sweeps up and
scatters, the dust: (Msb:) pl. بَوارِحُ: (S, K, &c.:)
or the بوارح are hot north, or northerly, winds in
the صَيْف: (AZ, Az, S:) this Az found to be the
sense in which the term was used by the Arabs in
his time: (TA:) or violent winds that carry with
them the dust by reason of their violence: (TA:)
or this name (the pl.) was given by the Arabs to
all winds in the time of the stars of the قَيْظ [or
summer]: they mostly blow in the time of the
stars of Libra; [app. meaning when Libra is on,
or near, the meridian at nightfall, agreeably with
a statement in modern Arabic almanacs, that the
periods of the beginning and end of the winds
thus called are the 30th of May and the 9th of
July;] and these winds are what are termed the
سَمَائِم [pl. of سَمُومٌ]. (Ibn-Kunáseh, TA.) ―
-b6-
البَوَارِحُ is also said by some to signify الأَنْوَآءُ [pl.
of نَوْءٌ, q. v.]; as mentioned by AHn; but he
repels their assertion. (TA.)
البَارِحَةُ The next, or nearest, past, or preceding,
night; yesternight: (S, A, Mgh, * Msb, * K:) from
بَرِحَ signifying زَالَ [“he, or it, went away” &c.].
(S, A.) [In modern Arabic, Yesterday; as also
البَارِح.] It has no dim. formed from it. (Sb, in S, in
art. أمس; and TA.) You say, لَقِيتُهُ البَارِحَة [I met,
or met with, him, or it, last night, or yesternight]:
and لَقِيتُهُ البَارِحَةَ الأُولَي [I met, or met with, him, or
it, the night before last; this being the sense in which
the phrase is now used by the learned: but the vulgar expression is أَوَّل البَارِحَة, generally pronounced
أَوَّل اَمْبَارِحَهْ or أَوَّل اَمْبَارِحْ, agreeably with a peculiarity of the dial. of the people of El-Yemen, or
of Teiyi and Himyer, by the substitution of اَمْ
for اَلْ: see art. ام]. (S) From daybreak to the
time when the sun declines from the meridian,
one says, رَأَيْتُ اللَّيْلَةَ فِى مَنَامِى [I saw to-night
in my sleep (such a thing)]; but when the sun
has declined, one says, رَأَيْتُ البَارِحَةَ [I saw last
night, or yesternight]: (AZ, Th: [and the like is
said in the Mgh and Msb:]) or one says, كَانَ
كَذَا وَ كَذَا اللَّيْلَةَ [Such and such things happened
to-night] until the sun is somewhat high and the
day has become bright; but after this, one says,
كَانَ البَارِحَةَ [It happened last night, or yesternight]. (Yoo, Seer.) The Arabs say,
مَا أَشْبَهَ اللَّيْلَةَ بِا لبَارِحَةِ
How like is this night wherein we are to the
former night that has departed! (TA:) [or, this
night to yesternight!]: originally occurring in a
poem of Tarafeh: used as meaning “how like is
the child to the father!” and applied to [any] two
things resembling each other. (Har p. 667.)
أَبْرَحُ is formed [from بَرَحَ for بَرَّحَ] by the
rejection of the added letter: [for a word of this
kind is regularly formed only from an unaugmented triliteral-radical verb:] or it is like أَحْنَكُ,
having no proper verb. (L.) You say, هٰذَا
أَبْرَحُ عَلَىَّ مِنْ ذَاكَ (A, * L, Msb *) This is
more difficult, distressing, or afflicting, to me
than that. (L, Msb. *) And هٰذَآ الأَمْرُ أَبْرَحُ مِنْ
هٰذَا This affair, event, or case, is more difficult,
or distressing, than this. (S.) And قَتَلُوهُمْ أَبْرَحَ
قَتْلٍ [They slew them with a most severe slaughter]. (S.)
تَبْرِيحٌ [inf. n. of 2, used as a simple subst.,]
is said by some to be sing. of تَبَارِيحُ, and has
been used as such by post-classical authors, but
is not of established authority: accord. to others,
the latter has no sing.: (MF:) the pl. signifies
Difficulties, distresses, afflictions, or adversities:
[see also بَرْحٌ:] or the difficulties, or obligations,
incurred by troublesome, or inconvenient, means
of obtaining subsistence: (TA:) and تَبَارِيحُ الشَّوْقِ
the burning, or fierce burning, [or the burnings,
&c.,] of the yearning, or longing, of the soul,
or of longing desire. (S, K.)
أنَا مُبَرَّحٌ بِى I am importuned, or pressed, with
annoyance, or molestation. (A, TA.) [See the
verb (2).]
مُبَرِّحٌ and ↓ بَرِحٌ, applied to an affair, an event,
or a case, signify the same; (K, TA;) i. e.
Severe, afflicting, distressing, or harassing: (TA:)
and the former, to a beating, (S, A, Mgh, TA,)
meaning the same; (TA;) or hurting (S, Mgh)
severely: (S:) and to a man, meaning annoying,
or molesting, by importuning, or pressing. (TA.)
[See 2.] لَقِيتُ مِنْهُ بَرْحًا مُبَرِّحًا: see بَرْحٌ.
يَبْرُوحٌ, (K,) thus correctly written, with the ى
before the ب; [not بيروح, as in the CK; in
Chald.
יַבְרוּחַ, the word corresponding to the
sing. of the Hebr.
דּוּרָאִי� in Gen. xxx. 14 and
16, accord. to the paraphrase of Onkelos;] or
يَبْرُوحٌ صَنَمِىٌّ [the idol-like يبروح]; (TA;) The
root, or lower part, of the wild لُفَّاح [or mandrake,
not to be confounded with another plant to which
the name of لُفَّاح, q. v., is also applied], (K,)
which is known by the names of فَاوَانِيَا and عُودُ
الصَّلِيبِ [names now given to the peony], and
called by MF تُفَّاحُ البَرِّ, [or the wild apple, but
perhaps this is a mistranscription for لُفَّاحُ البَرِّ,]
said by him to be an appellation used by the
vulgar; (TA;) resembling the form of a man;
(K;) and of two sorts, male and female; called
by the people of Greece عَبْدُ السَّلَامِ: (TA:) it
torpifies, (K,) and strengthens the two appetites
[namely that of the stomach and that of the generative organ): (TA:) if ivory is cooked with
it for six hours, it renders it soft; and if a part
affected by [the disease termed] بَرَش is rubbed
with its leaves for a week, (K,) without interruption, (TA,) it removes it without causing
ulcers, or sores: (K:) the root of the wild لُفَّاح
is the يَبْروح: it has the form of a human being;
the male like the male, and the female like the
female; and they pretend that he who pulls it
up dies; wherefore, when they desire to do so, they
tie a dog or some other animal to it. (Kzw, voce
لُفَّاح.)
