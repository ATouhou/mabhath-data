to prevent her being sucked]; (Bd in iii. 54;) as
also ↓ ابلها: (S:) or he left her to be milked;
or allowed her being milked: (Z, TA:) and ↓ the
latter, he loosed her صِرَار, and left her young one
at liberty to such her; (K;) and he left her to
herself (K, TA) to be milked by any one who
pleased. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And بَهَلَهُ, (S, K,) aor.

or wish, (S,) or to his own opinion, or judgment;
(K;) as also ↓ ابهلهُ: (S, K:) or the former is

[Whosoever will, I will contend with him by imprecating the curse of God upon whichever of us is
wrong, that the shorter chapter of “Women” came
down from heaven after the chapter of “The
Cow”]: or, accord. to one recital, he said لَا عَنْتُهُ:
for when they differed respecting a thing, they
used to come together, and say, اللّٰهِ عَلَى ↓ بَهْلَةُ
الظَّالِمِ مِنَّا [The curse of God be upon such of us
as is the wrongdoer!]. (Mgh.) باهل بَعْضُهُمْ

cursed one another: (K:) [or] they joined in
imprecating a curse upon such of them as was

(Bd, TA,) as some explain it, (TA,) meaning
↓ ثُمَّ نَتَبَاهَلْ, i. e., Then let us imprecate a curse
upon such of us as is the liar. (Bd. [But see

أَبْهَلٌ The produce, or fruit, of a certain tree,
which is the عَرْعَر [a name applied to the cypress
and to the juniper-tree]: (S:) so says Ibn-Seenà
[Avicenna] in the Kánoon; and he adds that it
is of two species, small and great, both brought
from the country of the رُوم: one species of the
tree thereof has leaves like those of the سَرْو [or
common, evergreen, cypress], has many thorns,
and grows, or spreads, wide, (يَسْتَعْرِضُ,) not
growing tall: the leaves of the other are like those
of the طَرْفَآء [or tamarisk], the taste thereof is like
[that of] the سَرْو, and it is drier, and less hot:
(TA:) or it is the produce of a kind of great
tree, the leaves of which are like [those of] the
طرفاء, and the fruit of which is like the نَبِق [or
fruit of the lote-tree called سِدْر]; and it is not
[the fruit of] the عرعر, as J imagined it to be:
the smoke thereof expels quickly the young in the
womb: used as a liniment, with vinegar, it cures
what is termed دَآء الثَّعْلَب [alopecia]: and with
honey, it cleanses foul ulcers. (K.) [In the present day, it is applied to the juniper-tree; as is
also عَرْعَر; and particularly to the species thereof
called the savin. See قَطِرَانٌ.]
