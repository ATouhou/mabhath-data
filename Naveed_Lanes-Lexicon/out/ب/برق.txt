plant, having slender branches, at the heads of
which are small envelopes (قَمَاعِيلُ صِغَارٌ) like
chick-peas, in which is a kind of black grain: its
feebleness is such that it withers on the spot when
the sun becomes hot upon it: and nothing feeds
upon it; but men, when they are afflicted with
dearth, or drought, express from it a bitter juice,
then work it together, or knead it, with هَبِيد [or
colocynths, or the pulp, or seeds, thereof], or some
other thing, and eat it; but it is not eaten alone,
because it occasions excitement: it is one of the
plants that are plentiful in time of drought and
scarce in time of fruitfulness; when copious rain
falls upon it, it dies; and when we see it to have
become abundant, and coarse, or rough, we fear
drought: accord. to another of the Arabs of the
desert, the بَرْوَقَة is a bad kind of herb, or leguminous plant, that grows among the first of the herbs,
or leguminous plants: it has a reed like the سباط

which is Syriac; (IDrd, TA;) or from the Persian, (S, TA,) in which سِتَبْر and إِسْتَبْر signify
“ thick,” absolutely, whence سِتَبْرَهْ and إِسْتَبْرَهْ are
particularly applied to signify “ thick ديباج, and
then the latter is arabicized by substituting ق for
the ه: so says Esh-Shiháb El-Khafájee: or the ا
and س and ت are augmentative, and it is mentioned in the present art. in the S and K as
though this were the case, agreeably with the
form of its dim., which is said by J and in the K
to be ↓ أُبَيْرِقٌ; for in forming the dim., a word is
reduced to its root. (TA.)
