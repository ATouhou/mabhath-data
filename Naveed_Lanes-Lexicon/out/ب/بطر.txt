exulted greatly, or excessively; and behaved insolently and unthankfully, or ungratefully: or
he exulted by reason of wealth, and behaved with
pride and self-conceitedness, and boastfulness, and
want of thankfulness: or he behaved with the
utmost exultation, &c.: or he rejoiced, and rested
his mind upon things agreeable with natural
desire: syn. of the inf. n. أَشَرٌ, (S, A, L, Msb,
TA,) and مَرَحٌ; (L, TA;) the former of which
signifies شِدَّةٌ المَرَحِ, (S, A,) and مُجَاوَزَةُ الحَدِّ فِى
مَرَحٍ: (A:) he was, or became, stupified, deprived
of his reason, confounded, or amazed, (S, K, Er-Rághib,) bearing wealth ill, or in an evil manner,
performing little of the duty imposed on him by
it, and turning it to a wrong purpose: (Er-Rághib, TA, * TK:) this is said to be the primary
signification: (TA:) he was, or became, stupified,
or confounded, and knew not what to prefer nor
what to postpone: (TA:) he was, or became,
confounded, perplexed, or amazed, by reason of
fright: (As, S voce بَحِرَ:) he behaved exorbitantly, or insolently, with wealth, (K, TA,) or

had, or exercised, little of the quality of bearing
wealth [in a becoming, or proper, manner]: (K:)
he behaved proudly: (TA:) he regarded a thing
with hatred, or dislike, without its deserving to
be so regarded: he was, or became, brisk, lively,
or sprightly: (K:) accord. to some, he walked

gait, with an affected inclining of the body from
side to side. (TA.) It is said in a trad., لَا يَنْظُرُ
اللّٰهُ يَوْمَ القِيَامَةِ مَنْ جَرَّ إِزَارَهُ بَطَرًا [God will not
look, on the day of resurrection, upon him who
drags along his wrapper of the lower part of the
body in exultation and insolence, or pride: meaning one who wears too long a wrapper of the
lower part of the body]. (TA.) ―
-b2-  بَطِرْتَ عَيْشَكَ
(tropical:)  [Thou exultedst, or exultedst greatly, or excessively, and behavedst insolently and unthankfully,
or ungratefully, &c., in thy manner of life,] is a
phrase similar to رَشِدْتَ أَمْرَكَ; (S, TA;) and in
like manner بَطِرَتْ مَعِيشَتَهَا, in the Kur [xxviii. 58];
in which the verb is not trans., but the subst. is
put in the accus. case because of فِى understood
before it. (Aboo-Is-hák.) ―

which means (tropical:)  The considering as false, or vain,
what God has pronounced to be the truth, or
our duty; namely, the confession of his unity, and
the obligation of rendering Him religious service:
or the being confounded at considering truth, or
duty, and not seeing it to be true, or incumbent:
(TA:) or the disdaining the truth, or right, and
not accepting it or not admitting it. (K.)

ابطرهُ It rendered him such as is termed
بَطِر; it (wealth) caused him to exult, or to exult
greatly, or excessively, and to behave insolently
and unthankfully, or ungratefully: &c.: [see
بَطِرَ:] (S, A:) it stupified him, deprived him
of his reason, confounded him, or amazed him.
(S, K.) You say, مَا أَمْطَرَتْ حَتَّى أَبْطَرَتْ It (the

gravity. (TA.) ―
-b4-  ابطرهُ ذَرْعَهُ (tropical:)  He imposed upon
him more than he was able to do; (S;) what
was above his power: (K:) ذرعه is here a substitute for its antecedent to indicate an implication
therein: (A:) you say this when a slow-paced
camel has endeavoured in vain to keep pace with
another camel; and when any man has imposed
upon another a difficulty beyond his power: (TA:)
or the meaning is, he cut off his means of subsistence, and wasted his body: (IAar, K:) ذرع
signifying the “ body. ” (IAar.)
