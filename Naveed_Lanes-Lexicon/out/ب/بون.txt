بَانٌ [a coll. gen. n., The ben-tree; a species of
moringa; so in the present day;] a kind of tree,
(S, Mgh, Msb, K,) well known: (Msb:) n. un.
with ة: (S, Mgh, Msb:) its seed, or grain, [called
حَبُّ البَانِ and جَوْزُ البَانِ and فُسْتُقُ البَانِ, the glans
unguentaria, or nux unguentaria, or ben-nut,] has
a good, or pleasant, [fragrant] oil, (K,) called
دُهْنُ البَانِ [oil of ben], (S, Mgh, Msb,) and simply
بَانٌ, the prefixed noun being suppressed: (Mgh:)
[Az says,] it is the pl. of بَانَةٌ. which is a certain
tree having a fruit, or produce, which is perfumed
with aromatics, after which its oil is expressed, of
a good [or fragrant] quality: (T in art. بنى:
its seed, or grain, is good for [removing] the
[affections of the skin termed] بَرَش and نَمَش and
كَلَف and حَصَف and بَهَق and سَعَفَة and the
mange, or scab, and for the peeling of the skin,
applied in the form of a liniment with vinegar;
and for hardness of the liver and the spleen, made
into a beverage with vinegar; and a مِثْقَال thereof,
drunk, is an emetic, which loosens crude phlegm:
(K:) AHn says, (TA,) it is a kind of tree that
grows tall, in a straight, or an erect, manner,
like as grows the [species of tamarisk called]
أَثْل, and its leaves are [of the kind termed] هَدَب,
like those of the اثل, but its wood has no hardness:
the n. un. is with پ: Aboo-Ziyád says, it is of the
[trees called] عِضَاه, and has long هدب, intensely
green; it grows upon [hills, or what are termed]
هَضْب; and its fruit resembles the pods of the
[species of kidney-bean called] لُوبِيَآء, except that its
greenness is intense; and in it is a seed, or grain,
from which is extracted the oil of the بان: on
account of the straightness of its growth and of
the growth of its braches, and their length and
tenderness, the poets liken thereto the tender girl
of tall and beautiful, or just, stature; saying
كَأَنَّهَا بَانَةٌ [As though she were a ben-tree], and
كَأَنَّهَا غُصْنُ بَانٍ [As though she were a branch of
the ben-tree], &c.: thus does Keys Ibn-El-Kha-
teem: (M in art. بين:) and so does Imra-el-
Keys. (TA.) [See an ex. voce بَرَهْرَهَةٌ.] ―
-b2- [It
is also applied in the present day to A species of
willow, the salix Aegyptia of Linnæus, properly
called in Arabic خِلَاف: and this is said to be
meant by modern Arab poets when they liken an
elegant girl to a twig of the بان; but probably
from their erroneously supposing this tree to be
meant in the same case by the older poets.]
بَوْنٌ Excellence: an excellent quality; (S in
art. بين, Msb;) as also ↓ بَوْنَةٌ: (IAar; T:) or the
distance, space, or interval, between tow things;
as also darr; بُونٌ. (M, K.) You say, بَيْنَهُمَا بَوْنٌ بَعِيدٌ
(T, S, Msb*) and بَيْنٌ بَعِيدٌ (T, S) [Between them
two (meaning two men) is a wide distance]; i. e.
between their tow degrees of rank or dignity, or
between the estimations in which they are commonly held: (Msb:) the former phrase is the
more chaste: (S:) when corporeal distance is
meant, one says, بَيْنَهُمَا بَيْنٌ, with ى; (Msb;) or
in the case of [literal] distance, one says, إِنَّ بَيْنَهُمَا
لَبَيْنًا; not otherwise. (S.)
بُونٌ: see بَوْنٌ.
بَوْنَةٌ: see بَوْنٌ ―
-b2-  Also Mutual separation.
(IAar, T.)
