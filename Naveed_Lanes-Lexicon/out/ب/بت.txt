بت1
بَتَّهُ, (Lth, T, S, M, &c.,) aor.
بَتُ3َ and
بَتِ3َ, (S,
M, Msb,) the latter anomalous, because a reduplicative verb [of this kind] having the aor. with
kesr is not trans., except in certain instances, of
which this is one; the other instances being عَلَّهُ,
in relation to drinking, aor.
بَتُ3َ and
بَتِ3َ, and نَمَّ
الحَدِيثَ, aor.
بَتُ3َ and
بَتِ3َ, and شَدَّهُ, aor.
بَتُ3َ and
بَتِ3َ, and
حَبَّهُ, aor.
بَتِ3َ; the last having but one form [of
aor.]; (S;) inf. n. بَتٌّ: (Lth, T, S, M, A, &c.:)
and ↓ ابتّهُ, (M,) inf. n. إِبْتَاتٌ: (Mgh, K:) He cut
it off, severed it, separated it, or disunited it,
(Lth, T, S, M, A, * Mgh, * Msb, K, *) entirely, or
utterly; (Lth, T, M;) namely, a thing; (M;)
a rope, or cord; (Lth, T;) and a tie, or bond, of
union between two persons. (M.) ―
-b2-  [بَتَّهُ and
↓ ابتّهُ, accord. to the TA, app. signify also He, or
it, caused him (a man) to become unable to proceed in his journey, his camel that bore him
breaking down, or stopping from fatigue, or
perishing: for انبتّ as signifying “he became
so” is there said to be quasi-pass. of those two
verbs when it has this sense. Hence,] بَتَّهُ السَّفَرُ
[The journey caused him to become cut off, &c.].
(A.) And سَاقَ دَابَّتَهُ حَتَّي بَتَّهَا [He urged on his
beast so that, or until, he caused it to become cut
off, &c.]: (A:) and بَعِيرَهُ ↓ أَبَتَّ He caused his
camel to become cut off, &c., (قَطَعَةُ,) by travel:
(M, TA:) this is not said but of a man who has
forced on his camel at a hard pace, or by laborious
journeying. (TA.) ―
-b3-  بَتَّ طَلَاقَ امْرَأَتِهِ, (T, Msb,
TA,) or طَلَاقَ المَرْأَةِ, (Mgh,) and ↓ أَبَتَّهُ, (Lth, T,
Mgh, Msb,) He made the divorce of his wife, or
of the woman, to be absolutely separating, (Lth,
T, Mgh, Msb, TA,) so as to cut her off from
return. (Msb.) Lth, with whom AZ agrees, has
erred in asserting that بَتَّ is intrans. and ↓ أَبَتّ
trans.: (T, TA:) both are trans. and intrans.,
(T, Msb, TA,) as En-Nawawee asserts in the
Tahdheeb el-Asmà wa-1-Loghát. (TA.) You say,
الطَّلْقَةُ الوَاحِدَةُ تَبُتُّ, and ↓ تُبِتُّ, i. e. The single
divorce cuts the matrimonial tie, or bond, of the
woman, (تَقْطَعُ عِصْمَةَ النِّكَاحِ, T, Mgh, *) when the
period during which she must wait before contracting a new marriage has ended. (T.) [See
also بَتٌّ.] ―
-b4-  بَتَّ عَلَيْهِ القَضَآءَ, (T, S, M, A,) inf. n.
بَتٌّ; (M;) and ↓ أَبَتَّهُ; (T, S, M;) He (the judge,
T) decided the judgment, or sentence, against him.
(T, S, * M.) ―
-b5-  بَتَّ عَلَيْهِ الشَّهَادَةَ, and ↓ أَبَتَّهَا, He
decided against him by the testimony, [or pronounced the testimony decisive against him,] and
compelled, or constrained, him to admit it. (M.)
―
-b6-  بَتَّ شَهَادَتَهُ, and ↓ أَبَتَّهَا, He gave his testimony
decisively. (Msb.) ―
-b7-  أَبُتُّ أَنَّهُ قَالَ I know, or
declare, decidedly, not [merely] thinking it, that
he said thus. (Saheeh of Muslim.) ―
-b8-  بَتَّ النِّيَّةَ
He made the intention decided; or fixed it decidedly. (A.) It is said in a trad., لَا صِيَامَ لِمَنْ
الصّيَامِ مِنَ اللَّيْلِ ↓ لَمْ يُبِتَّ, (T, S, Mgh,) or لَمْ يَبُتَّ,
accord. to different recitals, (Mgh,) i. e. There is
no fasting to him [meaning his fasting is null]
who does not decisively impose it upon himself, by
intention, from the night: (S, * Mgh:) or, who
does not form the intention of fasting before daybreak, and thus cut it off from the time in which
there is no fasting, namely, the night: the intention
is termed بَتٌّ [and إِبْتَاتٌ] because it makes a division between non-fasting and fasting: (T, TA:)
لَمْ يُبِت, from الإِبَاتَةُ, is a mistake; but لم يُبَيِّت,
from التَّبْيِيتُ, [see بَيَّتَ,] is correct. (Mgh.) And
it is said in another trad., نِكَاحَ هٰذِهِ النِّسَآءِ ↓ أَبِتُّوا,
i. e. Decide ye the affair respecting the marriage
of these women, and confirm it by its [proper]
conditions: an oblique prohibition of the kind of
marriage termed نِكَاحُ المُتْعَةِ, because it is a marriage not [absolutely or lawfully] decided, [being]
made definite as to duration. (TA.) ―
-b9-  بَتَّ also
signifies He made to have, or take, effect; he
executed, or performed; (Har p. 210;) and so
↓ ابتّ, as in the phrase, ابتّ يَمِينَهُ He made his
oath to have, or take, effect; he executed, or performed, it. (M.) ―
-b10-  سَكْرِانُ مَا يَبُتُّ كَلَامًا, (Ks,
T, M,) and ما يَبِتُّ, (M,) and ↓ ما يُبِتُّ, (Ks, T,
M,) One who is drunk, who does not speak
plainly, or distinctly; lit., who does not make
speech plain, or distinct; (Ks, T;) or who does
not articulate speech; syn. مَا يَقْطَعُهُ: (M:) or,
as As says, (T,) سَكْرَانُ مَا يَبُتُّ, (T, A,) or لَا يَبُتُّ,
(S, K,) and لا يَبِتُّ, and ↓ لا يُبَتُّ, (K,) which last
form of the verb is disallowed by As, but both are
correct accord. to Fr, (T, S,) meaning one who is
drunk, who does not, or will not, [i. e. cannot,]
decide an affair. (As, T, S, K.) [See also بَاتٌّ.]

-b2-  [Hence,] بَتّتْ يَمِينُهُ, (M, Msb,)
aor.
بَتِ3َ only, inf. n. بُتُوتٌ, (Msb,) His oath bad, or
took, effect; was executed, or performed; syn.

needing any explanation. (M.) [See ابتّ يَمِينَهُ,
above.]

2
بتّتهُ, inf. n. تَبْتِيتٌ, He cut it off, or severed
it, [entirely, or utterly, and] much, or with extraordinary energy or effectiveness; the teshdeed
denoting intensiveness of signification. (S.)

thing; (M;) a rope, or cord; (Lth, T;) and a
tie, or bond, of union between two persons: (T,
M: *) as also ↓ بَتَّ, (Lth, AZ, T, M, Msb,) aor.
بَتِ3َ
and
بَتُ3َ, (M, [so accord. to a copy of that work,
but it seems to be indicated in the Msb (see 1,
near the close of the paragraph,) that it is
بَتِ3َ only,
in this case,]) inf. n. بَتٌّ; (Lth, AZ, T, M, K;)
and ↓ ابتّ, (T, Msb, TA,) inf. n. إِبْتَاتٌ; (T, TA;)
the last said by Lth and AZ to be trans. only;
(T, TA;) but it is both trans. and intrans., like
the second: (T, Msb, TA:) so says En-Nawawee,
as mentioned above: see 1. (TA.) You say,
اِنْقَطَعَ فُلَانٍ فَانْبَتَّ حَبْلُهُ عَنْهُ [Such a one
broke off, or disunited himself, from such a one,

بَتٌّ inf. n. of 1, q. v. (Lth, T, S, M, &c.) [It
is sometimes used as an inf. n.; as also ↓ بَتّةٌ and
↓ بَتَاتٌ, explained in the M as syn. with قَطْعٌ:
and sometimes, as is often the case with inf. ns.,
in the sense of the act. part. n. of its verb,
namely ↓ بَاتٌّ, trans. and intrans.; as also ↓ بَتَاتٌ;
both of which are masc. and fem., because originally inf. ns.; but بَتٌّ has also بَتَّةٌ for its fem.
The following are exs.] ―
-b2-  أَعْطَيْتُهُ هٰذِهِ العَطِيَّةَ
بَتَّا بَتْلًا [I gave him this gift, cutting it off from
my property so as to make it irrevocable; or,

Such a one bestowed an alms, or a gift for the
sake of God, cut off from his property; (T,
TA;) and therefore, (TA,) parted from himself.
(S, TA.) Such a gift is termed صَدَقَةٌ بَتَّةٌ, (A, *

-b3-  طَلَّقَهَا,

T, S: *) or طَحَنَ بَتَّا signifies he began in the

allow only the former, and that only Fr allows
the latter, (TA,) and some say that the former
has been heard pronounced with the disjunctive.
[اَلْبَتَّةَ], (MF,) and thus it is written in a copy of
the K, (TA,) but others greatly disapprove of this,
(MF,) [meaning I will not do it, decidedly, or
absolutely,] is said of anything in respect of which
there is no returning, or revoking; (S, IF, M,

[Az adds,] what we remember to have heard
from those deserving of confidence is تَابٌّ, from
