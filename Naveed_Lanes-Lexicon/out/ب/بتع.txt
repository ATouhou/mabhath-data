fresh dates: (Ibn-El-Beytár, cited by Golius:)
or the pure juice of grapes; (Ibn-' Abbád, K;)

-A2-  It is also a
word used as a corroborative: you say, جَاؤُوا
أَجْمَعُونَ أَكْتَعُونَ أَبْتَعُونَ [They came, all of them,
or all together]: (S:) and جَآءَ القَوْمُ أَكْتَعُونَ
أَبْتَعُونَ أَبْصَعُونَ [the people, or company of men,
came, all of them, or all together]: (AHeyth:)
and جَاؤُوا كُلُّهُمْ أَجْمَعُونَ أَكْتَعُونَ أَبْتَعُونَ
[they came, all of them, all together]: these words
which follow اجمعون being imitative sequents to
it, not occurring save after it [in the order above]:
(O, K:) or one may begin with whichsoever of
them he will, after it. (Ibn-Keysán, K.) And
[the fem. is بَتْعَآءُ:] you say القَبِيلَةُ كُلُّهَا جَمْعَآءُ
كَتْعَآءُ بَصْعَآءُ بَتْعَآءُ [The tribe, all of it, all together:
in the CK, erroneously, كُثْعآءُ (with damm and
ث) and بُصْعاءُ and بُتْعاءُ]. (K.) And [the pl. of
بَتْعَآءُ is ↓ بُتَعُ, originally بَتْعَاوَاتٌ:] you say النِّسَآءُ
كُلُّهُنَّ جُمَعُ كُتَعُ بُصَعُ بُتَعُ [The women, all of
them, all together: in the CK, erroneously, جُمَعٌ
كُتَعٌ بُصَعٌ بُتَعٌ, though it is well known that each
of these is determinate, and imperfectly declinable]. (K.) It is only necessary that he who
mentions all these words should mention first
كُلّ, and follow it with the word formed from
ج م ع, then add the rest in whatsoever order he
will; but the more approved way is to put the
word formed from ك ت ع before the rest. (TA.)
Fr mentions the phrases أَعْجَبنِى القَصْرُ أَجْمَعَ [The
palace pleased me, all of it, or altogether], and
الدَّارُ جَمْعَآءَ [the house, all of it, or altogether],
with the accus. case, as denotative of state; but does
not allow أَجْمَعُونَ nor جُمَعُ to be used otherwise
than as corroboratives: IDrst, however, allows
أَجْمَعِينَ to be used as a denotative of state; and
this is correct; and accord. to both these ways
is related the trad., فَصَلُّوا جُلُوسًا أَجْمَعِينَ and
أَجْمَعُونَ [And pray ye sitting, all of you, or all
together]; though some make اجمعين [here] to
be a corroborative of a pronoun understood in the
accus. case, as though the speaker said, أَعْنِيكُمْ
أَجْمَعِينَ [I mean you, all of you, or all together].
(K.) [But see أَجْمعُ.]
