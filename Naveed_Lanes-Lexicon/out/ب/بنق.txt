2
بنّق القَمِيصَ, inf. n. تَبْنِيقٌ, He put a بَنِيقَة
to the shirt. (K.) ―
-b2-  بنّق الجَعْبَةَ (tropical:)  He made the
upper part of the quiver wide [by adding to it
the like of a بَنِيقَة (see the pass. part. n., below,)],
and the lower part narrow: (K, TA:) or he
widened its upper part, the lower part being [or
remaining] narrow. (JK.)
بِنَقٌ: see what next follows.
بِنَقَةٌ: see what next follows.
بِنَيقٌ: see what next follows.
بِنَيقَةٌ The لِبْنَة, (AZ, Abu-l-Hajjáj El-Aalam,
JK, S, K,) or دِخْرِصَة, (Abu-l-'Abbás El-Ahwal,
TA,) [both of which signify the gore,] of a shirt,
(AZ, S, K,) or of a garment; (JK;) or the
دخرصة is longer than the لبنة: (Seer, TA:) and
any piece that is added in a garment or a
leathern bucket to widen it: (Abu-l-Hajjáj ElAalam, TA:) or, accord. to IDrd, the دخاريص
of a shirt: (TA: [but this is app. a mistranscription for its sing. دِخْرِيص, q. v., a dial. var. of
دِخْرِصَة:]) or the جُرُبَّان [or opening at the neck
and bosom] of a shirt: (K:) جربّان is prefixed to
البنيقة in a verse of Jereer, governing the latter
in the gen. case, to show that both these words
have the same meaning: (TA:) ↓ بِنَقَةٌ, also, signifies the same as بنيقة; (JK, K; [in the latter
of which it is mentioned in such a manner
as perhaps to denote that it has only the last
of the significations above; but I think that
this restriction is not meant;]) and its pl. [or
rather the coll. gen. n.] is ↓ بِنَقٌ: (Ibn-'Abbád,
TA:) Th mentions بَنَائِقٌ and بِنَقٌ, and says that
the latter is a pl. pl. ; [i. e., pl. of the former;]
but this is unintelligible: (TA:) بَنَائِقٌ is pl. of
بَنِيقَةٌ, (JK, S, &c.,) and syn. with دَخَارِيصٌ. (JK.)
AZ cites, from Mejnoon,
كَمَا ضَمَّ أَزْرَارَ القَمِيصِ البَنَائِقٌ
(S, IB,) which is an inverted phrase; the meaning being,
كَمَا ضَمَّ أَزْرَارُ القَمِيصِ البَنَائِقَا
[Like as the buttons of the shirt draw together
the gores: if the last word mean the gores]: or,
if the بنيقة of the shirt be really its جربّان, the
meaning is intelligible [without inversion]; for
its جربّان is the part around the neck, upon which
are sewed the buttons; and when one desires to
draw it together, he puts its buttons into the loops,
and so draws together the bosom [of the shirt,
with its buttons,] to the uppermost part of the
chest. (IB, TA.) Aboo-'Amr Esh-Sheybánee explains البنائق, here, as meaning the loops into
which the buttons are inserted; and accord. to
this explanation the meaning is plain, not requiring the supposition of inversion nor of deviation from the usual way: but the first explanation
is that which is generally given. (TA.) In the
saying,
↓ قَدْ أَغْتَدِى وَ الدَّهْرُ ذُو بَنِيقِ
[in the last word of which, ة is elided; lit., Sometimes I go forth early in the morning, when the
time has a بَنِيقَة;] Lth says that the whiteness
of the dawn is likened to the whiteness of the
بنيقة; citing another verse, in which a shirt is
described as having white بنائق. (TA.)
جَعْبَةٌ مُبنَّقَةٌ (tropical:)  A quiver that is widened: (Ibn-
'Abbád, TA:) or in the upper part of which is
added what resembles a بَنِيقَة, to enlarge it. (A,
TA.) ―
-b2-  طَرِيقٌ مُبَنَّقٌ (tropical:)  A wide road. (TA.)
أَرْضٌ مَبْنُوقَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  Land joined (مَوْصُولَة) to other
land, like as the بَنِيقَة of a shirt is joined. (ISd,
TA.) And مَفَازَةٌ مَبْنُوقَةٌ, (JK,) or مَبْنُوقَةٌ بِأُخْرَى,
(TA,) (tropical:)  [A desert, or a desert in which is no
water, &c.,] joined to another. (JK, TA.)
