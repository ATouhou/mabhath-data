بنج2
بنّجهُ, inf. n. تَبْنِيجٌ, [He dosed him, or stupified him, with بَنْج, q. v.;] he gave him بَنْج to
eat. (K.) [See the act. part. n. below.]
بَنْجٌ [Hyoscyamus, or henbane;] an arabicized
word, [said to be] from [the Persian] بَنْكْ; [but
see a quotation from Hammer-Purgstall, near the
close of this paragraph;] a certain plant, (Mgh,
and Har p. 365,) having an intoxicating kind of
grain, or, as some say, (Mgh,) of which the leaves
and peel and seeds torpify: (Mgh, Har:) it is
said, in the Kánoon, (Mgh,) by Aboo-'Alee [Ibn-Seenà, or Avicenna], (Har,) that it is a poison
which confuses the intellect, and annuls the memory,
and occasions insanity and [the disorder termed]
خُنَاق [or quinsy]; (Mgh, Har;) and it is red,
and white: (Har:) a certain plant having a kind
of grain that confuses the intellect, and occasions
alienation of the mind, or insanity; and sometimes
it intoxicates, when a man drinks it after it has
been dissolved; and it is said to occasion forgetfulness: (Msb:) a certain torpifying plant, well
known; different from حَشِيشُ الحَرَافِيشِ; disordering the intellect (مُخَبِّطٌ لِلْعَقْلِ), rendering
insane, allaying the pains of humours and pustules, and the earache, (K, TA,) applied as a
liniment or as a poultice; (TA;) the worst kind
(K, TA) for use (TA) is the black; then, the
red; and the safest kind is the white. (K, TA.)
[Kzw says that the leaves of the garden-hemp
(قِنَّب بُسْتَانِىّ, or شَهْدَانَجِ, the latter of which
properly signifies hemp-seed,) are the بَنْج which,
when eaten, disorders the intellect. And ElIdreesee applies the appellation حَشِيشِيَّة to the
“ Assassins. ” This establishes the correctness of
De Sacy's opinion, that the appellation “ Assassins ” is derived from the vulgar pl. حَشَّاشِين,
(hemp-eaters, or persons who intoxicate themselves with hemp,) for حَشَّاشِين is syn. with
حَشِيشَّة, and the sect called by us the “ Assassins ”
are expressly said by the Arabs to have made
frequent use of بَنْج. Baron Hammer-Purgstall,
correctly regarding بَنْج as hyoscyamus (or henbane), makes the following important observations,
“ ‘ Bendj, ’ the pl. of which in Coptic is ‘ nibendj, ’
is without doubt the same plant as the ‘ nepenthe, ’
which has hitherto so much perplexed the commentators of Homer. Helen evidently brought
the nepenthe from Egypt, and bendj is there still
reputed to possess all the wonderful qualities which
Homer attributes to it. ” (Trébutien, “Contes
Inédits des Mille et une Nuits,” tome i. p. 12,
note.)] The phrase شَرِبَ البَنْجَ is used by ElKarkhee [as meaning He drank the بنج] because
it is mixed with water; or [as meaning he took,
or swallowed, the بنج,] according to the conventional language of the physicians. (Mgh.)
مُبَنِّجٌ One who employs a stratagem by means
of food containing بَنْج [in order to obtain some
advantage over another, by stupifying him therewith; as the “ Assassins ” used to do]. (Mgh.)
