keep, or hold, back, or put back, or backward, his
nobility of lineage will not profit, [or advance, or

-b2-  One says, in
the dial. of Benoo-Yarbooa, (TA,) لَمْ أَفْعَلْهُ بُطْءًا
يَاهٰذَا, and ↓ بُطْأَى, [I never did it, lit.] I did it

بُطْأَى: see بُطْءٌ.
بُطْآنَ ذَا خُرُوجًا, and بَطْآنَ, (S, K,) but the
latter is extr., (TA,) i. q. ذَا خُرُوجًا ↓ بَطُؤَ [Slow,
or very slow, or how slow, is this in coming
forth!]; (S, K;) the fet-hah in [the last syllable
of] بَطُؤَ is transferred to the ن of بُطْآن, and the
dammeh of the ط [in the former] to the ب [in
the latter]; the meaning being one of wonder;
i. e. مَا أَبْطَأَهُ. (S, TA.) [بطآن is an enunciative
placed before its inchoative: and, being originally
بَطُؤَ, it may be a simple enunciative, or an enunciative having an intensive signification; as that
verb signifies simply “ it was slow,” &c., and
may be used as co-ordinate to رَمُوَ, meaning “ excellent is he in his shooting! ” &c., and قَضُوَ
“ excellent is he in his judging! ” &c.: or it may
be equivalent to مَا أَبْطَأَ, as it is said to be in the
S. See also سَرْعَانَ.]
بَطِىْءٌ Slow, tardy, dilatory, late, or backward; applied to a man, (S, Msb, TA,) and to
a horse or the like: (S, TA:) pl. بَطَآءٌ. (S, K,
TA.) ―
-b2-  Also an imitative sequent to حَطِىْءٌ.
(S in art. حطأ.)
أَبْطَأُ More, and most, slow, &c. (Meyd, &c.)
المَبْطَأُ for المَبْدَأُ is mentioned by AO. (TA on
the letter ط.)
