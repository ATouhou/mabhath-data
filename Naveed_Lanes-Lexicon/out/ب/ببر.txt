ببربَبْرٌ A certain beast of prey, (M, K,) well
known; (K;) a certain animal, (Msb,) namely,
the فُرَانِق [or lion's provider], (S,) that emulates,
or vies with, the lion in running, or that is hostile
to the lion: [so may be rendered the words
يُعَادِى الأَسَدَ; and in the uncertainty that exists
respecting the animal in question, the meaning
of this expression is doubtful: an animal may
be called (as the jackal is) the lion's provider
merely because the lion follows it and deprives
it of its prey:] (S, Msb:) or a certain Indian
animal, stronger than the lion, between which
and the lion and leopard, or panther, (نَمِر,)
exists hostility (مُعَادَاةٌ); when it attacks the
leopard, or panther, (نمر,), the lion aids the
latter; but the scorpion is on friendly terms
with it, and sometimes makes its abode in its
hair: (Kzw:) the word is foreign, or Persian,
(أَعْجَمِىٌّ,) [app. the Persian بَبَرْ, which is said to be
applied to the tiger, leopard, and lion,] arabicized:
(M, K:) Az thinks it to be a foreign word introduced into the Arabic language: (Msb:) pl. بُبُورٌ.
(S, Msb, K.)
