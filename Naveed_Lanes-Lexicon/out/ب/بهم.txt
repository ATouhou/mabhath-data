does corn; then it becomes like corn, and puts
forth prickles like those [that compose the awn,
or beard,] of the ear of corn, which, when they
enter the noses of the sheep or goats and the
camels, cause pain to their noses, until men pull
them out from their mouths and their noses; and
when it becomes large, and dries up, it is a pasture that is fed upon until the rain of the next
year falls upon it, when its seed that has fallen
from its ears germinates beneath it. (AHn, TA.)
