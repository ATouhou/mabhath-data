برك1
بَرَكَ, (S, Msb, K,) aor.
بَرُكَ, (S, TA,) inf. n.
بُرُوكٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and تَبْرَاكٌ, (K,) said of
a camel, (S, Mgh, Msb,) i. q. اِسْتَنَاخَ [i. e. He
lay down, or kneeled and lay down, upon his
breast, with his legs folded]; (S, K;) he made
his breast to cleave to the ground; (Mgh;) he
fell upon his بَرْك, i. e. breast; (Msb;) he threw
his برك, i. e. breast, upon the ground; (TA;)
and in like manner, ↓ برّك, (TA, and so in some
copies of the K,) inf. n. تَبْرِيكٌ. (TA.) And
بَرَكَتِ النَّعَامَةُ The ostrich lay upon its breast.
(TA.) And بَرَكَ is also said of a lion, and of a
man. (K voce ربض.) [Of the latter, one also
says, بَرَكَ عَلَى رُكْبَتَيْهِ He fell, or set himself,
upon his knees; he kneeled.] The بُرُوك of a man
praying, which is forbidden, is The putting down
the hands before the knees, after the manner of
the camel [when he lies down; for the latter falls
first upon his knees, and then upon his stiflejoints]. (Mgh.) ―
-b2-  Hence, i. e., from the verb
said of a camel, inf. n. بُرُوكٌ, (TA,) He, or it,
(i. e. anything, S,) was, or became, firm, steady,
steadfast, or fixed; continued, remained, or stayed;
(S, K;) in a place: (TK:) [and so, app., with
بَرِكَ
for its aor.; for] you say, بَرَكَ لِلْقِتَالِ, aor.
بَرِكَ, [He
was, or became, firm, &c., for the purpose of
fighting,] and in like manner بَرِكَ, aor.
بَرَكَ. (TA.
[See also a similar signification of 8.]) ―
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  It
(the night) was, or became, long, or protracted;
as though it did not quit its place. (A and TA
in art. قعس.) ―
-b4-  See also 8, in two places.
2
بَرَّكَ see 1.
-A2-  تَبْرِيكٌ also signifies The praying
for بَرَكَة, (S, K, TA,) for a man, &c. (TA.)
You say, بَرَّكْتُ عَلَيْهِ, inf. n. تَبْرِيكٌ, I said to
him, بَارَكَ اللّٰهَ عَلَيْكَ [or فِيكَ &c., God bless thee!
&c.]. (TA.) And برّك علي الطَّعَامِ He prayed
for, or invoked, a blessing on the food. (TK.)
3
بارك عَلَيْهِ He kept, or applied himself, constantly, or perseveringly, to it; (Lh, K;) namely,
an affair, (TA in art. حفظ,) or commerce, or
traffic, &c. (Lh, TA.)
-A2-  بارك اللّٰهُ فِيكَ, (Fr, S,
Msb, K,) and لَكَ, and عَلَيْكَ, (S, K,) and بَارَكَكَ,
(Fr, S, K,) inf. n. مُبَارَكَةٌ, (TK,) [God bless,
beatify, felicitate, or prosper, thee;] God put
in thee, (TA,) give thee, make thee to possess,
(T, K,) بَرَكَة [i. e. a blessing, good of any kind,
prosperity or good fortune, increase, &c.]. (TA,
TK.) بَارِكْ عَلَى مُحَمِّدٍ وَ عَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ (in a
trad., TA,) means Continue Thou, or perpetuate
Thou, (O God,) to Mohammad and to the family
of Mohammad the eminence and honour which
Thou hast given them: (K, TA:) [or still bless
or beatify, or continue to bless or beatify, Mohammad &c.: though it may well be rendered simply
bless or beatify &c.:] Az says that it is from
بَرَكَ said of a camel, meaning “he lay down upon
his breast in a place and clave thereto.” (TA.)
And اَللّٰهُمَ بَارِكْ لَنَا فِى المَوْتِ, in another trad.,
means [O God, bless us] in the state to which
death will bring us. (TA.) The Arabs say to
the beggar, بُورِكَ فِيكَ [Mayest thou be blest;
and, in the present day, اَللّٰه يُبَارِك فِيك God bless
thee]; meaning thereby to repel him; not to
pray for him: and by reason of frequency of
usage of this phrase, they have made ↓ بُورِك a
noun: a poet [in Har شريش العدوى (app. Sherees,
not Shereesh, El-'Adawee), in the TA Aboo-Fir'own,] says,
تَظُنُّ أَنَّ بُورِكًا يَكْفِينِى
إِذَا خَرَجْتُ بَاسِطًا يَمِينِى
[She imagines that the saying “Mayest thou be
blest” will suffice me when I go forth stretching
out my right hand for an alms]. (Har p. 378.
[This verse is differently cited in the TA; for there,
instead of تظنّ and خرجت, we find تُحِبُّ and
غَدَوْتُ.]) ―
-b2-  [You also say of a man, بارك فِيهِ,
and لَهُ, &c., meaning He blessed him; i. e. he
prayed God to bless him.] ―
-b3-  See also 6.
4
ابركهُ He made him (namely, a camel,) to
lie down [or kneel and lie down] upon his breast.
(S, K.) You say, أَبْرَكْتُهُ فَبَرَكَ I made him to
lie down upon his breast, and he lay down upon
his breast: but this is rare: the more common
phrase is أَنْخَتُهُ فَاسْتَنّاخَ. (S.)
-A2-  See also 8.
-A3-
مَا أَبْرَكَهُ [How blessed is he, or it!] is an instance
of a verb of wonder with a passive meaning [and
irregularly derived]. (TA.)
5
تبرّك بِهِ i. q. تَيَمَّنَ بِهِ [He had a blessing;
and he was, or became, blest; by means of him,
or it: so accord. to explanations of تَبَرُّكْ in the
KL: but very often signifying he looked for a
blessing by means of him, or it; he regarded him,
or it, as a means of obtaining a blessing; he
augured good from him, or it; تيمّن به being
opposed to تَشَأَّمَ به; as in the K in art. طير, and
in Bd in xvii. 14, &c.]: (S, K:) and ↓ تبارك
بِالشَّيْءِ He augured good from the thing. (Lth,
K.) One says so of a man. (K in art. مسح.)
And one says, تبرّك بِاسْمِ اللّٰهِ [He looked for a
blessing by means of uttering the name of God,
or saying بِسْمِ اللّٰهِ]. (Ksh, on the بسملة; &c.)
6
تبارك, accord. to Zj, is an instance of تَفَاعَلَ
[as quasi-pass. of فَاعَلَ, i. e., of بَارَكَ, like as تَبَاعَدَ
is of بَاعَدَ,] from البَرَكَةُ; and so say the lexicologists [in general]. (TA.) [Hence,] تبارك اللّٰهُ
means [Blessed is, or be, God; or] hallowed is,
or be, God; or far removed is, or be, He from
every impurity or imperfection, or from everything
derogatory from his glory; (K) or highly to
be exalted, or extolled, is God; or highly exalted,
or extolled, be He; (Abu-l-'Abbás, TA;) greatly
to be magnified is God; or greatly magnified be
He: (TA:) or i. q. ↓ بَارَكَ, like قَاتَلَ and تَقاَتَلَ,
except that فَاعَلَ is trans. and تَفَاَعَلَ is intrans.:
(S:) accord. to IAmb, it means [that] one looks
for a blessing by means of [uttering] his name
(يُتَبَرَّكُ بِاسْمِهِ) in every affair, or case: accord.
to Lth, it is a phrase of glorification and magnification: (TA:) or تبارك signifies He is abundant
in good; from البَرَكَةُ, which is “abundance of
good:” or He exceeds everything, and is exalted
above it, in his attributes and his operations;
because البَرَكَةُ implies the meaning of increase,
accession, or redundance: or He is everlasting;
syn. دَامَ; from بُرُوكُ الطَّيْرِ عَلَى المَآءِ [“the continuing of the birds at the water”]; whence
البِرْكَةُ, because of the continuance of the water
therein: the verb is invariable [when thus used,
being considered as divested of all signification
of time, or used in an optative sense]; and is not
employed [in any of the senses above] otherwise
than in relation to God: (Bd in xxv. 1:) it is an
attributive peculiar to God. (K.) ―
-b2-  تبارك بِالشَّىْءِ:
see 5.

ابترك He (a man) threw his بَرْك [i. e. breast
upon the ground (as the camel does in lying
down), or upon some other thing]. (S.) ―
-b2-  He
(a sword-polisher) leaned upon the polishing-instrument, (K,) on one side. (TA.) And He (a
horse) inclined on one side in his running. (TA:
[accord. to which, this is from what next follows.])
―
-b3-  He hastened, or sped, and strove, laboured,
or exerted himself, in running: (S, K:) and
↓ بَرَكَ, inf. n. بُرُوكٌ, (K,) or, as some say, this is
a subst. from the former verb, (TA,) He strove,
laboured, or exerted himself. (K.) ―
-b4-  (assumed tropical:)  It (a
cloud) rained continually, or incessantly: (TA:)
and ابتركت السَّمَآءُ (assumed tropical:)  the sky rained continually;
as also ↓ بَرَكَت, (K,) and ↓ ابركت; but Sgh
says that the first of these three is the most
correct. (TA.) And ابتركت السَّحَابَةُ (tropical:)  The cloud
rained vehemently. (K, TA.) ―
-b5-  ابترك فِى عِرْضِهِ,
and عَلَيْهِ, (tropical:)  He detracted from his reputation,
censured him, or impugned his character, and
reviled him, (K, TA,) and laboured in vituperating him. (TA.) ابتركوا فِى الحَرْبِ (tropical:)  They
fell upon their knees in battle, and so fought one
another. (K, TA. [See بَرَكَآءُ, below.])
-A2-  اِبْتَرَكْتُهُ

and put him beneath my بَرْك [i. e. breast]. (S.)
بَرْكٌ Many camels: (S, K:) or a herd of
camels lying down upon their breasts: (K:) or
any camels, males and females, lying down upon
their breasts by the water or in the desert by
reason of the heat of the sun or by reason of
satiety: (TA:) or all the camels of the people
of an encampment, that return to them from
pasture in the evening, or afternoon, to whatever
number they may amount, even if they be thousands: (K:) one thereof is termed ↓ بَارِكٌ; (K;)
the two words being like تَجْرٌ and تَاجِرٌ; (TA;)
fem. ↓ بَارِكَةٌ: (K:) pl. بُرُوكٌ, (S, K,) i. e., pl.
of بَرْكٌ. (S.)
-A2-  Also, (S, Msb, K,) and ↓ بِرْكَةٌ,
which is with kesr, (S, K,) The breast (S, Msb,
K) of a camel: (Msb, TA:) this is the primary
signification: (TA:) as some say, the former
signifies the breast of the camel with which he
crushes a thing beneath it: (TA:) and (K)
accord. to Lth, (TA,) the latter is the part next
to the ground of the skin of the breast of the
camel; (or, as in the 'Eyn, of the skin of the
belly of the camel and of the portion of the breast
next to it; TA;) as also the former: (K:) or, as
some say, the former is the middle of the breast,
where [the two prominences of flesh called] the
فَهْدَتَانِ conjoin at their upper parts: (Ham
p. 66:) or the latter is pl. of the former, like
as حِلْيَةٌ is of حَلْىٌ: or the former is of man;
and the latter, of others: or the former is the
interior of the breast; (or, as Yaakoob says, the
middle of the breast; TA;) and the latter, the
exterior thereof: (K:) or the former is the
breast, primarily of the camel, because camels lie
down (تَبْرُكُ) upon the breast; and metaphorically
of others. (Ham p. 145.) ―
-b2-  Hence, بَرْك الشِّتَآءِ
(tropical:)  The first part of winter; (L, TA; *) and the
main part thereof. (L.) ―
-b3-  And hence, (TA,)
البُرُوكُ is an appellation applied to (tropical:)  The stars
composing the constellation of the Scorpion, of
which are الزُّبَانَى and الإِكْلِيلُ and القَلْبُ and
الشَّوْلَةُ [the 16th and 17th and 18th and 19th of
the Mansions of the Moon], which rise [aurorally]
in the time of intense cold; as is also الجُثُومُ: (L,
TA: *) or, accord. to IF, to a نَوْء of the أَنْوَآء
of الجَوْزَآء; because the انواء thereof do not set
[aurorally] without there being during their period
a day and a night in which the camels lie upon
their breasts (تَبْرُكُ) by reason of the vehemence
of the cold and rain. (TA.)

بِرْكٌ: see بِرْكَةٌ.
بُرَكٌ Remaining fixed (↓ بَارِكٌ) at, or by, a thing.

swallows closely-consecutive mouthfuls. (IAar.)

pls. of the pl. [بُرَكٌ]. (TA.)

camel's kneeling and lying down upon the breast];

O.) One says, مَا أَحْسَنَ بِرْكَةَ هٰذِهِ النَّاقَةِ [How

the breast!]. (S.)

Arabs to the tanks, or cisterns, that are constructed with baked bricks, and plastered with
lime, in the road to Mekkeh, and at its wateringplaces; sing. بِرْكَةٌ; and sometimes a بركة is a
thousand cubits [in length], and less, and more:
but the watering-troughs, or tanks, that are made
for the rain-water, and not cased with baked
bricks, are called أَصْنَاعٌ, sing. صِنْعٌ: (TA:) [بِرْكَةٌ
often signifies a basin; a pool; a pond; and a
lake: and in the present day, also a bay of the
sea: and a reach of a river:] also a place where
water remains and collects, or collects and stagnates, or remains long and becomes altered. (ISd,
K.)
بَرَكَةٌ [A blessing; any good that is bestowed
by God; and particularly such as continues and
increases and abounds:] good, (Jel in xi. 50,) or
