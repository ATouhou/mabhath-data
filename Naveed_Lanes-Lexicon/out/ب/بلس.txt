بَلِسٌ Despairing, (مُبْلِسٌ,) and silent respecting
what is in his mind, (K, TA,) by reason of grief
or fear. (TA.)
بَلَاسٌ, (S, Msb, K,) like سَلَامٌ, (Msb,) and
سَحَابٌ, (K,) [in a copy of the M written بِلَاسٌ,]
A [garment, or piece of stuff, of the kind called]
مِسْح [i. e. of hair-cloth]: (S, M, Msb, K:) used
in this sense by the people of El-Medeeneh: (S:)
a Persian word; (AO, S, Msb;) originally بَلَاسٌ,
without ال: (TA:) arabicized: (S, Msb:) also
called by the Arabs پَلَاس, with the ب termed
مُشَبَّع: (TA:) pl. بُلُسٌ. (M, Msb, K.) [The pl.]
بُلُسٌ is also applied to Large sacks of مُسُوح [i. e.
hair-cloths], in which figs are put, [or, more probably, in which straw is put, for التِّين, which I
find in two copies of the S and in the TA, can
hardly be doubted to be a mistranscription of
التِّبْن], and upon which is paraded he who is
made a public example that others may take
warning from him, and the subject of a proclamation [acquainting the spectators with his offence]:
whence the imprecation, أَرَانِيكَ اللّٰهُ عَلَىالبُلُسِ
[May God show me thee upon the large haircloth-sacks]. (S, TA.)
بَلَسَانٌ [The balsam-tree; or the species that
produces the balsam of Mekkeh; i. e., the amyris
opobalsamum;] a certain kind of tree, (M,) or
shrub, resembling the حِنَّآء, (K,) having many
leaves, inclining to white, in odour resembling the
سَذَاب [or rue], (TA,) the berry of which has an
unguent, (Lth, M, TA,) which is hot, (Lth, TA,)
and its unguent is in great request: (Lth, K,
TA:) its unguent [opobalsamum] is more potent
than its berry [carpobalsamum], and its berry is
more so than its wood [xylobalsamum] : the best
of its wood is the smooth, tawny-coloured, pungent and sweet in odour: it is hot and dry in the
second degree; and its berry is a little hotter than
it: its wood opens stoppages of the nose, and is
good for the sciatica and vertigo and headache,
and clears cloudiness of the eye, and is good for
asthma and oppression of the breath, and for
flaccidity of the womb, used by fumigation; it is
also beneficial in cases of barrenness, and counteracts poisons and the bite of vipers: (the Minháj,
TA:) it is said in the K and in the Minháj, and
by most of the physicians and those who treat of
drugs, that it grows only at 'Eyn-Shems, in the
neighbourhood of El-Káhireh, the place called ElMatareeyeh; but MF observes that this is strange,
as it is well known that it is mostly found in the
district of El-Hijáz, between the Harameyn and
El-Yembo' , whence it is conveyed to all countries:
the truth, however, is, that it ceased to grow at
' Eyn-Shems in the latter part of the eighth century [of the Flight], and it was endeavoured
[successfully] to be made to grow in El-Hijáz.
(TA.) [See also De Sacy's “ Abd-allatif,” p. 89.]
بَلَّاسٌ One who sells what is termed بَلَاس. (K.)
إِبْلِيسُ [A name of Satan]; from أَبْلَسَ, (S, M,
Msb, K,) in the first of the senses assigned to it
above, (S, M, Msb,) accord. to some; (M, Msb,
K;) his former name being عَزَازِيلُ : (S, TA:) or
it is a foreign word, (Aboo-Is-hák, M, Msb, K,)
and for this reason, (Aboo-Is-hák, M, Msb, TA,)
and its being also determinate, (Aboo-Is-hák, M,
TA,) or a proper name, (Msb,) it is imperfectly
decl.; (Aboo-Is-hák, M, &c.;) for if it were an
Arabic word, it would be perfectly decl., like
إِجْفِيلٌ and إِخْرِيطٌ. (Msb.)
