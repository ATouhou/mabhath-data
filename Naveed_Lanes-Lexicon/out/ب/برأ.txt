aor.
بَرَاَ; and بَرُؤَ, aor.
بَرُاَ; (Msb;) inf. n. بُرْءٌ: (T,
Msb:) or بَرِئَ من المرض, inf. n. بُرْءٌ, with
damm; and the people of El-Hijáz say بَرَأَ, inf. n.
بَرْءٌ, with fet-h: (S:) accord. to As, بَرِىَ من
المرض is of the dial. of Temeem; and بَرَأَ of the
dial. of the people of El-Hijáz: or, accord. to
AZ, the people of El-Hijáz say بَرَأَ; and the rest
of the Arabs say بَرِئَ: (T:) or بَرَأَ [alone], said
of a sick man, aor.
بَرُاَ and
بَرَاَ; and بَرِئَ; and بَرُؤَ;
inf. n. بَرْءٌ [probably a mistranscription for بُرْءٌ]
and بُرُؤٌ: or, accord. to Lh, the people of El-
Hijáz say بَرَأَ, aor.
بَرُاَ, inf. n. بُرْءٌ and بُرُؤٌ [i. e.
بُرُوْءٌ]; and the people of El-'Áliyeh, [بَرَأَ,] aor.
بَرَاَ,
inf. n. بُرْءٌ and بُرُؤُ; and Temeem, بَرِئَ, [aor.
بَرَاَ,]
inf. n. بُرْءٌ and بُرُؤٌ: (M:) or بَرَأَ, (K,) said by
IKtt to be the most chaste form, (TA,) aor.
بَرَاَ,
(K,) agreeably with analogy, (TA,) and
بَرُاَ, (K,)
said by Zj to be the only instance of a verb of
the measure فَعَلَ with ء for its last radical letter
having its aor. of the measure يَفْعُلُ, [though
others mention also قَرَأَ, aor. يَقْرُؤُ, and هَنَأَ, aor.
يَهْنُؤُ,] and asserted to be a bad form, (TA,)
inf. n. بُرْءٌ and بُرُوْءٌ; and بَرُؤَ, (K,) not a chaste
form, (TA,) aor.
بَرُاَ; and بَرِئَ, (K,) a chaste
form, (TA,) [and the most common of all,]

بَرَاَ, inf. n. بَرْءٌ and بُرُؤٌ, (K, TA,) or بُرْءٌ, (CK,)
and بُرُوْءٌ; (K, TA;) He became free from the
disease, sickness, or malady: (T:) or [he recovered

healthy, at the close of disease, but was yet weak;
or he recovered, but not completely, his health
and strength; syn. نِقَهَ; (M, K;) i. e., he acquired that slight degree of soundness, or health,
which comes at the close of disease, but with
disease remaining in him. (TA.) [And بَرِئَ
الجُرْجُ, or بَرَأَ, The wound healed; or became in
a healing state: of frequent occurrence.] And
بَرِئَ مِنَ الأَمْرِ, [the only form of the verb used in
this case, and in the other cases in which it is mentioned below,] aor.
بَرَاَ and
بَرُاَ, the latter extr., (M,
K,) or rather it is very strange, for IKoot says
that نَعِمَ, aor. يَنْعُمُ, and فَضِلَ, aor. يَفْضُلُ, are
the only instances of this kind, (TA,) inf. n.
بَرَآءَةٌ (M, K) and بَرَآءٌ (Lh, M, K) and بُرُؤٌ, (M,)
or بُرْءٌ, (K, TA,) or بُرُوْءٌ; (CK;) and ↓ تبرّأ; (S, *
M, K, Mgh; *) [He was, or became, free from
the thing, or affair; or clear, or quit, thereof;
clear of having or taking, or of having had or
taken, any part therein; guiltless of it: and
also, irresponsible for it; as in an ex. q. v. voce
عِضَاضٌ:] said in relation to [a fault or the like,
and] a debt, and a claim, and religion [&c.].
(Lh, M.) You say, بَرِئَ مِنَ العَيْبِ, (Mgh, Msb,)
or العُيُوبِ, (S,) inf. n. بَرَآءَةٌ, (Mgh,) He was,
or became, free (Msb) [from the fault, defect,
imperfection, blemish, or vice], (Mgh, Msb,) [or

Mgh, Msb,) or الدُّيُونِ, (S,) aor.
بَرَاَ, (T, Msb,)
inf. n. بَرَآءَةٌ, (T, Mgh, Msb,) He was, or became,
clear, or quit, of the debt; (or debts; S;) irresponsible for it [or them]: or in a state of immunity with respect to it [or them]; i. e., exempt
from the demand thereof. (Msb.) And بَرئَ
إِلَيْكَ مِنْ حَقِّكَ, inf. n. بَرَآءَةٌ and بَرَآءٌ (Lh, M)
and بُرُؤٌ, [He was, or became, clear, or quit, to
thee, of thy claim, or due, or right; or exempt
from the demand thereof;] as also ↓ تبرّأ. (M.)
And بَرِئْتُ إِلَيْكَ مِنْ فُلَانٍ, inf. n. بَرَآءةٌ, [I was,
or became, or have become, clear, to thee, of having
or taking, or of having had or taken, any part with
such a one; or, irresponsible to thee for such a
one:] (AZ, T, S: * [in one copy of the S, I find
the phrase بَرِئْتُ مِنْكَ, commencing the art.; but
not in other copies:]) this is the only form of the
verb used in this case, and in relation to debt [and
the like]. (AZ, T.) ―
-b2-  He removed himself, or
kept, far, or aloof, [from unclean things, or things
occasioning blame; followed by مِنْ, with which
it may be rendered he shunned, or avoided;]
syn. تَنَزَّهُ and تَبَاعَدَ. (T.) [You say, بَرِئَ مِنَ
الأَقْذَارِ He removed himself, or kept, far, or
aloof, from unclean things.] ―
-b3-  He manifested
an excuse, [or asserted himself to be clear or quit
or irresponsible, like ↓ تبرّأ,] and gave warning;
syn. أَعْذَرَ and أَنْذَرَ. (T.) Hence, in the Kur
[ix. 1], بَرَآءَةٌ مِنَ اللّٰهِ وَرَسُولِهِ A manifestation of
excuse, and a warning, from God and his apostle.
(T.)
-A2-  بَرَأَ اللّٰهُ الخَلْقَ, (Fr, T, S, M, K,) or الخَلِيَقَةَ,
(Msb,) aor.
بَرَاَ, (T, M, &c.,) inf. n. بَرْءٌ (T, S, M,
K) and بُرُوْءٌ, (AZ, Lh, M, K,) God created
mankind, or the beings, or things, that are created,
syn. خَلَقَ, (Fr, T, M, Msb, K,) after no similitude, or model, (TA,) [but, properly, though not
always meaning so, out of pre-existing matter;
for] Bd says [in ii. 51] that the primary meaning
of the root برء is to denote a thing's becoming
clear, or free, of, or from, another thing; either
by being released [therefrom], as in بَرِئَ المَرِيضُ
مِنْ مَرَضِهِ and المَدْيُونُ مِنْ دَينِهِ [both sufficiently
explained above]; or by production [therefrom],
as in بَرَأَ اللّٰهُ آدَمَ مِنَ الطِّينِ [God produced, or
created, Adam, from, or out of, clay]. (TA.)
This verb relates to substances [as in the exs.
given above] and to accidents; and hence, [in
the Kur lvii. 22,] مِنْ قبْلِ أَنْ نَبْرَأَهَا [Before our
creating it, if ها refer to مُصِيبَة, preceding it;
but, as Bd says, it may refer to this, or to الأَرْض,
or to أَنْفُس]: (M:) but البَرْءُ has a more particular
application than الخَلْقُ; the former being particularly applied to the creation of animate beings,
with few exceptions: you say, بَرَأَ اللّٰهُ النَّسَمَةَ
وَ خَلَقَ السَّمٰوَاتِ وَالأَرْضَ [God created, or produced,
man, or the soul, and He created the heavens
and the earth]. (TA.) [To this verb, or perhaps
to بَرَي, or to both,
בָּרָ is the Hebrew equivalent, properly (though not necessarily always) signifying “ he created out of pre-existing matter,”
or “ he fashioned. ”]
2
برّأهُ, inf. n. تَبْرئَةٌ: see 4, in four places.
[Hence,] لَا التَّبْرِئَةِ The لا that denies in a general
manner, absolutely, or to the uttermost; i. e. the
لا that is a universal negative. (Mughnee &c.)
―
-b2-  Also He verified his being free [from a thing],
clear, or quit, [of it,] guiltless [of it], or irresponsible [for it]. (Mgh, TA.)
3
بارأهُ, (T, S, M, Mgh, K,) inf. n. مُبَارَأَةٌ (T,
M, Mgh) and بِرَآءٌ, (M,) He made him (his copartner) free, clear, quit, or irresponsible, the
latter doing to him the same: (Mgh:) he compounded, or made a compromise, with him (his
hired man, T, M) for their mutual separation:
(M:) he separated himself from him (his copartner, S, O), the latter doing the same. (S, O,
K.) And بَارَأْتُ الرَّجُلَ I became free, clear, quit,
or irresponsible, to the man, he becoming so to
me. (M.) And بارأ المَرْأَةَ, (T, M, K,) or امْرَأَتَهُ,
(S,) inf. n. as above, (M,) He compounded, or
made a compromise, with the woman (or his wife,
S) for their mutual separation; (M, K;) i. e.
he divorced her for a compensation [which she
was to make him, such as her giving up a
portion of her dowry remaining due to her, in
order that they might be clear, each of the other]:
it occurs also [without ء] in art. برى. (TA.)
4
ابرأهُ He (God, S, M, K) [recovered him, or]
restored him to convalescence, (M, K,) مِنَ المَرَضِ
[from the disease, sickness, or malady]. (S.) ―
-b2-
أَبْرَأَكَ مِنَ الأَمْرِ and ↓ بَرَّأَكَ (M, K *) He (i. e.
God, TA) made thee, pronounced thee, or held thee,
or hath made thee, &c., or may He make thee, &c.,
to be free from the thing or affair, or clear or
quit thereof, or guiltless thereof, or irresponsible
for it; (TA;) [or He acquitted thee, or hath
acquitted thee, or may He acquit thee, thereof;
or He showed thee, or hath showed thee, or may
He show thee, to be free from it, &c.: see also 2,
above:] said in relation to [a fault or the like,
and] a debt, and a claim, and religion [&c.].
(M.) You say, مِنَ العَيْبِ ↓ بَرَّأْتُهُ I made him,
pronounced him, or held him, to be free from
the fault, defect, imperfection, blemish, or vice.
(Msb.) It is said in the Kur [xxxiii. 69], ↓ فَبَرَّأْهُ
اللّٰهُ مِمَا قَالُوا (M) But God showed him to be
clear of that which they said. (Bd.) You say
also, أَبْرَأْتُهُ مِنَ الدَّيْنِ I made him, pronounced
him, or held him, to be clear, or quit, of the
debt; irresponsible for it; or in a state of immunity with respect to it; i. e., exempt from
the demand thereof: (Msb:) and أَبْرَأْتُهُ مِمَّا لِى
عَلَيْهِ; and ↓ بَرَّأْتُهُ, inf. n. تَبْرِئَةٌ; [I acquitted him
of that which he owed me:] (S:) and أَبْرَأْتُهُ
[alone] I made him, pronounced him, or held
him, to be clear, or quit, of a claim that I had
upon him, or a due or right that he owed me.
(Mgh.)
-A2-  ابرأ [in the T (as on the authority of
Aboo-'Amr Esh-Sheybánee) أَبْرَى] He entered
upon [the night, or day, called] البَرَآء, q. v. (K.)
5
تَبَرَّاَ see 1, in three places. تبرّأ مِنْهُ also signifies
He asserted himself to be free from it; or clear,
or quit, of it; namely, a fault, or the like.
(Mgh.) [And He declared himself to be clear of
him; to be not connected, or implicated, with him;
he renounced him: see Kur ii. 161 and 162, &c:]
6
تَبَارَأْنَا We separated ourselves, each from
the other. (TA.) [See 3.]
10
استبرأ, (T,) or استبرأ مِنَ البَوْلِ, (Msb,) He
took extraordinary pains, or the utmost pains,
in cleansing the orifice of his penis from the
remains of urine, by shaking it and pulling it
and the like, until he knew that nothing remained
in it: (T:) or he purified, or cleansed, himself
from urine; syn. تَنَزَّهُ عَنْهُ: (Msb:) or استبرأ,
(M,) or استبرأ الذَّكَرَ, (K, TA,) signifies he took
extraordinary pains, or the utmost pains, in
cleansing the penis from urine; or he cleansed
it entirely from urine; (M, * K, * TA;) and so
استبرأ الفَرْجَ: and in like manner, استبرأتِ الفَرْجَ
said of a woman: (El-Munáwee, TA:) but the
lawyers make a distinction between اسْتِبْرَآءٌ and
اِسْتِنْقَآءٌ [which are made syn. in the M and K]:
see the latter word. (TA.) ―
-b2-  And استبرأ الجَارِيَةَ,
(T, S, Mgh,) or المَرْأَةَ, (M, Msb, K,) He abstained
from sexual intercourse (T, M, K) with the
girl whom he had purchased or whom he had
taken captive, (T,) or with the woman, (M, K,)
until she had menstruated (T, M, K) at his abode,
once, and then become purified: (T:) the meaning is, (T,) he sought to find her free from
pregnancy. (T, Mgh, Msb.) ―
-b3-  Hence, (Mgh,)
استبرأ الشَّيْءِ, (Z, Mgh, Msb,) or الأَمْرَ, (TA,) He
searched, searched out, or sought to find or discover,
the uttermost of the thing, or affair, (Z, Mgh,
Msb, TA,) in order that he might know it, (Mgh,)
to put an end to his doubt. (Z, Mgh, Msb, TA.)
You say, اِسْتَبْرَأْتُ مَا عِنْدَكَ [I searched, or sought
to find or discover, or I have searched, &c., the
uttermost of what thou hast, of knowledge &c.].
(S, TA.) And استبرأ أرْضَ كَذَا فَمَا وَجَدَ ضَالَّتَهُ
[He searched the uttermost of such a land and
found not his stray beast]. (TA.) It is said
in the Expos. of the Jámi' es-Sagheer that
اِسْتِبْرَآءٌ is an expression denoting The seeking, or
seeking leisurely and repeatedly, to obtain knowledge of a thing, until one knows it; considering
it with the endeavour to obtain a clear knowledge
of it; taking, in doing so, the course prescribed
by prudence, precaution, or good judgment.
(Mgh.)
بُرُأَةٌ A hunter's lurking-place or covert: (T, S,
M, K:) pl. بُرَأٌ. (T, S, M.) El-Aashà says,
بِهَا بُرَأٌ مِثْلُ الفَسِيلِ المُكَمَّمِ
[At it (a source of water mentioned in the context)
were hunters' lurking-places, like young palmtrees covered over: for tender young palm-trees
are often covered over with a kind of coarse
matting]. (T, S, M.)
بَرَآءٌ: see بَرِىْءٌ, in six places. ―
-b2-  البَرَآءٌ The first
night of the [lunar] month; (El-Mázinee, T, S,
K;) called thus, (S,) or لَيْلَةُ البَرَآءِ, (M,) because
the moon has then become clear of the sun: (S,
M:) or the first day of the month: (AA, T, K:)
or the last night thereof: (As, T, K:) or the last
day thereof; (IAar, T, K;) a fortunate day;
every event happening therein being regarded as
a means of obtaining a blessing; (IAar, T;) but
most hold that the last day of the month is termed
النَّحِيرَةٌ; (TA;) as also اِبْنُ البَرَآءِ: (K:) or this
is the first day of the month: (IAar, T, TA:) pl.
أَبْرِئَةٌ. (Th, M.)
بُرَآءُ: see بَرِىْءٌ, in two places.
بَرِىْءٌ Free, (Msb,) مِنْهُ from it; namely a
fault, defect, imperfection, blemish, or vice;
(Mgh, Msb;) and, also followed by مِنْهُ, clear,
or quit, of it; irresponsible for it; or in a state
of immunity with respect to it; i. e. exempt from
the demand thereof; namely a debt, (Msb,) or a
claim, or due, or right; (Mgh;) as also ↓ بَارِىٌ
and ↓ بَرَآءٌ. (Msb.) You say, أَنَا بَرِىْءٌ مِنْهُ [I am
free from it, &c.]; (T, * S, M, K; *) and ↓ بَرَآءٌ,
used alike as sing. and dual and pl. (Fr, T, S, M,
K) and masc. and fem., (Fr, T, M, K,) because
it is originally an inf. n.; (Fr, T, S;) and ↓ بُرَآءٌ:
(S, M:) the pl. of بَرِىْءٌ is بَرِيؤُونَ (T, S, K) and
بُرَأءُ (T, S, M, K) and بُرَآءٌ, (T, M, K,) of the measure فُعَالٌ, (T,) like رُخَالٌ, (M, K,) of an extr.
measure, disapproved by Suh, who says, in the
R, that it is a contraction of بُرَأءُ, and has tenween
because it resembles [words originally of the measure] فُعَالٌ, and that the rel. n. formed from it is
↓ بُرَاوِىٌّ, (TA,) but it is mentioned by AAF as a
pl. of بَرِىْءٌ, and as being like رُخَالٌ, and Fr mentions بُرَآءُ as a pl. of the same, imperfectly decl.,
with one of the two hemzehs suppressed, (M,)
and بِرَآءٌ (S, M, K) and أَبْرَآءٌ (S, K) and أَبْرِئَآءُ, (T,
S, K,) the last two anomalous: (TA:) the fem.
of بَرِيْءٌ is بَرِيْئَةٌ; pl. بَرِيْآتٌ (T, S, M, K) and
بَرِيَّاتٌ (Lh, M, K) and بَرَايَا. (T, S, M, K.) You
say, أَنَا بَرِىْءٌ مِنْهُ and خَلِىٌّ مِنْهُ [I am free from
it; or, more commonly, I am clear, or quit, of
it, or him]; and مِنْهُ ↓ أنَا بَرَآءٌ and خَلَآءٌ مِنْهُ; (S;)
and مِنْهُ ↓ أَنَا البَرَآءُ: (M:) and ↓ نَحْنُ مِنْكَ البَرَآءُ
and الخَلَآءُ [We are clear, or quit, of you]; (Fr,
T;) i. e., ذَوُو البَرَآءِ: so says Aboo-Is-hák; and
As says the like of what Fr says. (T.) It is said
in the Kur [xliii. 25], مِمَّا تَعْبُدُونَ ↓ إِنَّنِى بَرَآءٌ
[Verily I am clear of that which ye worship];
(T, M;) or بَرِىْءٌ, or ↓ بُرَآءٌ; accord. to different
readers. (Bd.) بَرِىْءٌ occurs in several places in
the Kur. (M.) Accord. to IAar, it signifies
Clear of evil qualities or dispositions; shunning
what is vain and false; remote from actions that
occasion suspicion; pure in heart from associating
any with God: and it signifies sound in body and
intellect. (T.) See also بَارِئٌ, in two places.
بَرَآءَةٌ A writing of [i. e. conferring] immunity
or exemption: from بَرِئَ مِنَ الدَّيْنِ and العَيْب, of
which it is the inf. n.: pl. بَرَاآتٌ, with medd:
بَرَاوَاتٌ is [pl. of بَرَاةٌ, and both of these are] vulgar.
(Mgh.)
بُرَاوِىٌّ: see بَرِىْءٌ.
البَرِيَّةُ The creation; as meaning the beings, or
things, that are created; or, particularly, mankind; syn. الخَلْقُ: (T, S, M:) pronounced without ء; (T, S;) originally with ء, like نَبِىٌّ and
ذُرِّيَةٌ; (M;) and the people of Mekkeh differ
from the other Arabs in pronouncing these three
words with ء: (Yoo, T, M:) Lh says that the
Arabs agree in omitting the ء in these three instances; and he does not except the people of
Mekkeh: (M:) it is of the measure فَعِيلَةٌ in the
sense of مَفْعُولَةٌ, (Msb,) from بَرَأَ اللّٰهُ الخَلْقَ, meaning خَلَقَهُمْ: (Fr, T:) or, if derived from البَرَى
[“earth” or “dust”], it is originally without ء:
(Fr, T, S:) pl. بَرَايَا and بَرِيَّاتٌ. (S in art. برو
and برى.)
بَارِئٌ, (K,) or بَارِئٌ مِنْ مَرَضِهِ, (Lh, S, M,)
[Recovering from his disease, sickness, or malady:
or] convalescent; or becoming sound, or healthy,
at the close of his disease, but being yet weak; or
recovering, but not completely, his health and
strength: [see 1:] (M, K:) as also ↓ بَرِئْءٌ: (Lh,
M, K:) but whether the latter be properly used
in this sense is disputed; while the former is said
to be the act. part. n. of 1 in all its senses: (TA:)
pl. بِرَآءٌ, (M, K,) like as صِحَاحٌ is pl. of صَحِيحٌ,
accord. to Lh, so that he holds it to be pl. of
بَرِىْءٌ; or it may be pl. of بَارِئٌ, like as جِيَاعٌ is
pl. of جَائِعٌ, and صِحَابٌ of صَاحِبٌ. (M.) ↓ بَرِىْءٌ
is sometimes written and pronounced بَرِىٌّ [in all
its senses]. (Kz.) ―
-b2-  See also بَرِيْءٌ.
-A2-  البَارِئُ,
applied to God, The Creator; (T, S, Msb;) He
who hath created the things that are created, not
after any similitude, or model; (Nh;) or He who
hath created those things free from any incongruity, or faultiness, (Mgh, and Bd in ii. 51,)
and distinguished, one from another, by various
forms and outward appearances: (Bd:) or the
Former, or Fashioner; syn. المُصَوِّرُ [q. v.]. (M.)
