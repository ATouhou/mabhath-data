بسن4
ابسن, said of a man, He was, or became
good, or beautiful, in respect of his سَجِيَّة [i. e.
natural disposition], accord. to the copies of the
K, but correctly, as explained by IAar, his سَحْنَة
[i. e. aspect, or colour, &c.]. (TA.)
بَسَنٌ an imitative sequent to حَسَنٌ: (S, M, K:)
[or it may signify Beautiful in aspect &c., from
the verb above; or the verb may be from this
word:] or, in the opinion of Aboo-'Alee El-Kálee,
originally بَسٌّ inf. n., used in the sense of the
pass. part. n., of بَسَّ السَّوِيقَ, meaning “he moistened, or stirred about, the سويق with clarified
butter, or with olive-oil, to complete, or perfect,
its goodness; ” one of the two س s being suppressed, and ن being added; so that it means
complete, or perfect. (MF. [But this derivation
seems to be extremely far-fetched.])
