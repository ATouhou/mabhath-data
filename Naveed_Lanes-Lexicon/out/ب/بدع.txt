unaccustomed thing: (TA:) or ابداع is not without limping, or halting, or slight lameness, (K,
TA,) accord. to certain of the Arabs of the desert;
but, says AO, this is not at variance with the
explanations given. (TA.) And أُبْدِعَ بِالرَّجُلِ The

طَلَبْتَ البَاطِلَ أُبْدِعَ بِكَ [When thou seekest what is

―
-b4-  أَبْدَعَتْ حُجَّتُهُ (tropical:)  His argument, or plea, or the

فَلَيْسَ وَجْهَ الحَقِّ أَنْ تَبَدَّعَا
[If thou be, towards God, the pious, the very
obedient, it is not the right way that thou shouldst
turn innovator]. (TA.)

بِدْعٌ i. q. ↓ بَدِيعٌ, q. v., and ↓ مُبْتَدَعٌ; (S;)
[but generally used as an epithet in which the
quality of a subst. is predominant; signifying]
A novelty; or thing existing for the first time:
(K:) and i. q. ↓ بَدِيعٌ and ↓ مُبْتَدِعٌ, a first doer;
as though meaning one who has none among his
fellows to share, or participate, with him in a
thing, or an affair: (Msb:) pl. أَبْدَاعٌ. (Akh,
S.) You say, فُلَانٌ بِدْعٌ فِى هٰذا الأَمْرِ, (S, Msb,)
i. e. ↓ بَدِيعٌ, (S,) meaning Such a one is the first
doer in this affair; the first who has done it.

قُلْ مَا كُنْتُ بِدْعًا مِنَ الرُّسُلِ (S, Msb, TA) Say
thou, I am not the first who has been sent of
the apostles: (Msb, TA:) or the meaning is, I
am not an innovator among the apostles; inviting
you to that to which they do not invite you; or
able to do that which they were not able to do:
and accord. to one reading, it is ↓ بِدَعًا; as being
[a sing. epithet] like قِيَمٌ; or for ذَا بِدَعٍ [in
which the latter word is pl. of بِدْعَةٌ]. (Bd.) ―

having been or existed before, and not after the
similitude of anything pre-existing: (ISK:) a
dissentient state or condition: (Msb:) a subst.
from اِبْتِدَاعٌ, like رِفْعَةٌ from اِرْتِفَاعٌ, (Mgh, Msb,)

or swerving, from the right way, and an action,
innovated after [the time of] the Prophet: (Lth,
K:) or an action at variance with the Sunneh:
(KT:) [generally a heretical innovation; or a
new heresy: but] there is a بدعة not disapproved,
termed بِدْعَةٌ مُبَاحَةٌ [an allowed, or allowable,
innovation]; which is that whereof the goodness
is attested by some principle in the law, or which
is required to prevent some cause of evil; such
as the Khaleefeh's seclusion of himself from the
promiscuous classes of the people: (Msb:) there
are two kinds of بدعة; namely بِدْعَةٌ هُدًى [an
innovation of a right kind], and بِدْعَةٌ ضَلَالٍ [an
innovation of an erroneous kind]. (IAth.)
بَدِيعٌ i. q. بِدْعٌ, which see in three places, (S,
Msb,) and ↓ مُبْتَدَعٌ; [i. e. Originated; invented;
innovated; made, done, produced, caused to be
or exist, or brought into existence, newly, for the
first time, not having been or existed before, and
not after the similitude of anything pre-existing;]
(S, Msb, K;) new; wonderful; unknown before.
(TA.) You say, جِئْتَ بِأَمْرٍ بَدِيعٍ Thou hast done
a new thing; a wonderful thing; a thing unknown
before: and ↓ أَمْرٌ بَادِعٌ signifies the same as أَمْرٌ
بَدِيعٌ. (TA.) And جَآءَ بِا لبَدِيعِ, (S,) or أَتَى
بِالبَدَيعِ, (K,) said of a poet, (S, K,) He produced
a new saying, or new poetry, not after the similitude of anything preceding. (TA.) And حَبْلٌ
بَدشيعٌ A new rope: (AHn:) or a rope begun to
be twisted, not being yet a rope, but undone, then
spun, then twisted again. (K.) And زِمَامٌ بَدِيعٌ

And بَدِيعٌ alone, A skin for wine &c.: (S:) or
a new skin for wine &c.: (K:) and a new skin
for water or milk: an epithet in which the
quality of a subst. is predominant. (TA.) Hence
the trad., إِنَّ تِهَامَةَ كَبَدِيعِ العَسَلِ حُلْوٌ أَوَّلُهُ حُلْوٌ
آخِرُهُ [Verily Tihámeh is like the skin, or new skin,
of honey: the first part thereof is sweet: the last
part thereof is sweet]: (S, K *:) because honey does
not change in flavour, whereas milk does change.
(S.) ―
-b2-  Fat; as an epithet: (As, K:) pl. بُدْعٌ.
(K.)
-A2-  Also i. q. ↓ مُبْتَدِعٌ [An originator, inventor, or innovator; one who makes, does, produces, causes to be or exist, or brings into existence,
newly, for the first time, and not after the similitude of anything pre-existing]: (S, K:) of the
measure فَعِيلٌ in the sense of the measure فَاعِلٌ,
like قَدِيرٌ in the sense of قَادِرٌ; from بَدَعَ. (TA.)
[See also بِدْعٌ.] You say, اَللّٰهُ بَدِيعٌ السَّمٰوَاتِ وَالأَرْضِ
God is the Creator of the heavens and the earth,
not after the similitude of anything pre-existing.
(Aboo-Is-hák, S. *) And hence البَدِيعُ is a name
of God, meaning The Originator of the creation,

of anything pre-existing. (TA.)
