باجبَأْجٌ, also pronounced بَاجٌ, without ء, (IAar, S,
Msb, K,) but the former alone is mentioned by
Th in the Fs, and is the chaste word, (TA,)
arabicized, from the Persian بَاهَا, (S,) A sort, or
species, (S, K,) of food, or viands. (S.) Hence
the saying, اِجْعَلِ البَأْجَات بَإْجاً وَاحِدًا [Make thou
the sorts, or species, of food, or viands, to be one
sort, or species]: (S, K:) occurring in a trad., in
which it is without ء in each case, accord. to
IDrst: several different sorts of food being brought
to 'Omar, he asked respecting them, and it was
said, [They are] سِكْبَاج and زِرْبَاج and إِسْفِيدْبَاج;
whereupon he ordered that the bowls should be
brought, and their contents were emptied into
one; he saying the words above. (Marginal note
in a copy of the S.) IKh says that a man would
bring various sorts [of food], and one would say,
اِجْعَلْهَا بأْجاً وَاحدِا [Make thou them to be one
sort]. (TA.) The pl. is [بَأْجَاتٌ, as shown above,
as though the sing. were بَأْجَةٌ, and] أَبْوَاجٌ. (Msb,
TA.) لَأَجْعَلَنَّ النَّاسَ كُلَّهُمْ بَأْجًا وَاحِدًا is [likewise]
a saying of 'Omar, (Msb, TA,) meaning [I will
assuredly make the people, all of them, to be] one
body or assemblage; بَأْجٌ signifying a state of
assembling, or collecting together: (Kz, TA:) or
[of] one uniform way or mode or manner, (Msb,
TA,) as El-Fihree says in the Expos. of the
Fs, on the authority of ISd in the book entitled
El-'Awees; (TA;) i. e., in respect of gifts, or
allowances: (Msb:) accord. to IAar, it is from
بَأْجٌ or بَاجٌ signifying a uniform line of road.
(TA.) You say also, النَّاسُ بَأْجٌ وَاحِدٌ The people
are [as] one thing. (TA.) And هُمْ فِى أَمْرٍ بَأْجٍ
They are [in one and the same, or] in an equal,
or a uniform, case. (K.) And جَعَلَ الكَلَامَ بَأْجاً
وَاخِدًا He made the speech, or language, to be
[uniform, or] of one mode, or manner. (TA.)
And اِجْعَلْ هٰذا الشَّىْءَ بَأْجًا وَاحِدًا Make thou this
thing to be [uniform, or] of one way, or mode, or
manner. (ISk.) And اِجْعَلِ الأَمْرَ بَأْجًا وَاحِدًا
Make thou the affair, or case, [uniform, or] one
uniform thing. (Fr.)
