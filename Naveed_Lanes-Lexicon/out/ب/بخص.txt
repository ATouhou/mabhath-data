بَخَصَ عَيْنَهُ, (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K, &c.,) aor.
بَخَصَ,
(S, Mgh, K,) inf. n. بَخْصٌ, (S, Mgh,) He put out
his eye; syn. فَقَأَهَا, (Mgh,) and عَوَّرَهَا: (A, Mgh:)
or he pulled out his eye [altogether, i. e.,] with its
bulb: (S, K: [in the former, مَعض شَحْمَتِهَا: in the
latter, not so well, بِشَحْمِهَا:]) or he put his finger
into his eye: (Msb:) Yaakoob says that you
should not say بَخَسَ; (S;) and so says ISk:
(TA in art. بخس:) but accord. to As, as related
by Aboo-Turáb, you say بَخَصَ عَيْنَهُ and بَخَزَهَا
and بَخَسَهَا, all as meaning he put out his eye;
syn. فَقَأَهَا: (TA:) and IAar says that بَخَسَهَا and
بَخَصَهَا signify alike: (Msb:) the former of these
two is a dial. var. of the latter; (TA in art. بخس;)
and signifies he put it out (فَقَأَهَا) with his finger
or some other thing: (Lth, As, and K in art.
بخس:) but بَخَصَ is the better word. (Lh, IAar,
Msb.)
